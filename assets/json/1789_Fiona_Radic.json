  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_environment_page_2/content_463.html": "Since my first update on the collapse, the press got excited and phone calls were made. And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nThe Cambridge News published some of what I said along with a photo .\nPeterborough Telegraph believes the financial burden will fall upon the tenants of the block. I believe that this would be profoundly wrong and I will set out why in this second update.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nthat the approved planning application according to which the block was to be constructed is 96/00001/FUL | Validated: Mon 07 Oct 1996 | Status: Decided\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nBehind the sheeting is sand. Here is similar material taken from a picture about a road being built on the construction company’s Facebook page. This may or may not be what is behind the steel sheeting too.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.",

(I deplore the use of a word like “aggressive” to stereotype a wide community which cycles on pavements.)\nBut here we go again, this time with a word which suggests one superior tribe (maybe driving Chelsea tractors?) looking down on another primitive and uncivilised group (maybe all these things because they can’t afford a Chelsea tractor?).\nGiven that bicycles can’t really eat one another, I assume the police peep believes that the cyclists are stealing each others’ bicycles? I’m really not sure how such a useless assertion will help the police catch thieves. What I can tell the police is that this use of language is calculated to annoy cyclists with even the smallest bit of linguistic and political sensitivity.

This enables voters to get in touch. It also enables voters to see how much money is being spent on a campaign and who is donating that money (because election expenses and donations over a certain sum have to be reported after a certain date).

You can vote Green all over Peterborough. We raise money to pay for leaflets so that local people know they can vote for us. You can vote Green in Peterborough and North West Cambridgeshire constituencies. This all costs money.\nContrary to what the public assumes, our activists work for free: they volunteer. If you can’t volunteer, a financial contribution is the quickest and most effective way to support us. Back our Crowdfunder now.\nI don’t remember dreaming last night. I often dream. But last night I slept that dark recovery sleep which comes night after night when you have been sleep deprived for a long time. Like Guinness. Dark and deep. No images. But something important got stitched together in the night. As I swung out of bed I knew exactly why I had got so cross yesterday about the livestream being cancelled during the hustings at the St Johns Hustings on Tuesday. Anger is never a good thing, but it is the most important directional kick and motivator available. Incredibly powerful. Understanding it and reflecting on it matters: I always try to do that. I was puzzling about my feelings when I went to bed. But it took a whole night’s sleep to alert me to what had made me incandescent with fury yesterday.\nI’d been looking in the wrong place for the answer.\nLast night’s sleep brought me back to another painful memory. I am very aware of other candidates’ emotions: I’ve been upset several times. The way candidates are treated is very important. One party leader at the Tuesday railed against his candidate’s exclusion from the platform. I couldn’t help but sympathise. Candidates need so much support and help in doing what they try to do. It is impossible not to see the hurt and pain which they encounter on the way. During the night two memories of anger and a feeling of me personally being badly let down connected themselves together. I’d been reflecting on yet another occasion (yes standing for election is full of drama and high emotion!), but of course: it wasn’t that occasion which mattered.\nNearly the same thing happened before. Of course it did. I was told years ago at another hustings that a professional recording would be made and that it would be broadcast but it never was. My performance on the platform was pretty awful. But the broken promise was what mattered to and hurt me.\nThis morning I am calm. I realise this is a rerun of what has happened before. There is a pattern. The murderer of tracks may have struck before.\nThe trouble with getting upset about things is that you can’t always confront the actual problem so you embalm it in a better buried place in your consciousness in order to “move on”. This is especially true if you are a directly affected and traumatised candidate. But as it happens, this week I have a huge advantage. I am not the candidate. True I am in recovery from having been the candidate in two very exciting and over close together elections. But I am deliciously and delightfully free of the specific challenges which every candidates faces: including having to put a lot of very important things on one side in order to deal with the urgent things. And I can sleep. I am looking after another candidate. But I am not him. I can reflect. I can think. Bliss.\nA high level of disappointment between what was promised at an event and what is delivered is why I now go equipped with a camera and even a crew if I can assemble one and try to report on the event as well as perform (when I am a candidate) at a hustings. Of course this is entirely because it has happened before. My behaviour is totally conditioned by the occasion which sleep brought back to me. I’d somehow excluded it from my thoughts yesterday even though it was the causative event of my current behaviour. You can only know what it is like to do both jobs if you’ve done it. Candidates shouldn’t need to perform as candidates and as reporter. Multiple reasons why not, including obvious bias.\nIt isn’t an accident that I’ve never been elected. For me that is never, has never been the most important thing. A functioning democracy is far more important to me. I was aware when I started my blog things didn’t work properly in Peterborough.\nWell here’s a very important example of things going utterly wrong. If you have an election, voters need to see the candidates as soon as possible so that they can make as good a decision as they possibly can.\nAnything which supports that process is contributing to the workings of democracy. Huge numbers of people not directly involved in the party political processes help the democratic process to work as well as it can. They often don’t get a thank you. The vast majority get absolutely nothing in return. We need more of them and they need to be supported and feel far more empowered.\nAnything or anyone which obstructs that needs to be identified and exposed.\nNobody and nothing should have had the power to murder the livestream on Tuesday. The host of an event is in charge and a candidate at a public event is in a public place. So how was that even possible?\nSo today I’ve decided to stop yelling frantically on twitter, get out the meditative garden fork which is my blog and ask people what they can tell me about these recordings and who stops them being broadcast and why. And if they are used, who uses them. Comments are open if you can talk openly (you can comment anonymously too).

This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY.

To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2018_05_16_3227/content_388.html": "Waste activism in Peterborough has a long and distinguished history and a great many people and many organised groups have got stuck in, many of them heroically and steadily cleaning up things which simply shouldn’t be where they are.\nThis blog years ago as a lament that I had not been able to achieve something I’d dedicated a great deal of time and energy to: stopping the construction of a plant to incinerate domestic waste. And in this blog I began to look at and discuss the politics of Peterborough generally, partly in order to understand and explain the weaknesses of campaigning organisations in the city (who I then felt could all have done better) against a political decision to incinerate, based on levels of (elected councillor) ignorance which I’d never encountered before in any organisation. I needed to understand how that had happened too, and who benefits from a toxic waste disposal policy. Who benefits from a waste policy which isn’t working.\nMeanwhile it seems that the attitudes I encountered: literally: “if you can’t see it, there is nothing there” approach to stack emissions has created a national problem, especially in England, which now does things worse and to lower standards than Scotland, Wales, the USA and Europe. Brexit might offer hope to those that are keen to practice toxic politics, but the toxins left in our environment aren’t going anywhere.\nBut about three years ago the Green Party began a Flash Mob Litter Pick, which roved around in response to resident callouts to deal with litter hotspots. Here’s a Flash Mob after a session litter picking in 2016, taken in a New England cul de sac: Like any litter picker, we were dealing with the council and its ways of doing things, with the odd hazardous item (discarded hypodermic needles are one of the worst at the moment) and we were also thinking about things like the bags the council uses, why people do what they do, where it comes from and how it travelled to where it is. We had hundreds of conversations, with each other, with passers by, with the council and with the people who deal with fly tipped toxic wastes (such as paints, oils, chemicals). It didn’t take us long to appreciate that people were sometimes being turned away by the legal disposal routes because of the way they had been implemented by the council or because of the conversations they had had with council operatives. We encountered a number of people who had been turned away from the Household Waste centre at Dogsthorpe. We realised that if you make people feel they are doing something wrong when they thought they were doing something right (they just didn’t know about the law or the procedure for doing what the council requires them to do) you are probably just building anti-council feelings and even another fly tip. The council operative is probably doing the right thing: saying all the right things, but the person to whom they are talking is struggling to cope with the situation. Some people get angry. Some people are shocked. In this situation, people may hear what is said to them, but they won’t be able to listen. So as we picked, we worked out that if one cul de sac could produce two car boot fulls of waste and a pile of fly tip, then there would be several skips full in each ward in the city. The volume of discarded waste lying around in our environment, defining our environment for everyone living or growing up in it – are unbelievable.\nWith fly tip, we looked at it and we began to understand the impact of the nice man at the front door who offers to take away your rubbish despite not having obtained the all important waste carrier’s licence. The role of this character is key: he (we think it is usually a he!) has perfectly understood the business opportunity provided to him by this corporate communications disaster.\nSometimes it is a whole house contents which is tipped out onto the highway, or someone else’s private property. Anybody in Peterborough can see that there is a big problem with landlords, or with people providing services to landlords and tenants. People living in or running the rental sector grab the cheapest furniture, because tenures are short and incomes are tight and what could be a re-use opportunity is instead a dumped problem. Legitimate house clearance businesses: where are they?\nJulie Howell (pictured here in New England) took the conclusions to Orton Waterville where she was a parish councillor and she applied herself to communicating directly with every resident. Waste management was just one of the things she tackled in her communications. Here she discusses fly tipping on her blog:\nhttp://howell4ortonwaterville.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/getting-grip-on-fly-tipping.html\nAnd here she is discussing fly tip on Radio Cambridgeshire yesterday morning:\nYesterday she was responding to the council leader who made some interesting comments in an article published in the Peterborough Telegraph soon after Julie was elected to the city councillor and thereby displaced the cabinet member responsible for waste management. The paper’s headline and the photograph put fly tipping into the spotlight.\nFirst he announces that fly-tipping will be “a focus” for the council this coming year. And admits that the issue was “repeatedly raised on the doorsteps in the run-up to the elections.” This might suggest that there is hope.\nBut then he says something really interesting. What he appears to do in a scant four lines of text, is give a summary of the results of the Free Bulky Waste Trial. I don’t know if a detailed analysis of the results of the trial has been made available to elected councillors or whether or not that analysis breaks down at ward level. But if not that is what I’d be asking for if I was a councillor.\nHoldich claims that the trial “made no difference to the amount of fly-tipping,” This suggests that the council has a way of very accurately measuring fly tipping activity over a period of time. That would be very interesting, if it were true. I think the police might be interested in how the council knows this too, since not being able to catch fly tippers is one of its defining and most annoying characteristics.\nThen he asserts that “the council missed out on £40,000 from fewer paid collections.” Now, assuming he’s right about that, it suggests to me that the people making use of the free trial were people who would otherwise have called the council to arrange a paid for collection. This group of people, complying with existing procedures and forking out for the collections they organise does not strike me as an appropriate target group if you wanted to attract the waste which is being fly tipped and the people doing the fly tipping, because this group is by Holdich’s definition not fly-tipping their waste anyway. They are doing it correctly and dutifully providing the council with additional revenue.\nThen Holdich claims that “It’s a national problem and nobody has come up with a panacea.” I think by calling on a Greek goddess, he is both looking for and deriding a universal fix. He might do better if he looked systematically at another goddess: Hygeia is the Greek goddess of cleanliness and hygiene, a goddess understood by the Greeks to be part of Aesclepius’ family of medicine, health and feeling good generally.\nBut let’s have a closer look at the council’s “Free Bulky Waste Trial”. It was designed to run for thirteen weeks: from 11th December to 9th March. A bulky waste collection normally costs £23.50. So adding up the available collections during the free trial, we have a cap of 52 collections per day, and an estimated “more than 1,000 free collections” during month one. Then a maximum of 26 per day for the remainder of the trial. Residents would be free to book a collection between 4th December to 5th March. So what actually happened?\nWe don’t know, except that the available slots were taken up enthusiastically to the extent that no more bookings for free collections were taken from 25th January, six weeks before the trial was supposed to end. Taking Christmas into account, the Trial stopped half way through. In fact it didn’t survive the Spring Clean Season. When the council closed new advance bookings, it was clear already that it was well organised people who were using the trial.\nWhat we do know is that if £40,000 revenue was lost to the council because people using the trial would otherwise have booked a chargeable collection, then 1702 free collections were made who’d otherwise pay for those collections. These will have been well organised people complying with procedures, who probably were unlikely to be fly tipping waste or giving it to to a fly tipper masquerading as a legitimate waste handler before the trial began.\nThe big question, then, is how many collections were made above 1702.\n52 per day for the first month would give us four weeks one of which includes the Christmas break. So let’s say 52 x 4 x 3 = 624\nThen we have 26 per day for the other nine weeks, so x 4 x 9 = 936\nIf we add these figures together and take them away from 1702, we get 142.\nRoughly one hundred and forty two collections were available to people who maybe would NOT normally have called the council. And that figure can only be true if the council and those people were able to use every single slot it had available. Given that this target group is likely to be less well organised, less well resourced and generally less compliant with how the council runs things, I find this highly unlikely.\nWe don’t know if the council added capacity, as it promised it would at the outset of the trial if demand was high. And if it didn’t, we don’t know why it didn’t. It may have realised that the non fly tipping community was not engaging very much with its trial, and if so, that would not surprise me.\nI am sure that Holdich feels that the trial proves his point. I dare say it proves mine too: that the systems in place are unfit for purpose for many sections of our community and it is also clear that the ruling Conservatives still have no sensible plan in place to change that.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_chatteris/content_221.html": "Palmer Admits Government has Failed our Area\nJames Palmer is the Conservative candidate expecting to be crowned Mayor of the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on May 4th. Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nFirstly, Peterborough is BIGGER than Cambridge.\nI occasionally make just this point and people look at me as if I was mad. But yes it has been for a while and it still is. I’ve just double checked last census data available on Wikipedia:\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarked gets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn order to make something perfectly clear to your colleagues in a democratic forum it is a legal requirement to declare your interests. It is a criminal offence not to, if it happens to be a pecuniary interest. For some obscure reason, this requirement appears not to have been applied (at least by means of a publicly accessible document) by our Local Enterprise Partnership, until the MP complained. The Register is now available online and forms part of a section on Corporate Governance.\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nMeanwhile I’d love to know what you think.\nAnd if you happen to live in Chatteris or in Wisbech, I hope you vote for Julie too!",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2015_01_01_wind-power-in-peterborough/content_455.html": "I am convinced that the design of wind turbines is still in its infancy. Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:",

I gritted my teeth and started watching, expecting at best a bit of a civic heads up for me. It looked as if it was going to be grim.\nI used to go to the odd police panel (they preceded the introduction of the PCC) and here you can read my previous blogs about the new role of Police and Crime Commissioner and its disastrous roll out in Cambridgeshire (the quality of candidates selected for election by the Conservatives has been terrible). Sitting through meetings (whether they are community based panels or the meet-the-latest-commissioner-in-the-town-hall type) does give you some insight into what issues the police face and how their priorities are decided. So I know exactly why Mr Plod isn’t strolling down my street in his size elevens any more – but unlike many people I don’t have a problem with that.\nBut this docu-drama gives everyone stuck at home and not at all interested in going to meetings a view onto what police work is really like.\nIt turned out to be riveting. I am a huge fan of detective fiction on the telly. Obviously this isn’t fiction: anything but. But the story had me on the edge of my seat and nobody watching it needs to know a single thing about Sherlock, Miss Marple or Morse.\nHats off to everybody who helped put the case together and then: just as remarkable, the story about the investigation. Not easy at all. Well done.

I am particularly interested in what readers think of this system, which I am given to believe was installed by Serco.\nHats off to Chris York, championing transparency and political accountability. I think it is a tribute to Peterborough’s politicians and politicians elsewhere too, not just the elected councillors that making recordings of debates like this has become possible. As far as I am aware it was always legal, but people have been being slung out of public galleries over the past couple of years for recording events.\nFaced with so many challenges, eventually Westminster was forced to make a ruling and councils now have no choice but to give permission. This is the first council meeting I have attended where there was no prohibition notice on the seats in the “Spectators Gallery”.\nThis shows how some of the best interactions happen behind the scenes and outside the chamber.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_election/content_275.html": "Our local paper highlights delays.\nThe appalling project: to dual the A47 between the Wansford roundabout and the Sutton roundabout should be abandoned, especially the section near Wansford, where residents have been led to believe that duelling will prevent queueing in and out of their village during rush hours. This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\n- to accept that there is an unavoidable pinch point at this location\n- to properly repair and maintain the existing road\n- and to put in permanent graduated speed controls which has been proven to improve both flow and safety.\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess.

He was responding to ‘the Mayor‘s review’ or, to give it its full name, ‘The review into Operation Span and the investigation of non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’ which has just been published. The next speaker was Rochdale Council leader Councillor Neil Emmott, the leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, who also apologised for what the council had got wrong.\nNext came three women, each of whom had headed up an organisation working with the thousands of (mostly female and very young) victims of human trafficking and sexual abuse. (nobody’s names came up from start to finish). The first woman had been through the barrier known as the end of one’s tether, her hair got in her way, and she was gasping for air and needed water, but she was clearly a warrior and won my respect for getting out in short order the horrible truths she needed to speak.\nThe second woman was wearing a very smart cream dress and had her hair and make up done: full Manchester female in armour, elegantly equipped equally for the dance floor, lifting someone up out of the gutter, or take her presentation to any board room or civic assembly rooms of the city prepared to listen to what goes on in the darkest corners of the city: where corruption, physical, emotional and psychological abuse and the systemic collusion of letting offenders go: the institutional joint enterprise (how come that is not an offence, she asks?) of deliberately letting known and identified criminals walk free.\nShe struck a line through the whole of the older Oldham predecessor report, revealing that during that investigation, only one victim had been able to speak to the reviewers. It’s people like her I want to see working where they can do what is needed: in the House of Lords.\nThen, just as the third woman, in a dark suit began speaking, she was rudely interrupted by a far more important man: Grant Schapps, talking about the state of the world and threats had multiplied and increased in severity during the horrible reign of his own ghastly Tory Party. I have no idea what the third woman wanted to say.\nHow dare the BBC cut this third woman short? They had three channels they could have used. BBC1, BBC2 and BBCNews. The handling of this press release was outrageous. Instead 10 Downing St was able to shut up a woman speaking on matters of concern to every woman and child and every decent man in the UK.\nI think I might have to complain to the BBC. Three news channels.\nWhat happened to the third woman’s voice, please?\nCan anyone figure out where the broadcast continued?\nWho has broadcast what she said, please?\nMeanwhile, I search for Rochdale report on Youtube and, depressingly, I find:\nThe Nene is in flood, still transporting last summer and autumn’s above average rainfall to the Wash and new steadily heavy El Niño winter rain. Since my third update the Conservative administration at Peterborough City Council has been toppled and a well intentioned but inexperienced ex opposition multi party Cabinet is trying to keep the council’s finances afloat and to fix whatever has been going wrong. The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe notorious collapse of Henry Penn Walk continues, visible to anybody walking over the bridge between Peterborough Town Hall on Bridge Street and the council offices at Sand Martin House. Read my previous updates for the history of this persistently unremedied collapse.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?\nHow to get Santa back when his arrival down your chimney is threatened by UK Government Diktat. Could two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nAll children need to be told about this appalling story broken by Newsthump. Sit them down after they’ve had a good meal and read it as gently and softly as you can. Just before bed with the lights down. Don’t forget right at the end of this absolutely terrible story, to remind them that they are not allowed to vote for a change of government until they turn 18. But they can register to vote to change matters they disapprove of as soon as they turn 17.\nYour children might react by telling you not to be so silly, close their eyes and sleep, much as so often happens when you read one of the ghastliest and grimmest of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nBut if they sit up and protest against your bedtime story, here is how to suggest that they run a poll at their school. Younger doubters may ask for another story: this can’t after all, be how it all ends? Maybe an Adventure is in order? Or a Game? Tomorrow night, then.\nAt their School, Club in the Family or anywhere where there are three or more people who can be persuaded to join in. They will need to appoint an Electoral Returning Officer to run a Poll or even an Internal Election. A boring school would appoint a teacher to this role. But this would avoid about two weeks work for a whole school who could Research, Discuss, Decide and Vote on making their own Elected Officer or Appointment (could be either) from within the class (for a class poll) or a school (for a school wide poll). They’d also need to Decide (and how to do that) whether or not they can Vote in an Assembly (like Parliament) or whether they need a full scale Election, in which case they would need to Design and Manufacture their own Poll Cards, Ballot Boxes and Confidential Polling Booths, Specify the Dates and Times the Booths would be open and then Decide how to Organise the Count: Appoint Polling Staff, Appoint Counting Staff. They’d also have to Decide on the Definition of the Electorate (or determine an Electoral Boundary) and whether or not they need to Register Eligible Voters on an Electoral Register. Oh yes, they’d have to Decide on a Wording to be put on the Ballot and whether or not more than one Vote can be taken and if so, how. And whether or not a Simple Majority is the best Voting Strategy.\nThey could each run a Vote Count to find out who or what Motion has won the Poll. Offences Detected and Offences Not Detected could also be counted, by each of the smaller teams.\nTo make this slightly less deadly (nobody is pretending all this is super exciting!) for older and very bright students, maybe those with lively imaginations and career options including Crime Writer, you could have one small additional group working in a Vote Fraud Team (their Objective could be to Manipulate the Vote by whatever Illegal Means they can Concoct) and another small additional group working as an Electoral Police, working to Detect Electoral Offences. This is not recommended for children under the age of 14, who generally adhere to the Right and Wrong Theory of Everything.\nParticipants who don’t understand the Capitalised Words (there are even a couple in this Post’s Heading!) will find them Defined in Wikipedia.\nCould two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nWell, Arguably they could. Because a teacher who asks a class to Vote FOR or AGAINST an idea by asking for a Show of Hands can run a Poll in about forty seconds flat. Although, of course, that hyper efficient teacher’s class may never grasp the finer points of how elections are run (and policed) by UK governments and UK law enforcement.\nThe monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nBy the morning after the election, it was already clear that the Conservatives were heading for an enormous number of local election defeats. For their Chairman “good” would have been keeping that number to just one thousand. They failed. And lost many more seats than that. The monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nThe result for Park Ward is interesting and in voting in two Conservatives, the ward went clean against the trend in the rest of the UK, which has so far (result in Redcar & Cleveland still to come in) seen the Conservatives net a loss of 1,058 seats.\nIn Park, Conservative candidate Arfan Khan came first and will serve the ward as city councillor for four years.\nConservative Muhammad Asif, on the other hand will serve a term of only one year, since by coming second, he won the seat vacated by ex Councillor Shaz Nawaz when he resigned, and whose term would have expired in 2024.\nMost people I canvassed were very keen not to see the Conservatives take Park. A huge number of people also know that it was a Conservative led council combined with many years of Conservative national governments which have brought the city to its current crisis, a council close to bankruptcy, many residents unable to provide themselves with food or heat indoors and as soon as you step outside the unmistakeable signs of neglect, deprivation and disempowerment are unavoidable.\nA Conservative win therefore baffles many people, including me, frankly. So what happened, how, and why?\nIn Arfan Khan’s case, his vote is a personal one and, I strongly suspect, nothing to do with which party he stood for.\nI can’t speak for or about Muhammad Asif, except to observe that, on the basis of his speech at the Park Ward hustings, he seems agreeable: mild and quietly spoken.\nIn Park Ward, the resignation of the Labour Group Leader, ex Councillor Nawaz and the last minute resignation of ex Councillor Ikra Yasin prior to the elections will inevitably have damaged Labour’s chances in the ward, necessitating as they did, a last minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign. It is possible that the degree of Labour Party turbulence in Peterborough and especially in Park Ward is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Conventional wisdom would suggest that by this stage in the parliamentary electoral cycle, and with the current disgrace-inclined government, Labour should be able to wipe the board. Its supporters are angry that it isn’t taking opportunities when they are available. Labour could have taken control of Peterborough City Council, had it been allowed to work with other opposition councillors. As it is, Labour remains the hardest party to work with for the Greens (not just here), however helpful individual councillors might be.\nSo far, so good: these elements may be more or less peculiar to Park Ward. But I think most of the residents of the ward – and beyond – will still be bewildered that the Conservatives now hold two of the three city council seats representing residents in the ward. This is very clear in comments on Facebook.\nBut the turmoil in Labour is worth returning to, since it has affected Peterborough’s Green election campaigns beyond Park Ward – and beyond Peterborough – too.\nPeterborough Greens (in common with Greens elsewhere in the country) have benefitted this year by the defections from Labour to our party of two excellent councillors. Bright Green published an article about this phenomenon. Unfortunately only one of ours (Cllr Heather Skibstead) succeeded in retaining her seat in Peterborough (which was Orton Longueville): she had more months and more of her own free time in which to communicate in advance of the election with her ward’s residents. However, her success represents a national first for the Green Party and we here as well as the party at large are delighted and very proud of this achievement.\nIt is really important for a political party to be able to manage post defection retention elections well. I’d like the Green Party to be a good place for good hard working conscientious councillors who’d much rather be with us, to defect to. Lots of councillors hang on in a political party they don’t really like, putting up with things they despise only because they know that being on your own and going independent is so risky. It makes sense that we work together to make it less risky to transfer a prior party allegiance to the Green Party. If you are reading this and are considering making such a step: please talk to us confidentially well in advance.\nOddly, Heather’s retaining her seat counts as a GAIN for the Greens (even though as far as we were concerned, she was already a Green Party councillor), because the press compares the results of this with those of the previous election, which is guaranteed to confuse anyone not following things at this level of detail.\nThe second defector to our ranks this year was ex Cllr Imtiaz Ali. His arrival resulted in our biggest yet Green group of four on the council and I am sorry for him as well as for the group that he didn’t retain his Fletton & Woodston seat in this election. It would have been nearly if not impossible to win it, given the very short timescale available to his campaign.\nOnce again, despite losing Cllr Imtiaz Ali from our Green group on the council, Greens in Peterborough are reported in the media as having gained one councillor for the same confusing reasons. So despite gaining one, this picture on the council’s website on the day of the election, will soon reduce down to three councillors.\nBeyond all this excitement and a little further away in Orton Waterville, Councillor Nicola Day campaigned calmly and steadily to retain her seat and her campaign’s approach was rewarded with a huge margin of success, helping to entrench Orton Waterville’s reputation locally as an exceptionally well represented and very-happy-to-be-Green ward.\nThis campaign has been truly extraordinary.\nThe achievement of Cllr Kirsty Knight in supporting members of another party getting used to Green ways of working cannot be overstated. This (as with many of her other roles) is not easy. Thank you Kirsty.\nIn this election our campaign teams have attempted more than ever before. Thank you for your votes. I have never received so many messages of support. I have never worked alongside so many volunteers and helpers. Our councillor team and our election team are quite simply, awesome. The reception candidates have received on doorsteps has been amazing and I feel that voters in Peterborough get us, at last. What we are, what we do, how we do it, and what we are capable of is just beginning to be understood. We are beginning to be seen, rather than described by outside hostile voices. The objectives we set ourselves are difficult and it is even more difficult to take people with us on these journeys, but I for one no longer feel I am on my own: there are people I have never met personally coming along beside me, who see me immediately they open their front door. I’d like to thank everyone who has appreciated us and lent us a hand during this campaign. We could not have achieved a fraction of what we have without such magnificent commitment and support. I hope you have enjoyed it and got something out of it as well. Thank you.\nreaders of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might explain the late declaration.\nThursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late. As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph. (Please note that the second and fourth articles have subsequently been updated.)\nThe third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am.\nAs a candidate, my job on election night is to wait for the ballot box to come in and to be present at the count. This is how candidates respect the voter’s voice. The ballot box contains the ballots and on their ballot papers are the choices of voters, speaking and expressing their wishes on the one day they are allowed to vote. Candidates observe their counts. We see what they say.\nThe first of Park Ward’s ballot boxes (Madeley House polling station) came in in reasonable time. The second ballot box (All Saints polling station) came in very late indeed, apparently owing to a long queue building up due to the Photo ID check. Queue tickets were issued to those in the queue at 10pm. This was clearly not expected to be a big thing by polling staff, who, when I left them had already been on duty for thirteen and a half hours, with only on-site breaks. The third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am. I do not know how long polling staff had been at their posts by the time they were discharged from their duties, nor in what state they were. Polling staff are not permitted to leave the polling station while they are on duty and although they are all prepared for a 15 -16 hour shift, which is already an outrageously long working day, they certainly do not expect to be on duty very much beyond 10pm. I am wondering how many polling staff had to endure a 20 hour working day extending beyond Thursday 4th May into the early hours of the 5th.\nIt is true that PhotoID was trialled. But the very small trials were failures.\nUK government implemented the legislation despite the pilots’ failures.\nBallot boxes are normally handed over to the transport soon after 10pm and will usually arrive about an hour later. This year Peterborough City Council could not afford huge numbers of high security transit vehicles (the trucks looked like refrigerated container trucks) so some polling station staff at the eighty polling stations open at this year’s local election (there will be more polling stations for next year’s elections) will have had to wait for one of the five trucks waiting for a hold up somewhere else. I do not know how many polling stations were impacted by delays occurring in Park Ward. Nor do I know if other wards were themselves affected by late long queues.\nI cannot physically be in two places at once and all my team was already with me at the Town Hall. So, what I want to know is exactly what happened at the All Saints and St Georges polling stations. The advice I was given by polling staff was that the dinner time rush which usually starts between 5pm and 6pm was already dying down. Something clearly changed from the ward’s normal voting behaviour. How come? Why did such long queues form so late in the voting window?\nWere you in one of the queues? Please describe what happened.\nYou can comment below, or you can contact me privately.\nBBC Cambridgeshire hosts election debate to be broadcast at 10:00 this morning.\nTo be broadcast at 10:00 this morning.

Go West! Leader of the Peterborough City Council, Wayne Fitzgerald, (featured in still my most popular post) has responded to Camcycle’s 2023 local election survey about active travel.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nActive Travel is a government department\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.\nPostal ballots began to land on doormats only two days ago\nI’ve been standing at a great many front doors, ready to introduce myself when suddenly this week, there was no need: “Ah, so you’re Fiona.

And a massive black cloud did come along and snowed on us and one very delighted little girl. Hail followed. But we stayed warm (oddly, it wasn’t all that cold). And we kept posting leaflets into letterboxes. But it was one of those days when focussing on broken bins and flytipped furniture and electrics was particularly difficult. The ghastly truth is that people (including me) get used to rubbish in their environment and we literally have no choice but to keep moving: to pass it by. We’d never do anything if we dealt with every bit. But sometimes the weather and the lovely stuff steals the show and that is what this afternoon was like. So here’s a photo narrative. The moon was in at least three photos, but now I can only find it in one.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_efw/content_344.html": "A meeting of a committee with a very long name: Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee held on Wednesday 13th June, 2012 at 7.00 pm Bourges Viersen Room, Town Hall. may turn out to be the last committee able to interrogate or discuss Peterborough City Council’s plans to build an incinerator, a so-called “Energy from Waste (EfW) plant” before an executive decision is taken by the deputy leader in consultation with the Waste 2020 Project Board (whose recommendations and minutes I believe are not published – please put a link in a comment if you find them!). If this committee does not “call-in” the decision the council is expected to proceed with incineration plans which still can’t be examined by the public.\nDocuments showing council’s current thinking and a brief history of its proposal for an EfW plant has been circulated to councillors. These documents reveal that fears which have often been expressed about the city’s recycling (how it does it and how much it does) and even bigger worries about incineration replacing recycling could well be justified.\nThe EfW plant was discussed at ITEM 5. Waste 2020 Programme- Energy from Waste Facility And Other Associated Works and Services Part of the discussion was to be “exempt”. The agenda item reads as follows, although the highlighting is mine:\n“In accordance with Standing Orders, Members are asked to determine whether the update report to be tabled at the meeting relating to agenda item 5. Waste 2020 Programme – Energy From Waste Facility which contains exempt appendices containing information relating to the financial or business affairs of a particular person (including the authority holding that information), as defined by Paragraph 3 of Schedule 12A of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1972, should be exempt and the press and public excluded from the meeting when these appendices are discussed or whether the public interest in disclosing this information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.”\nI asked from the public seating area that members be given the opportunity to vote on excluding members of the public because the chair seemed to be telling us to leave at the outset of ITEM 5 and without any vote. They were then allowed to vote. The chair also had to be persuaded by council officers that part of ITEM 5 could be discussed in public and that the exclusion could follow discussion of that part rather than apply to the whole item.\nHowever no discussion took place in this committee on the relative merits of the “public interest in disclosing” as opposed to the “public interest in maintaining the exemption” and it was not clear to me that members of the committee understood that standing orders provided them with an opportunity to debate the relative pros and cons of sharing the information with the public. The chair of the committee refused to let me raise this.\nThe public interest in disclosing is overwhelming in my view. I believe that this committee was led by its chair into a breach of its own standing orders by not having any debate about where the balance of public interest lay: whether it was better for the city to have disclosure or not. Members of the committee were simply not asked to contribute their thoughts on the subject or debate it before they were asked to vote.\nFor some members of the newly formed opposition (Independent/Labour) this was their first time sitting on this committee. I don’t know how they felt but I was in a state of mild shock by the time we were thrown out.\nPeterborough City Council’s call-in procedure\nrequires two members of a scrutiny committee to complete a form explaining the reasons for a call-in (eg failure to follow due process).

Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarkedgets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_05_09_my-bank-holiday-and-a-filthy-fire-two-days-later/content_458.html": "On Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf\nI don’t suppose there was any calculation involved: I doubt there was any thought whatsoever, beyond saving the expense of a trip to the Householders’ Waste dump. I genuinely don’t think people know about dioxins, thalates, cyanides, PCBs, chlorines, fluorines…. http://plasticisrubbish.wordpress.com/2008/06/02/dioxins-why-you-dont-want-to-be-burning-plastic/ ……and that is just the plastics. What about paint? Dyes? Nylons? Foams? Fibres? Metals …………..\nThey don’t know because nobody is telling them. The ET could run a shock horror story on this any time it wanted. The penalties in law are fines of up to £20,000, so it would be only fair to warn people. People should know about the law and the possible fines as well as about the hideous dangers presented by burning complex synthetic substances.\nYou have a point about my option to call a councillor: but my objective is not to achieve an “ET story” or “waves”. What I want to achieve is a working out of hours toxic fire procedure available to any resident in my local authority area. Wow: that’s a mouthful. I tried once to achieve this and failed, and am now having another go.\nGetting a single fire dealt with does not achieve this. Nor does a newspaper story.\nLikeLike\nYou mean you want a complete solution, not a partial one?\nGood luck.\nI fear, however, you may find yourself waiting a long time.\nLikeLike\nWell done for some dogged sleuthing. And rightly so – that fire sounds calculated to offend.\nOne question for you. No surprise that a council officer should have been hard to raise, but why didn’t you hassle a councillor instead?\nThey have the virtue of being easily contactable, there’s a good chance they’d make waves on the Tuesday morning, and there’s a good pick – with three local members to choose form plus key figures on the relevant committee(s).\nAnd bonus – had a councillor turned up, you’d have had the makings of an ET story.\nLikeLike",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_author_fionaradic_page_10/content_753.html": "@SustransPBoro and Peterborough Cycling Forum members gathered this week to protest against the proposal (announced in the council’s budget) to demolish Rhubarb Bridge. Follow Sustrans Peterborough on facebook. A member of the Werrington Running Club explained that the running club members use the bridge. While we were there the bridge was never empty: children were making their way to school: many pupils at Voyager school will get to school via this bridge and commuters were cycling and walking over it.\nOn top of the bridge, it ducks under the A47: the path descends a bit, making it an up and under bridge. It is an extraordinary design and in its day was very innovative. It is difficult to envisage a better design, given the continuous roar of traffic along the A47 crosses the Lincoln Road here: the main trunk route north out of Peterborough. Rhubarb Bridge (apparently so called because rhubarb kept coming up on its embankments when it was newly built) allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross two major roads on a set of off road, fully segregated paths, ramps and steps. There is absolutely no conflict with road traffic, which as things are, only stops for more road traffic.\nThe only road user who is not catered for, is (possibly) someone using a wheelchair or mobility scooter. There are ramps and they are certainly no steeper than many hills, but on the morning of our photoshoot, I did not see anyone attempt them in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter (which are very popular in Peterborough).\nUpdate 2: The two men who died between Yaxley and Farcet\nMy blog was partly about the alienating effect of cars and our road infrastructure and understanding why car parks and bridges over roads are chosen by suicidal (women, most often). As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\nMy January 2015 post received quite a bit of feedback and I realised that I was wrong about what the remedy is. Or at any rate that what I believed I meant was capable of being misunderstood. So, I don’t believe that the city needs a Clerk of Works any more. I believe that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works. I didn’t update my blog at the time (I often don’t) but now that the issue of budgets and management of major infrastructure projects at Peterborough City Council will be making headlines again, I am correcting my recommended solution so as to make absolutely clear to decision makers what I believe Peterborough needs.\nI learned last year that technically – i.e. on paper, legally, contractually and presumably somewhere in its accounts spreadsheet the council can actually claim to “have” a Clerk of Works. But also that (astonishingly) that function is currently performed by an employee or employees of the contractor doing the job and is not necessarily even a single nameable person. It may be “contractually normal” to organise a clerk of works function like this: I am told it is. But to my mind it is a notion, provided in the contract, but where it sits in any practical sense and who performs the function and why these persons unknown’s first loyalty should be our council and how the council can hold them accountable (for example by sacking them) is all shrouded in mystery. So a Clerk of Works is effectively useless: like a button floating free of the shirt, as it were.\nI believe now that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works who must be a member of Peterborough City Council’s staff, on their payroll and their payroll only and 100% and solely accountable to Peterborough City Council. I believe that role should be filled by a highly qualified person (i.e., they might have at least one civil engineering degree). They should be paid a professional and competitive salary and that the job should be advertised publicly and include local advertisements and the appointment process should be open to scrutiny within the council’s audit and compliance procedures.\nThe In House Clerk of Works I envisage would be supported by a planning department within the city council with immediate access to council archives and records. It is not good enough for planning staff to be located in one place and the documents in another. It is very difficult for members of the public to cope with the current system. How members of staff cope with using it on a daily basis beats me. I remain suspicious about how the Fletton Parkway contaminated land managed to come as a surprise to the Fletton Parkway Widening Project team:\nThe In House Clerk of Works should be empowered to scrutinise and halt any and all jobs done for the council at any stage in the application, approval and completion processes and to withhold sign off and payment until all the council’s quality standards are met. I hate seeing money being spent on works which are shoddy and unpleasing to the eye and hearing about decisions which nobody realised were as bad as they were at the time.* It does nothing for our local environments, which we pay good money to empower our councils to improve. And it does even less for our self respect as a city.\nIncidentally, taking down a wood or removing a green space is not a neutral act. In an Environment City you’d expect it to be considered especially controversial. But in addition to basic ecological concerns, woodland has long been used to conceal problems with the soil. Where you can’t grow a crop, farmers and landowners will often grow trees which will perform all sorts of useful functions within a landscape. Perhaps the cost of removing these particular patches of woodland and scrub will teach Peterborough to respect its green spaces and what they are actually doing a little more? We are often told by people who don’t realise we depend upon it and that we live in it that we “can’t afford” the environment. Perhaps this wacky but all too widespread reasoning informed the decision to widen Fletton Parkway? But in the city with the highest dependency on cars, it is likely that a £6M overspend (on top of what was originally budgeted) will be seen as “unavoidable” and “necessary”, because building a bigger road network remains at the uncontested top of Peterborough’s spending priorities.\n*For example:\nthe decision to turn one third of the A1139 parkway lights off and damaging whole lengths of under road cabling in the process, leaving a lethal bright stretch followed by a dark stretch, a bright stretch and another dark stretch. This light and dark lighting phenomenon (particularly noticeable near Stanground) happened all around the city because decision makers failed to check with the relevant qualified electrician what the impact of removing those particular light bulbs would be. In order to put it right all the affected lengths of road would have to be dug up.\nReturning for her second lunchtime performance at St John’s this month, pianist Irena Radić is joined by violinist Freya Goldmark in a concert of some of the finest music for violin and piano written by French composers. The highlight will be a performance of Franck’s thrilling Sonata in A Major, but we’ll also hear works by composers such as Debussy and Lili Boulanger.\nAs usual the café will be open from noon, serving a range of hot drinks and homemade cakes, scones etc. All profits from the café will go to The Green Backyard.\nThe concert will begin promptly at 1pm. Admission is free, but those who are able to afford it are asked to make a donation. The suggested amount is £4.\nAbout Freya:\nFreya Goldmark has performed extensively in the UK, not least at Sandringham in front of Prince Charles, in Europe (including Russia, and live on Norwegian…\nFlute Concert at 1pm at St John The Baptist in Cathedral Square, Peterborough\nThis concert is the third in a summer concert series organised by St Johns CIC. Hannah Clark will be joined by Irena Radić. Both of these young musicians have given concerts at St John’s before. In their début appearance here together Hannah Clark (flute) and Irena Radić (piano) will play music by Fauré, Ravel, Reinecke, and more…\nThe church will be open from about midday and arriving early ensures time for a homemade cake or a coffee. All profits go to The Green Backyard.\nThe concert will begin promptly at 1pm. Admission is free, but those who are able to afford it are asked to make a donation. The suggested amount is £4.\nYou can also spend some time with the magnificent textile work, Mapestry, installed in St John’s as part of this year’s magnificent PECT Green Festival. Mapestry will be in the church for a short while, and then it will tour the route of the River Nene which passes through the city. The work consists of twelve delightfully characterful panels, each one describing a month in the year and a place on the Nene. The work has been created by Froglife a major wildlife charity based in Peterborough and a number of community crafters. Nenescape is a Heritage Lottery funded Landscape Partnership Scheme conserving and protecting the Nene Valley’s natural and built history. Get in touch with them if you think you can help. A woman in a red dress is walking her dog in Ferry Meadows:\n“Peterborough needs The Broadway Theatre, it does not need more flats. Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.\nWhile out I learned that the police or the government (depending which story you read) were investigating a possible fraud to do with the people who had signed the petition: some of whom didn’t live in the UK and some of whom were apparently surplus to the entire populations of whole countries, so presumably might consist only of an email address. 77,000 false signatures had apparently been removed. Variations on this tale are numerous but you have to go to twitter for a laugh.\nIncidentally isn’t it wonderful that a Leave petition is being so enthusiastically embraced by the Remain side? Perhaps the petitions office should have let the No Confidence in David Cameron petition get a debate? Looking back, it might have been an easier way for him to leave office and the office might not have been left in quite such an appalling mess.\nA petition launched apparently launched three weeks before Thursday’s decision of the UK electorate to Leave the EU has garnered over three million signatures since Thursday as I write at half past ten on Sunday morning.\nSomeone asked me:\n“I have 5 friends sharing this. The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\na statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\na statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\nthe revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\nthe loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\nthe loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\nthe exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\nthe exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\nthe exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\nthe possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\nthe likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\nno plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\nthe awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\nLeave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\nLeave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\nthe growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_06_20_scrutiny-committee-doesnt-ask/content_661.html": "A meeting of a committee with a very long name: Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee held on Wednesday 13th June, 2012 at 7.00 pm Bourges Viersen Room, Town Hall. may turn out to be the last committee able to interrogate or discuss Peterborough City Council’s plans to build an incinerator, a so-called “Energy from Waste (EfW) plant” before an executive decision is taken by the deputy leader in consultation with the Waste 2020 Project Board (whose recommendations and minutes I believe are not published – please put a link in a comment if you find them!). If this committee does not “call-in” the decision the council is expected to proceed with incineration plans which still can’t be examined by the public.\nDocuments showing council’s current thinking and a brief history of its proposal for an EfW plant has been circulated to councillors. These documents reveal that fears which have often been expressed about the city’s recycling (how it does it and how much it does) and even bigger worries about incineration replacing recycling could well be justified.\nThe EfW plant was discussed at ITEM 5. Waste 2020 Programme- Energy from Waste Facility And Other Associated Works and Services Part of the discussion was to be “exempt”. The agenda item reads as follows, although the highlighting is mine:\n“In accordance with Standing Orders, Members are asked to determine whether the update report to be tabled at the meeting relating to agenda item 5. Waste 2020 Programme – Energy From Waste Facility which contains exempt appendices containing information relating to the financial or business affairs of a particular person (including the authority holding that information), as defined by Paragraph 3 of Schedule 12A of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1972, should be exempt and the press and public excluded from the meeting when these appendices are discussed or whether the public interest in disclosing this information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.”\nI asked from the public seating area that members be given the opportunity to vote on excluding members of the public because the chair seemed to be telling us to leave at the outset of ITEM 5 and without any vote. They were then allowed to vote. The chair also had to be persuaded by council officers that part of ITEM 5 could be discussed in public and that the exclusion could follow discussion of that part rather than apply to the whole item.\nHowever no discussion took place in this committee on the relative merits of the “public interest in disclosing” as opposed to the “public interest in maintaining the exemption” and it was not clear to me that members of the committee understood that standing orders provided them with an opportunity to debate the relative pros and cons of sharing the information with the public. The chair of the committee refused to let me raise this.\nThe public interest in disclosing is overwhelming in my view. I believe that this committee was led by its chair into a breach of its own standing orders by not having any debate about where the balance of public interest lay: whether it was better for the city to have disclosure or not. Members of the committee were simply not asked to contribute their thoughts on the subject or debate it before they were asked to vote.\nFor some members of the newly formed opposition (Independent/Labour) this was their first time sitting on this committee. I don’t know how they felt but I was in a state of mild shock by the time we were thrown out.\nPeterborough City Council’s call-in procedure\nrequires two members of a scrutiny committee to complete a form explaining the reasons for a call-in (eg failure to follow due process). The affected committee (the one within whose remit the decision takes place) then has to meet within 10 days to uphold the call-in or recommend action.\nOther councils’ procedures: Hackney Hertsmere Laudably, Thurrock Council provides for both its elected Members and the public to call-in these decisions prior to implementation.\nPeterborough has “suspended” its own call-in procedure on four occasions in 2005\nOne thought on “Scrutiny committee doesn’t ask if disclosure could be in the public interest”",

Ed claims the award has a dating problem and could therefore have been made ultra vires.\nI was so stunned by the way this was handled by the new mayor (legal advice or comment was not even sought) that I missed the exact words of the dismissal, but it was dismissed in about four words. Could have been “You can’t have that.” Over so quickly.\nBasically from the Spectators Gallery our council appeared not interested last night in defending itself in public against a charge it may have acted “beyond its powers”, i.e. unconstitutionally. Not only that, but on one of the most politically contentious areas of its responsibility: executive pay being a marker for escalating levels of inequality in society and in our organisations.\nWhereas various councillors sprang to support Harrington’s dismissed second motion (which by then was history), not a single councillor supported Ed Murphy’s assertion (either properly at the time or subsequently by way of solidarity or rhetorical effect – both options being wide open to them).\nIt seems to me that there are at least three possible explanations:\nThis event (originally blogged here on 1st May) has not happened yet. Jack Ginns came to talk to Peterborough in Transition on Monday evening and explained how sustainability was central to his enthusiasm for engineering and for transport and he discussed the history of Railworld in Peterborough and the Reverend Richard Paten’s conception of a centre for sustainable transport and lifestyles on the Railworld site.\nIt turned out that the initial idea Jack had had for a meeting about sustainability had grown into an all day event and that he was considering maybe splitting the themes into more, smaller events. So if you’d like to register your interest at what is still a future event or a series of future events, please send Jack your email address and he will add you to his mailing list.\nThe King’s School Peterborough was founded by King Henry VIII in 1541 and as the city’s Cathedral School students have been singing and playing instruments within its walls ever since. And not just within its walls, because their musical activites take young performers all over the UK and far beyond. But this is a wonderful opportunity to hear Kings’ musicians strut their stuff in St Johns, the city’s oldest parish church (and currently one of its liveliest!).\nLast night I arrived at Council too late to catch the whole debate on the council’s plan to make a £1.2M annual saving by cutting the services it currently provides to Peterborough’s children.\nBut I was in time for the recorded vote. Our local newspaper has already published this story but has not (so far) provided a list of who voted which way. I suppose this information will eventually be published in the council’s very own minutes, but who ever reads those?\nSo, since several people have asked for a breakdown, here are my gleanings from the Spectators Gallery:\nCON Arculus, Nick ABSTAIN West\nCON Casey, Graham ABSTAIN Orton Longueville\nCON Lee, Matthew ABSTAIN Fletton\nCON Maqbool, Yasmeen ABSTAIN West\nCON Simons, George ABSTAIN Paston\nCON Sanders, David name heard but unable to hear response Eye & Thorney\nCON Allen, Sue name not heard Orton Waterville\nCON Cereste Marco name not heard Stanground Central\nCON McKean, Dale name not heard Eye & Thorney\nCON Walsh, Irene name not heard Stanground Central\nCON Dalton, Matthew NOT VOTING West\nCON Day, Sue NOT VOTING Paston\nCON Elsey, Gavin NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Fitzgerald, Wayne NOT VOTING Bretton North\nCON Goodwin, Janet NOT VOTING Orton Longueville\nCON Harper, Chris NOT VOTING Stanground East\nCON Hiller, Peter NOT VOTING Northborough\nCON Holdich, John (OBE) NOT VOTING Ghinton & Wittering\nCON Kreling, Pam NOT VOTING Park\nCON Lamb, Diane NOT VOTING Glinton & Wittering\nCON Nadeem, Mohammed NOT VOTING Central\nCON Nawaz, Gul NOT VOTING Ravensthorpe\nCON North, Nigel NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Peach, John NOT VOTING Park\nCON Rush, Brian NOT VOTING Stanground Central\nCON Scott, Sheila NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Seaton, David NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Serluca, Lucia NOT VOTING Fletton\nCON Stokes, June NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Thacker, Paula NOT VOTING Werrington South\nCON Todd, Marion NOT VOTING East\nCON Over, David NOT VOTING Barnack\nLAB Forbes, Lisa FOR Orton Longueville\nLAB Jamil, Mohammed FOR Central\nLAB Johnson, Jo FOR East\nLAB Khan, Nazim (MBE) FOR Central\nLAB Knowles, John FOR Paston\nLAB Martin, Stuart FOR Bretton North\nLAB Shabbir, Nabil FOR East\nLAB Shearman, John FOR Park\nLAB Thulbourn, Nick FOR Fletton & Woodston\nLAB Murphy, Ed FOR Ravensthorpe\nLAB Sylvester, Ann FOR Bretton North\nLD Fower, Darren FOR Werrington South\nLD Sandford, Nick FOR Walton\nLD Shaheed, Asif FOR Walton\nLD Davidson, Julia name heard but unable to hear response Werrington South\nPIF Miners, Adrian declared interest, so unable to vote Dogsthorpe\nPIF Ash, Christopher FOR Dogsthorpe PIF Fletcher, Michael FOR Bretton South\nPIF Fox, John FOR Werrington North\nPIF Fox, Judith FOR Werrington North\nPIF Harrington, David FOR Newborough\nPIF Saltmarsh, Christabel FOR Dogsthorpe\nPIF Sharp, Keith FOR North\nPIF Swift, Charles (OBE) FOR “but confused” North\nPIF Lane, Stephen name not heard Werrington North\nI found it very difficult indeed to pick up the voices of the Conservative councillors last night. It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.\nI happily accepted an invitation to join a “participating audience” tonight and gave away my ticket for the James Galway concert in Ely Cathedral.\nI turned up at the Copeland Community Centre to listen to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) challenge the solar voltaic project planned for Newborough and which has been vocally and enthusiastically led by Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative), Leader of Peterborough City Council (Conservative) who believes it presents the answer to what he (Conservative) describes as “the black hole” created by the ConDem (but mainly Conservative) government of which Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) is an elected representative. They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment.

I wanted to ask him:\nWhether or not public authorities (including Peterborough City Council) don’t have to disclose to our elected representative in parliament whatever information is requested of them and to confirm that he does actually have all the figures because he has asked the city council for them and they have been obliged to disclose them.\nThe Green Backyard and Metal welcome Robin Grey and Laura Burns to present an incredible evening of stories, song, sustenance and struggle as we delve into the history of the land beneath your feet.\nJoin us to explore the often forgotten past of enclosure, privatisation and dispossession of land-based communities, and hear the vibrant histories of struggle and resistance that emerged when people rose up and confronted the loss of their lands, cultures and ways of life.\nThese multiple histories go largely undocumented in the literature of the times, yet in the music and stories of the people they take on a different life.

Venues for Hustings – for Candidates 2015\nPeterborough’s best hustings are often held in churches or schools. These can be public or closed events. Hustings they can be held anywhere and by any organisation. A school event is particularly interesting: because children often see politics as something which only happens on the television or on the radio. You are never too young to vote. You are never too young to debate a issue.\nThe person hosting the hustings will probably need a candidate to apply for one of these venues. The legislation (statute) governing this provision is the Representation of the People Act.\nThis hustings will happen later this week and there are rules (below the picture) about how to ask a question. The organisation of the hustings is up to the host.\nI have never attended a hustings which got out of hand (close, but the well behaved sixth formers and their teachers worked hard to persuade candidates perhaps not to resort to fisticuffs). A calm, friendly and firm person in the chair will help ensure a hustings keeps its hair on. However the history of violence and intimidation within and working against the British democratic process is substantial and centuries old. This is well understood by parliament itself. So to help keep things peaceful and calm, legislation makes a police presence available to hustings organisers if they feel they need one. A very important, but perhaps not well understood statutory duty of the police is to uphold the democratic process, of which the hustings form a very important important part.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2014_05_15_a-visit-to-ramsey-foodbank/content_431.html": "RAMSEY FOODBANK SHOWS ME WHAT IT DOES\nLast week I visited Cambridgeshire’s newest foodbank, which opened a year ago in Ramsey. This visit formed one of a number of visits to the region’s growing number of food banks by members of the European Green Team in the run up to the European elections on 22nd May. Our team has reported on Hunger in the East.\nThe Ramsey foodbank is based at St Thomas a Becket on Ramsey High Street and it works as part of the network of Trussell Trust foodbanks which now serve no fewer than fourteen communities throughout Cambridgeshire.\n“I arrived with me lots of grand ideas and optimism. Less than a week before my visit I had been at the opening of a new food cooperative in Peterborough which has huge ambitions to change the way we shop and eat in the city. I am talking to growers and makers and I am often around people who jar and pot things.\n“When I arrived in Ramsey the market town sitting in an area of rich arable land was particularly green and beautiful, and lush with recent rain. The harsh realities of hunger in an area which is so very rich agriculturally brought me down to earth and made me think.”\nWHY EMPTY KITCHEN CUPBOARDS IN RAMSEY?\nRev’d Gita Bond, who manages the Ramsey project explained that “The foodbank provides an emergency food supply for people without an income or on an income so low that they cannot afford food. Its clientele is identified by one of a dozen different agencies as in need of emergency food. They are issued with a voucher.”\nThe food bank relies on ongoing donations from parishioners and residents and it is also on the lookout for people who can deliver donations to people who are not mobile or who live further away.\nGita didn’t need to explain about the tea and biscuit which awaits volunteers: a group of people were talking and organising all manner of things around a busy and welcoming table. The church works with a wide range of community groups and there is a warm welcome for everybody.\nFoodbanks have proliferated because successive governments have failed and failed and failed again to tackle poverty wages.\nThe costs of living rise and people in work find their pay stands still and it is impossible to pay all the bills and put food on the table. People earning poverty pay are a growing part of those turning to food banks for help.\nPeople not in work for various reasons are more obviously vulnerable to hunger. But they are also victims of ideologically motivated and regressive government decisions.\nThe Green Party disapproves very strongly of the Department of Work and Pensions’ “sanctions” regime, which literally removes the welfare safety net from vulnerable claimants. Although a sanction can later be removed, a hunger gap opens up immediately. If the person falling into that hunger gap is lucky, they might get help from the foodbank.\n“Worries have recently been expressed to me that employees in the DWP may be being prevented by their line managers from identifying and referring people who need food immediately.”\n“We need an immediate change in government policy. Policy has gone back to before the second world war: we had malnutrition then and it is shameful that it has come back.\n“And on the ground, regardless of who gets elected on 22nd May, we need to figure out how we can improve our food resilience.\n“I was both impressed and horrified. I could see that almost all the food in the store is processed and packaged and it needs to be like that in order to have a reasonably long shelf life. Consequently there is nothing fresh at all. If someone donates something with a source of protein in it, such as a tin of fish or meatballs it can be issued. But if what is received is nutritionally unbalanced or poor, or all if all the donations are pasta, then that is all the foodbank can issue.\n“I suspect that what happens is that someone steps in: I bet it is someone with very limited means themselves, but it will be someone who cares. Communities work like this: but it is awful that they have to. But I am so very impressed with what they do manage to achieve despite the problems.\n“What I simply don’t understand is why we accept this system. Isn’t it insane for a country as wealthy as ours to function in this miserable way?\nCALL TO RETAIL CHAINS TO HELP\nThe Green Party is urging retail chains with outlets in the Ramsey area to make small regular donations of suitable items. A list is available from the foodbank.\n“But beyond these immediate calls for help, we are urging food processors to identify and minimise food waste. I sometimes hear about large amounts of perfectly edible food being dumped in Cambridgeshire: some of it destined for landfill (because it has been packaged and it is not worth unpacking it). Some of it goes for composting. In fact I heard a little while ago that on a farm close to Ramsey supermarket reject tomatoes were being composted. They might be the wrong colour or shape. This is not sustainable: this is not right.\n“It is high time we got this edible fresh food quickly to people who want and need good quality local food. I am perfectly happy to go and talk to a producer or a shop myself about what goes wrong in our broken food systems and how we can work to tackle hunger. I think the co-existence of food waste and hunger demonstrates that the food economy is not working efficiently. This is not good for consumers, but it doesn’t do any good to local farmers or food producers either.\nI blog often and I truly thank you for your content.\nThis great article has really peaked my interest. I am\ngoing to bookmark your blog and keep checking for new information about once a week.\nI subscribed to your RSS feed too.\nLikeLike\nThank you so much! Sorry for the big delay in responding. I needed to sit down and figure out what on earth happened to the dashboard.\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough-city-council_page_10/content_649.html": "Last night full council refused to discuss the executive pay award which Cllr Ed Murphy (LAB) raised as a comment on the minutes. Ed claims the award has a dating problem and could therefore have been made ultra vires.\nI was so stunned by the way this was handled by the new mayor (legal advice or comment was not even sought) that I missed the exact words of the dismissal, but it was dismissed in about four words. Could have been “You can’t have that.” Over so quickly.\nBasically from the Spectators Gallery our council appeared not interested last night in defending itself in public against a charge it may have acted “beyond its powers”, i.e. unconstitutionally. Not only that, but on one of the most politically contentious areas of its responsibility: executive pay being a marker for escalating levels of inequality in society and in our organisations.\nWhereas various councillors sprang to support Harrington’s dismissed second motion (which by then was history), not a single councillor supported Ed Murphy’s assertion (either properly at the time or subsequently by way of solidarity or rhetorical effect – both options being wide open to them).\nIt seems to me that there are at least three possible explanations:\nLast night I arrived at Council too late to catch the whole debate on the council’s plan to make a £1.2M annual saving by cutting the services it currently provides to Peterborough’s children.\nBut I was in time for the recorded vote. Our local newspaper has already published this story but has not (so far) provided a list of who voted which way. I suppose this information will eventually be published in the council’s very own minutes, but who ever reads those?\nSo, since several people have asked for a breakdown, here are my gleanings from the Spectators Gallery:\nCON Arculus, Nick ABSTAIN West\nCON Casey, Graham ABSTAIN Orton Longueville\nCON Lee, Matthew ABSTAIN Fletton\nCON Maqbool, Yasmeen ABSTAIN West\nCON Simons, George ABSTAIN Paston\nCON Sanders, David name heard but unable to hear response Eye & Thorney\nCON Allen, Sue name not heard Orton Waterville\nCON Cereste Marco name not heard Stanground Central\nCON McKean, Dale name not heard Eye & Thorney\nCON Walsh, Irene name not heard Stanground Central\nCON Dalton, Matthew NOT VOTING West\nCON Day, Sue NOT VOTING Paston\nCON Elsey, Gavin NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Fitzgerald, Wayne NOT VOTING Bretton North\nCON Goodwin, Janet NOT VOTING Orton Longueville\nCON Harper, Chris NOT VOTING Stanground East\nCON Hiller, Peter NOT VOTING Northborough\nCON Holdich, John (OBE) NOT VOTING Ghinton & Wittering\nCON Kreling, Pam NOT VOTING Park\nCON Lamb, Diane NOT VOTING Glinton & Wittering\nCON Nadeem, Mohammed NOT VOTING Central\nCON Nawaz, Gul NOT VOTING Ravensthorpe\nCON North, Nigel NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Peach, John NOT VOTING Park\nCON Rush, Brian NOT VOTING Stanground Central\nCON Scott, Sheila NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Seaton, David NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Serluca, Lucia NOT VOTING Fletton\nCON Stokes, June NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Thacker, Paula NOT VOTING Werrington South\nCON Todd, Marion NOT VOTING East\nCON Over, David NOT VOTING Barnack\nLAB Forbes, Lisa FOR Orton Longueville\nLAB Jamil, Mohammed FOR Central\nLAB Johnson, Jo FOR East\nLAB Khan, Nazim (MBE) FOR Central\nLAB Knowles, John FOR Paston\nLAB Martin, Stuart FOR Bretton North\nLAB Shabbir, Nabil FOR East\nLAB Shearman, John FOR Park\nLAB Thulbourn, Nick FOR Fletton & Woodston\nLAB Murphy, Ed FOR Ravensthorpe\nLAB Sylvester, Ann FOR Bretton North\nLD Fower, Darren FOR Werrington South\nLD Sandford, Nick FOR Walton\nLD Shaheed, Asif FOR Walton\nLD Davidson, Julia name heard but unable to hear response Werrington South\nPIF Miners, Adrian declared interest, so unable to vote Dogsthorpe\nPIF Ash, Christopher FOR Dogsthorpe PIF Fletcher, Michael FOR Bretton South\nPIF Fox, John FOR Werrington North\nPIF Fox, Judith FOR Werrington North\nPIF Harrington, David FOR Newborough\nPIF Saltmarsh, Christabel FOR Dogsthorpe\nPIF Sharp, Keith FOR North\nPIF Swift, Charles (OBE) FOR “but confused” North\nPIF Lane, Stephen name not heard Werrington North\nI found it very difficult indeed to pick up the voices of the Conservative councillors last night. It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.\nI happily accepted an invitation to join a “participating audience” tonight and gave away my ticket for the James Galway concert in Ely Cathedral.\nI turned up at the Copeland Community Centre to listen to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) challenge the solar voltaic project planned for Newborough and which has been vocally and enthusiastically led by Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative), Leader of Peterborough City Council (Conservative) who believes it presents the answer to what he (Conservative) describes as “the black hole” created by the ConDem (but mainly Conservative) government of which Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) is an elected representative. They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked.

What do you think? Were you able to get to the evening exhibition (I missed it I’m afraid). And have you commented?\nBut the following Monday I received a very different second response. This one from Cllr John Shearman (here he is).\nFirst of all he apologises for not replying sooner. Frankly speediness of response is not the most important thing to me. And since I wrote about a jargon-prone subject which most people would find technical, difficult and tedious an over speedy response really wouldn’t impress me.\nBut offering an apology for responding within a week achieves so much. Starting like this says to me (these are my words, not his) “Hello, I am a human being with manners and I understand the common courtesies. Moreover I have standards: they are mine and…..”\nI don’t need to go on. And nor will I copy onto my blog the content of his response or our subsequent conversations. That would be impolite: he has expressed himself to me honestly, frankly and (absolutely critically important to me, and to anything relating to planning) he comes over as open-minded and prepared to listen. That is what I think people expect of a ward councillor.\nAnd, best of all, from what he says I can see that he has done his homework and understands the incinerator campaign work which has being quietly going on in the city. His email is a very tiny but very concise executive summary of how the situation actually is. Hats off.\nThank you, John.\nI am still waiting for a response from the third of my ward councillors.\nYesterday I wrote to my ward councillors. Today I opened an email, sent last night at 20:51. My first response! Here it is:\n“I have evaluated all your points & have complete confidence in the Council to do the right thing. If you had your way, we would all be living in caves.\nCllr Pam Kreling”\nWho is she? Here she is. (and the email address she used to respond!) This is one of my ward councillors, and she serves on no fewer than eight council committees, including Planning and Environmental Protection, Audit and, of all things: Strong and Supportive Communities.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_fire/content_689.html": "On Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_cycle/content_355.html": "An event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough-city-council_page_7/content_718.html": "Update 2: The two men who died between Yaxley and Farcet\nMy blog was partly about the alienating effect of cars and our road infrastructure and understanding why car parks and bridges over roads are chosen by suicidal (women, most often). As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\nMy January 2015 post received quite a bit of feedback and I realised that I was wrong about what the remedy is. Or at any rate that what I believed I meant was capable of being misunderstood. So, I don’t believe that the city needs a Clerk of Works any more. I believe that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works. I didn’t update my blog at the time (I often don’t) but now that the issue of budgets and management of major infrastructure projects at Peterborough City Council will be making headlines again, I am correcting my recommended solution so as to make absolutely clear to decision makers what I believe Peterborough needs.\nI learned last year that technically – i.e. on paper, legally, contractually and presumably somewhere in its accounts spreadsheet the council can actually claim to “have” a Clerk of Works. But also that (astonishingly) that function is currently performed by an employee or employees of the contractor doing the job and is not necessarily even a single nameable person. It may be “contractually normal” to organise a clerk of works function like this: I am told it is. But to my mind it is a notion, provided in the contract, but where it sits in any practical sense and who performs the function and why these persons unknown’s first loyalty should be our council and how the council can hold them accountable (for example by sacking them) is all shrouded in mystery. So a Clerk of Works is effectively useless: like a button floating free of the shirt, as it were.\nI believe now that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works who must be a member of Peterborough City Council’s staff, on their payroll and their payroll only and 100% and solely accountable to Peterborough City Council. I believe that role should be filled by a highly qualified person (i.e., they might have at least one civil engineering degree). They should be paid a professional and competitive salary and that the job should be advertised publicly and include local advertisements and the appointment process should be open to scrutiny within the council’s audit and compliance procedures.\nThe In House Clerk of Works I envisage would be supported by a planning department within the city council with immediate access to council archives and records. It is not good enough for planning staff to be located in one place and the documents in another. It is very difficult for members of the public to cope with the current system. How members of staff cope with using it on a daily basis beats me. I remain suspicious about how the Fletton Parkway contaminated land managed to come as a surprise to the Fletton Parkway Widening Project team:\nThe In House Clerk of Works should be empowered to scrutinise and halt any and all jobs done for the council at any stage in the application, approval and completion processes and to withhold sign off and payment until all the council’s quality standards are met. I hate seeing money being spent on works which are shoddy and unpleasing to the eye and hearing about decisions which nobody realised were as bad as they were at the time.* It does nothing for our local environments, which we pay good money to empower our councils to improve. And it does even less for our self respect as a city.\nIncidentally, taking down a wood or removing a green space is not a neutral act. In an Environment City you’d expect it to be considered especially controversial. But in addition to basic ecological concerns, woodland has long been used to conceal problems with the soil. Where you can’t grow a crop, farmers and landowners will often grow trees which will perform all sorts of useful functions within a landscape. Perhaps the cost of removing these particular patches of woodland and scrub will teach Peterborough to respect its green spaces and what they are actually doing a little more? We are often told by people who don’t realise we depend upon it and that we live in it that we “can’t afford” the environment. Perhaps this wacky but all too widespread reasoning informed the decision to widen Fletton Parkway? But in the city with the highest dependency on cars, it is likely that a £6M overspend (on top of what was originally budgeted) will be seen as “unavoidable” and “necessary”, because building a bigger road network remains at the uncontested top of Peterborough’s spending priorities.\n*For example:\nthe decision to turn one third of the A1139 parkway lights off and damaging whole lengths of under road cabling in the process, leaving a lethal bright stretch followed by a dark stretch, a bright stretch and another dark stretch. This light and dark lighting phenomenon (particularly noticeable near Stanground) happened all around the city because decision makers failed to check with the relevant qualified electrician what the impact of removing those particular light bulbs would be. In order to put it right all the affected lengths of road would have to be dug up.\n“Peterborough needs The Broadway Theatre, it does not need more flats. Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.\nI thought I’d share a couple of thoughts. The first is about “counting agents”. There was a recount for Fletton & Stanground called by UKIP, who were only three votes away from winning third place. The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.\nAttended\nJohn Peach CON\nBeki Sellick LD\nMohammad Yousaf CON\nAli Shan GREEN Absent but sent apologies\nRichard Ferris LAB\nArfan Khan CON\nJohn Shearman LAB\nGraham Whitehead UKIP Absent and no apology received (or read out)\nSabra Yasin LAB\nThis account is a transcription of my notes, intended solely for me and makes no pretensions to completeness.

But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.",

If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again. Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.",

Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarkedgets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nUpdate 2: The two men who died between Yaxley and Farcet\nMy blog was partly about the alienating effect of cars and our road infrastructure and understanding why car parks and bridges over roads are chosen by suicidal (women, most often). As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\n“Peterborough needs The Broadway Theatre, it does not need more flats. Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.\nWhile out I learned that the police or the government (depending which story you read) were investigating a possible fraud to do with the people who had signed the petition: some of whom didn’t live in the UK and some of whom were apparently surplus to the entire populations of whole countries, so presumably might consist only of an email address. 77,000 false signatures had apparently been removed. Variations on this tale are numerous but you have to go to twitter for a laugh.\nIncidentally isn’t it wonderful that a Leave petition is being so enthusiastically embraced by the Remain side? Perhaps the petitions office should have let the No Confidence in David Cameron petition get a debate? Looking back, it might have been an easier way for him to leave office and the office might not have been left in quite such an appalling mess.",

After the Conservatives insisted on two recounts and then insisted on yet another check, the Park Ward result was finally agreed some time after three o’clock this morning. I got to bed at 4am. The full results for the Peterborough City Council elections are here. Votes for the first First Past The Post Police and Crime Commissioner election are still being counted.\nI am extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me and who supported me in this election. Everything you did means a lot. Thank you so very much.\nFor me, the campaign I was most concerned about was the one run by Kirsty Knight to retain her seat and I congratulate her very very warmly on achieving this despite having made a tough and gutsy decision to leave the Green Party just a few weeks prior to the election. Kirsty has almost certainly broken another election campaign record and she has certainly set an excellent precedent for Peterborough. Thank you everyone who has supported Kirsty.\nIt was noticeable to me that a couple of newbie Liberal Democrat candidates also won with remarkably short campaigns. Hats off to both of them too.\nI feel for Nick Sandford who has to continue to perform his duties as Mayor (until the Mayor making ceremony) despite losing his seat last night. I know he’ll see the funny side, but still. While Peterborough elects in thirds, surely, most years, the Mayor doesn’t have to be someone facing election in the same year? It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?\nNothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nAs if Voter ID wasn’t enough, this year brings a new voting complication\nVoters delivering their votes by hand to the Town Hall may be surprised this year by the notices stapled to the doors warning them NOT to post their ballots in the Town Hall letter box without a “return form”. This is a new rule! A new form! Nothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nThe government has added yet another risk to voting postally. There are others, including postal delivery delays (extremely big risk at the moment), rejection of ballot due to signature or date not being matched (very small risk in my opinion, but still a risk), mislaying the pack from the council, theft of the pack or the ballot paper from someone who is vulnerable, someone who is being bullied, or someone who doesn’t understand or care (very big risk indeed).\nIncidentally, it is forbidden for candidates to handle anyone else’s postal packs or ballots. They should only ever handle their own. If a candidate or anyone you don’t trust completely offers to take your vote for you, please report it. You might be experiencing a crime and the council will check it out for you.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: it doesn’t look any better than it smells.\nThames Water’s creditors face a massive haircut if this Conservative government decides, despite its Conservative privatisation ideology, that it turns out to be the best organisation to put right the very stinky mess which Conservative deregulated private business ideologies seem to have combined to let of a utility company make.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: this doesn’t look any better than it smells, unless you happen to be a bond trader with money to flush.\nMeanwhile, global temperatures carry on breaking records. March was the eleventh consecutive month in which global sea and air temperatures broke records.\nWhy does voting independent in Park Ward makes sense this year? Because what I said in my address to voters last year remains true this year: Park Ward has exactly the same problems. But this year we have even more challenges and we need to start by describing them honestly.\nLast year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nBig Bins – outside flats and shops\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nHealth & Education services struggle with residents who move\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nResources for Roads\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.\nThis year I am standing as an independent candidate in Peterborough\nPolice and Crime Commissioner, Peterborough City Council and several parish council elections will be held on Thursday 2nd May. But this time, I am standing in Park Ward as an independent politician. This means that I can set my own campaign priorities and ignore group think and party lines. If elected, I would be free to vote only for those policies and decisions which would improve the lives of my constituents and which I personally agreed with.\nI supported Councillor Kirsty Knight’s successful Green Party campaigns last year. This year she is fighting to retain her seat for the first time as an independent councillor. This takes great courage and I respect her hugely for her decision. I endorse, am supporting, and will continue to support Kirsty after what I very much hope will be another victory and another campaign first. Please vote for and support Kirsty, who in her first term has already established herself as an outstanding city councillor.\nCollette Francis (who campaigned energetically for the Bretton Oak Tree and joined the Greens) is also standing in West as an independent candidate. As a serving parish councillor interested and competent in paperwork and planning, I am confident Collette will make a superb city councillor. Please vote for and support Collette.\nLastly, thank you to all those who have helped and tried to help during the past few months. I have heard every word and I appreciate all you have done and said. Thank you.\nPlease get in touch to support my campaigns, or those of Collette or Kirsty\nThe Nene is in flood, still transporting last summer and autumn’s above average rainfall to the Wash and new steadily heavy El Niño winter rain. Since my third update the Conservative administration at Peterborough City Council has been toppled and a well intentioned but inexperienced ex opposition multi party Cabinet is trying to keep the council’s finances afloat and to fix whatever has been going wrong. The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nPicture from the footbridge, showing the new Hilton on the south bank of the Nene\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?\npicture uploaded to Facebook about 2pm 7th January 2024\nThe monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nPark Ward votes against the trend\nPark Ward gifts Prime Minister Rishi Sunak half his morning after soundbites\nBy the morning after the election, it was already clear that the Conservatives were heading for an enormous number of local election defeats. For their Chairman “good” would have been keeping that number to just one thousand. They failed. And lost many more seats than that. The monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nBut, against this trend, in Park Ward two Conservatives were elected.\nThe result for Park Ward is interesting and in voting in two Conservatives, the ward went clean against the trend in the rest of the UK, which has so far (result in Redcar & Cleveland still to come in) seen the Conservatives net a loss of 1,058 seats.\nIn Park, Conservative candidate Arfan Khan came first and will serve the ward as city councillor for four years.\nConservative Muhammad Asif, on the other hand will serve a term of only one year, since by coming second, he won the seat vacated by ex Councillor Shaz Nawaz when he resigned, and whose term would have expired in 2024.\nMost people I canvassed were very keen not to see the Conservatives take Park. A huge number of people also know that it was a Conservative led council combined with many years of Conservative national governments which have brought the city to its current crisis, a council close to bankruptcy, many residents unable to provide themselves with food or heat indoors and as soon as you step outside the unmistakeable signs of neglect, deprivation and disempowerment are unavoidable.\nA Conservative win therefore baffles many people, including me, frankly. So what happened, how, and why?\nIs it a personal, rather than a party vote\nIn Arfan Khan’s case, his vote is a personal one and, I strongly suspect, nothing to do with which party he stood for.\nArfan Khan is an individual who commands great personal affection and respect in the community he serves as a funeral director.\nIs it a pragmatic, rather than a party vote\nThe Moslem community is currently trying to deal with issues at current burial sites and is keen to establish (a) new burial ground(s) in or near Peterborough and these campaigns will be more significant for many voters than any and all the goings on in Westminster.\nI can’t speak for or about Muhammad Asif, except to observe that, on the basis of his speech at the Park Ward hustings, he seems agreeable: mild and quietly spoken.\nWas Labour’s collapse more extreme in Park\nIn Park Ward, the resignation of the Labour Group Leader, ex Councillor Nawaz and the last minute resignation of ex Councillor Ikra Yasin prior to the elections will inevitably have damaged Labour’s chances in the ward, necessitating as they did, a last minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign. It is possible that the degree of Labour Party turbulence in Peterborough and especially in Park Ward is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Conventional wisdom would suggest that by this stage in the parliamentary electoral cycle, and with the current disgrace-inclined government, Labour should be able to wipe the board. Its supporters are angry that it isn’t taking opportunities when they are available. Labour could have taken control of Peterborough City Council, had it been allowed to work with other opposition councillors. As it is, Labour remains the hardest party to work with for the Greens (not just here), however helpful individual councillors might be.\nSo far, so good: these elements may be more or less peculiar to Park Ward. But I think most of the residents of the ward – and beyond – will still be bewildered that the Conservatives now hold two of the three city council seats representing residents in the ward. This is very clear in comments on Facebook.\nDefections to the Green Party\nBut the turmoil in Labour is worth returning to, since it has affected Peterborough’s Green election campaigns beyond Park Ward – and beyond Peterborough – too.\nPeterborough Greens (in common with Greens elsewhere in the country) have benefitted this year by the defections from Labour to our party of two excellent councillors. Bright Green published an article about this phenomenon. Unfortunately only one of ours (Cllr Heather Skibstead) succeeded in retaining her seat in Peterborough (which was Orton Longueville): she had more months and more of her own free time in which to communicate in advance of the election with her ward’s residents. However, her success represents a national first for the Green Party and we here as well as the party at large are delighted and very proud of this achievement.\nIt is really important for a political party to be able to manage post defection retention elections well. I’d like the Green Party to be a good place for good hard working conscientious councillors who’d much rather be with us, to defect to. Lots of councillors hang on in a political party they don’t really like, putting up with things they despise only because they know that being on your own and going independent is so risky. It makes sense that we work together to make it less risky to transfer a prior party allegiance to the Green Party. If you are reading this and are considering making such a step: please talk to us confidentially well in advance.\nWhen minus one equals plus one\nOddly, Heather’s retaining her seat counts as a GAIN for the Greens (even though as far as we were concerned, she was already a Green Party councillor), because the press compares the results of this with those of the previous election, which is guaranteed to confuse anyone not following things at this level of detail.\nThe second defector to our ranks this year was ex Cllr Imtiaz Ali. His arrival resulted in our biggest yet Green group of four on the council and I am sorry for him as well as for the group that he didn’t retain his Fletton & Woodston seat in this election. It would have been nearly if not impossible to win it, given the very short timescale available to his campaign.\nOnce again, despite losing Cllr Imtiaz Ali from our Green group on the council, Greens in Peterborough are reported in the media as having gained one councillor for the same confusing reasons. So despite gaining one, this picture on the council’s website on the day of the election, will soon reduce down to three councillors.\nBeyond all this excitement and a little further away in Orton Waterville, Councillor Nicola Day campaigned calmly and steadily to retain her seat and her campaign’s approach was rewarded with a huge margin of success, helping to entrench Orton Waterville’s reputation locally as an exceptionally well represented and very-happy-to-be-Green ward.\nThank you\nThis campaign has been truly extraordinary.\nThe achievement of Cllr Kirsty Knight in supporting members of another party getting used to Green ways of working cannot be overstated. This (as with many of her other roles) is not easy. Thank you Kirsty.\nIn this election our campaign teams have attempted more than ever before. Thank you for your votes. I have never received so many messages of support. I have never worked alongside so many volunteers and helpers. Our councillor team and our election team are quite simply, awesome. The reception candidates have received on doorsteps has been amazing and I feel that voters in Peterborough get us, at last. What we are, what we do, how we do it, and what we are capable of is just beginning to be understood. We are beginning to be seen, rather than described by outside hostile voices. The objectives we set ourselves are difficult and it is even more difficult to take people with us on these journeys, but I for one no longer feel I am on my own: there are people I have never met personally coming along beside me, who see me immediately they open their front door. I’d like to thank everyone who has appreciated us and lent us a hand during this campaign. We could not have achieved a fraction of what we have without such magnificent commitment and support. I hope you have enjoyed it and got something out of it as well. Thank you.\nreaders of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might explain the late declaration.\nThursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late.As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph.

Those with any hearing difficulties at all struggled, even when listening to those around the same table. The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available. The group was invited to apply for training places and also to extend that invitation out to people and into organisations and groups who hadn’t turned up, but which might nonetheless be interested.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2025_02_21_peterborough-city-councils-2025-6-budget-debate/content_111.html": "This meeting was live-streamed here. It began at 6pm.\nAbsence\nThe absence of ten councillors for the budget meeting is concerning. It is a high percentage. My very best wishes to Mayor Marco Cereste who has had a major health shock, and to his family. One councillor was legally prohibited from attending, pending a court appearance, but was able to ask a question from a remote location. I am very happy to live in a country where laws are respected and those who understand how best to implement them are able to do so. Hats off to officers for working to demonstrate a never before observed (by me, at any rate) example of inclusion.\nAbstainers\nElected representatives who ABSTAIN on a budget might be expressing frustration or unhappiness, which, however genuinely felt, are emotions of no practical use to the residents they were elected to serve. Where the budget is concerned, it is irresponsible, because a good budget requires effective team work.\nOpposers\nThere is a point in voting AGAINST a budget. But to vote usefully AGAINST a budget, you must have done your homework and have another “alternative” budget up your sleeve. And you must also have the support of other elected representatives, so that you can be confident that it stands a chance of being supported if presented. In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work. You could then vote AGAINST the budget presented by the administration of the government (in this case a council) with a clean conscience, because you have built a better option. When the administration’s proposed budget falls to pass, you can then present your alternative budget. This might be just what the people who elected you need you to do.\nYou can see the breakdown of votes and who said what here.\nHistory of partisan non cooperation\nPeterborough’s unitary government in recent years has too often featured two sides sneering at each other’s ideas and policies and individuals not listening to good alternative policies simply because they originate from outside their own hard baked ideology (a classic example was the destruction of the local 20’s Plenty campaign, achieved by kicking a worthwhile project into the long grass of a “pilot project” and then those who kicked it never brought the results of that project back to council). Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets. The independent panel seems to have helped sort this out.\nPlaying to the online gallery\nHowever there is still some bad behaviour. During council meetings, councillors are frequently talking to their electorate in the council chamber and putting themselves onto social media. Councillor Nicola Day even took a team selfie during the meeting. Some appear to struggle to put their phone down and are constantly watching their phones while on a livestream. They embarrass Peterborough and its residents. It should be possible for councillors to switch their phones off during a meeting: it is professional to do so and it is simply good manners to give your full attention to the agenda and to your colleagues in a meeting.\nOnly just\nThe passage of the council’s budget on Wednesday was too tight for comfort, but compared with recent years, it was a welcome moment of calm organisation. I congratulate all those who worked constructively with Councillor Mohammed Jamil, Cabinet Member for Finance & Corporate Governance, whose approach has been consultative and consensual, to contribute to it and to vote for it. Hats off especially to Councillor Dennis Jones and to Councillor Wayne Fitzgerald. Without their closing speeches, their clarity and eloquence, this might not have passed and I strongly suspect that there was no superior alternative budget waiting in the wings. Passing any kind of workable budget in this era of badly managed economic decline (Westminster has never ended the “Austerity”) is nothing short of miraculous. I had high hopes for a new Labour government, but so far it has disappointed.\nWe have yet to see what happens as the independent supervisory panel finally walks away.\nMany thanks for your insights, Fiona, and for going to the trouble. With local journalism in such a parlous state, I’m not sure where else I’d look for any kind of analysis of the Council’s budget decision-making process.\nTwo points.\nOne. It’s not just local councillors who are in thrall to their phones. MPs are also at fault (remember tractor man?).\nTwo. Anyone who was around in the days of Peterborough’s development corporation will know how they set out to do much more than build houses, roads, factory units and so on. They aimed to build a city where families would want to bring up their children, and the result was high quality modern libraries, top sports facilities and much more.\nSince those days Peterborough has got much bigger but the facilities that make life enjoyable have been pared back. Of course the country’s financial woes and government economic policy have an impact on what happens locally, but PCC decision-makers do seem to suffer from a sorry lack of ambition.\nNb.

The first is about “counting agents”. There was a recount for Fletton & Stanground called by UKIP, who were only three votes away from winning third place. The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.",

Venues for Hustings – for Candidates 2015\nPeterborough’s best hustings are often held in churches or schools. These can be public or closed events. Hustings they can be held anywhere and by any organisation. A school event is particularly interesting: because children often see politics as something which only happens on the television or on the radio. You are never too young to vote. You are never too young to debate a issue.\nThe person hosting the hustings will probably need a candidate to apply for one of these venues. The legislation (statute) governing this provision is the Representation of the People Act.\nThis hustings will happen later this week and there are rules (below the picture) about how to ask a question. The organisation of the hustings is up to the host.\nClick here for further details about the St Johns hustings\nI have never attended a hustings which got out of hand (close, but the well behaved sixth formers and their teachers worked hard to persuade candidates perhaps not to resort to fisticuffs). A calm, friendly and firm person in the chair will help ensure a hustings keeps its hair on. However the history of violence and intimidation within and working against the British democratic process is substantial and centuries old. This is well understood by parliament itself. So to help keep things peaceful and calm, legislation makes a police presence available to hustings organisers if they feel they need one. A very important, but perhaps not well understood statutory duty of the police is to uphold the democratic process, of which the hustings form a very important important part.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2021_08_23_is-that-a-clue-in-that-crack/content_342.html": "An enormous crack opened up on Henry Penn Walk and was reported (with extraordinary drone photos taken from above it) on 4th March 2021 in Peterborough Matters when a council spokesperson is reported to have said, “The current state of the walkway is a result of the structure, sheet piling, beneath the path falling.” On 2nd August 2021 the Peterborough Telegraph reported that the council and a corporate landowner were still at odds over who is responsible for the maintenance of this structure. This is an extraordinary standoff, given that a river is a highly dynamic entity, with carving into land and carrying it away away its favourite and constant sport. The embankment constitutes its urban restraint. Wouldn’t it make sense to fix the damage first and then sort out who owed how much in the courts? A few days ago I went to see whether or not the crack had been repaired I found a larger crack than I expected. Close up, the embankment undulates as if there’d been an earthquake or a landslip. A sort of fountain of subsoil sits at could conceivably be the source of the damage (if it got there by being thrust up right out of the ground). It is as if if water got stuck somewhere and had to burst up through what is a remarkably deep layer of tarmac. And guess what is growing just where that pile of subsoil is? Yes. Tomatoes. Of course, they could have been planted in an apartment garden. But wild tomatoes are common in the UK and they are celebrated self seeders. They can be spotted growing happily along railway tracks and wherever human manure distributes their tiny tell tale seeds. So my question is, given Anglian Water’s discovery of a major sewer works scandal not so very far away, at the junction of Wentworth Street and Bourges Boulevard this July (also reported to the council and in our local paper), has Anglian Water investigated whether or not something equally stinky might lurk beneath Peterborough embankment’s spectacular crack? Could damage to, neglect of, a blockage in or a fault in the drains cause damage on this scale? Or, conversely, could the crack have damaged a foul drain, enabling a tell tale seed or two to escape? After all, what force is there, other than water, capable of taking the huge corrugated steel retaining wall holding the embankment in place and bending it out of true? I’m no expert, but I can see that the embankment wall is not vertical any more. My theories about water transporting sewage carrying tomato seeds and pushing steel walls around might both be fanciful. But if anyone has a more sensible explanation, do tell.\nIs that a clue in that crack?\nTomatoes grow on Peterborough’s embankment\n2 thoughts on “Is that a clue in that crack?”",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++",

They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened.

Plus raffle with great prizes; and amazing auction of promises.\nLively upbeat toe-tappers and soft soulful melodies…\nfrom Stevie Wonder to the Eurythmics..\nI happily accepted an invitation to join a “participating audience” tonight and gave away my ticket for the James Galway concert in Ely Cathedral.\nI turned up at the Copeland Community Centre to listen to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) challenge the solar voltaic project planned for Newborough and which has been vocally and enthusiastically led by Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative), Leader of Peterborough City Council (Conservative) who believes it presents the answer to what he (Conservative) describes as “the black hole” created by the ConDem (but mainly Conservative) government of which Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) is an elected representative. They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked. Something has to be very seriously wrong: when nobody\nWhy does nobody ever challenge this preposterous pile of garbage? If someone fly-tipped vomit soaked nappies all over Cllr Nick Sandford (Liberal Democrat), would he actually mind? I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this. I think Peterborough should be enthusiastically refusing to reduce its tenanted farm land holdings.\nOnce Paul Stainton said they were starting to wind up and I still hadn’t succeeding in asking any of my questions I decided that since I wasn’t actually required as a speaking participant, as I had expected, I wasn’t going to be part of any awful preorganised tedious windbag wind up. So I left and expressed my feelings as clearly as I possibly could (being at that point absolutely livid) to David Murray, radio editor.\nSo what questions would I have asked? I had two: the first was in response to Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative). I wanted to ask him (and I’ll be honest I really wanted to ask this in front of a rolling TV camera):\nAnd the other one was to Stewart Jackson.

Those with any hearing difficulties at all struggled, even when listening to those around the same table. The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available.

The workshop explained how an “asset of community value” can be registered with the local council and what that means should it be or become threatened. The rules were explained and what and what was not eligible.\nThe new group is not a “political” group in that peoples’ views on the legislation may be strong, but those views are not the point. I would describe this as a “technical” alliance between people prepared to share knowledge and help people in Peterborough who want to do this. I was quite shocked to learn that Peterborough has only registered two Assets of Community Value (the Green Backyard and the Football Ground) whereas Chelmsford identified seventy which needed to be registered.\nWhat about the Lido? We need a little list.\nCllr Andy Coles acted as spokesperson for the Peterborough group at the workshop and he was an obvious elected councillor lead. For those who don’t know him he is a keen supporter of The Green Backyard and used to be its beekeeper. He has also supported the parishing of Westwood (a project currently in abeyance, but which I strongly support) and he currently holds the council’s “community” brief.\nAlun Williams volunteered to look after the membership.\nYou can join the new group on face book.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_waste/content_340.html": "Waste activism in Peterborough has a long and distinguished history and a great many people and many organised groups have got stuck in, many of them heroically and steadily cleaning up things which simply shouldn’t be where they are.\nThis blog years ago as a lament that I had not been able to achieve something I’d dedicated a great deal of time and energy to: stopping the construction of a plant to incinerate domestic waste. And in this blog I began to look at and discuss the politics of Peterborough generally, partly in order to understand and explain the weaknesses of campaigning organisations in the city (who I then felt could all have done better) against a political decision to incinerate, based on levels of (elected councillor) ignorance which I’d never encountered before in any organisation. I needed to understand how that had happened too, and who benefits from a toxic waste disposal policy. Who benefits from a waste policy which isn’t working.\nMeanwhile it seems that the attitudes I encountered: literally: “if you can’t see it, there is nothing there” approach to stack emissions has created a national problem, especially in England, which now does things worse and to lower standards than Scotland, Wales, the USA and Europe. Brexit might offer hope to those that are keen to practice toxic politics, but the toxins left in our environment aren’t going anywhere.\nBut about three years ago the Green Party began a Flash Mob Litter Pick, which roved around in response to resident callouts to deal with litter hotspots. Here’s a Flash Mob after a session litter picking in 2016, taken in a New England cul de sac: Like any litter picker, we were dealing with the council and its ways of doing things, with the odd hazardous item (discarded hypodermic needles are one of the worst at the moment) and we were also thinking about things like the bags the council uses, why people do what they do, where it comes from and how it travelled to where it is. We had hundreds of conversations, with each other, with passers by, with the council and with the people who deal with fly tipped toxic wastes (such as paints, oils, chemicals). It didn’t take us long to appreciate that people were sometimes being turned away by the legal disposal routes because of the way they had been implemented by the council or because of the conversations they had had with council operatives. We encountered a number of people who had been turned away from the Household Waste centre at Dogsthorpe. We realised that if you make people feel they are doing something wrong when they thought they were doing something right (they just didn’t know about the law or the procedure for doing what the council requires them to do) you are probably just building anti-council feelings and even another fly tip. The council operative is probably doing the right thing: saying all the right things, but the person to whom they are talking is struggling to cope with the situation. Some people get angry. Some people are shocked. In this situation, people may hear what is said to them, but they won’t be able to listen. So as we picked, we worked out that if one cul de sac could produce two car boot fulls of waste and a pile of fly tip, then there would be several skips full in each ward in the city. The volume of discarded waste lying around in our environment, defining our environment for everyone living or growing up in it – are unbelievable.\nWith fly tip, we looked at it and we began to understand the impact of the nice man at the front door who offers to take away your rubbish despite not having obtained the all important waste carrier’s licence. The role of this character is key: he (we think it is usually a he!) has perfectly understood the business opportunity provided to him by this corporate communications disaster.\nSometimes it is a whole house contents which is tipped out onto the highway, or someone else’s private property. Anybody in Peterborough can see that there is a big problem with landlords, or with people providing services to landlords and tenants. People living in or running the rental sector grab the cheapest furniture, because tenures are short and incomes are tight and what could be a re-use opportunity is instead a dumped problem. Legitimate house clearance businesses: where are they?\nJulie Howell (pictured here in New England) took the conclusions to Orton Waterville where she was a parish councillor and she applied herself to communicating directly with every resident. Waste management was just one of the things she tackled in her communications. Here she discusses fly tipping on her blog:\nhttp://howell4ortonwaterville.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/getting-grip-on-fly-tipping.html\nAnd here she is discussing fly tip on Radio Cambridgeshire yesterday morning:\nYesterday she was responding to the council leader who made some interesting comments in an article published in the Peterborough Telegraph soon after Julie was elected to the city councillor and thereby displaced the cabinet member responsible for waste management. The paper’s headline and the photograph put fly tipping into the spotlight.\nhttps://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/council-leader-pledges-new-efforts-to-tackle-fly-tipping-in-peterborough-1-8491096\nFirst he announces that fly-tipping will be “a focus” for the council this coming year. And admits that the issue was “repeatedly raised on the doorsteps in the run-up to the elections.” This might suggest that there is hope.\nBut then he says something really interesting. What he appears to do in a scant four lines of text, is give a summary of the results of the Free Bulky Waste Trial. I don’t know if a detailed analysis of the results of the trial has been made available to elected councillors or whether or not that analysis breaks down at ward level. But if not that is what I’d be asking for if I was a councillor.\nHoldich claims that the trial “made no difference to the amount of fly-tipping,” This suggests that the council has a way of very accurately measuring fly tipping activity over a period of time. That would be very interesting, if it were true. I think the police might be interested in how the council knows this too, since not being able to catch fly tippers is one of its defining and most annoying characteristics.\nThen he asserts that “the council missed out on £40,000 from fewer paid collections.” Now, assuming he’s right about that, it suggests to me that the people making use of the free trial were people who would otherwise have called the council to arrange a paid for collection. This group of people, complying with existing procedures and forking out for the collections they organise does not strike me as an appropriate target group if you wanted to attract the waste which is being fly tipped and the people doing the fly tipping, because this group is by Holdich’s definition not fly-tipping their waste anyway. They are doing it correctly and dutifully providing the council with additional revenue.\nThen Holdich claims that “It’s a national problem and nobody has come up with a panacea.” I think by calling on a Greek goddess, he is both looking for and deriding a universal fix. He might do better if he looked systematically at another goddess: Hygeia is the Greek goddess of cleanliness and hygiene, a goddess understood by the Greeks to be part of Aesclepius’ family of medicine, health and feeling good generally.\nBut let’s have a closer look at the council’s “Free Bulky Waste Trial”. It was designed to run for thirteen weeks: from 11th December to 9th March. A bulky waste collection normally costs £23.50. So adding up the available collections during the free trial, we have a cap of 52 collections per day, and an estimated “more than 1,000 free collections” during month one. Then a maximum of 26 per day for the remainder of the trial. Residents would be free to book a collection between 4th December to 5th March. So what actually happened?\nWe don’t know, except that the available slots were taken up enthusiastically to the extent that no more bookings for free collections were taken from 25th January, six weeks before the trial was supposed to end. Taking Christmas into account, the Trial stopped half way through. In fact it didn’t survive the Spring Clean Season. When the council closed new advance bookings, it was clear already that it was well organised people who were using the trial.\nWhat we do know is that if £40,000 revenue was lost to the council because people using the trial would otherwise have booked a chargeable collection, then 1702 free collections were made who’d otherwise pay for those collections. These will have been well organised people complying with procedures, who probably were unlikely to be fly tipping waste or giving it to to a fly tipper masquerading as a legitimate waste handler before the trial began.\nThe big question, then, is how many collections were made above 1702.\n52 per day for the first month would give us four weeks one of which includes the Christmas break. So let’s say 52 x 4 x 3 = 624\nThen we have 26 per day for the other nine weeks, so x 4 x 9 = 936\nIf we add these figures together and take them away from 1702, we get 142.\nRoughly one hundred and forty two collections were available to people who maybe would NOT normally have called the council. And that figure can only be true if the council and those people were able to use every single slot it had available. Given that this target group is likely to be less well organised, less well resourced and generally less compliant with how the council runs things, I find this highly unlikely.\nWe don’t know if the council added capacity, as it promised it would at the outset of the trial if demand was high. And if it didn’t, we don’t know why it didn’t. It may have realised that the non fly tipping community was not engaging very much with its trial, and if so, that would not surprise me.\nI am sure that Holdich feels that the trial proves his point. I dare say it proves mine too: that the systems in place are unfit for purpose for many sections of our community and it is also clear that the ruling Conservatives still have no sensible plan in place to change that.",

That is why I wrote about the sensation of falling which is how the shock of the allegations first affected me.\nI have been too busy out and about campaigning to write much about this story but while I’ve been busy a great deal has happened. This post is an update and a pulling together of threads.\nThe council can’t do anything\nFirstly in response to a number of points and questions I communicated to the council’s leader and chief executive officer, the council has explained its position with respect to removing an elected representative:\n“The legal position is that all democratically elected councillors, are entitled as of right to attend all meetings of full council. There is no power for officers or members to remove that right.”\nSo while “Jessica” believes that Coles should resign as a city councillor (and I wholeheartedly support her call) I don’t think that anybody can force that to happen. If Coles continues not to resign, it seems that he can’t be pushed.\nHis party won’t do anything\nI believe that a decent political party would have suspended Coles already, pending clarification of his situation. However his party is the Conservative Party which is in power and which has been close to being in power for a century. It is an integral part of the establishment which has used the police to target over 1,000 organisations, including my own political party, my party’s only MP and my party’s only member of the House of Lords. This is why I personally have no expectations that the Conservative Party will even worry about behaving decently: that simply isn’t what the party or the British establishment is about. They are about power full stop. If they did suspend or expel him I would expect him to opt to remain in post as an independent councillor. This may be more of a worry to them than his remaining in post. The horrible question which then arises is where are the other 120 ex spy cops and how do their current networks, contacts, employments or appointments help to protect their secrets and abuses or those of others and to what extent and how might such arrangements be tolerated or even organised? Let’s not underestimate the usefulness of professional, political and cultural networks. Cllr Coles is one of the best connected people in Peterborough.\nThree investigations are underway: none of which stop him talking\nBack to fast moving present reality. There are now three investigations or cases ongoing. As far as I am aware none of these require Coles to maintain silence on the allegations: his silence is entirely a matter of personal choice, not of contractual or legal obligation. I am as ever happy to be corrected.\nwhich at first glance looks as if the IPCC is not investigating and did not investigate. But if you check what the IPCC does and how it does it, it is perfectly possible that this interpretation is not quite correct. IPCC can supervise local investigations without actually doing them. This statement does not eliminate the possibility that it could be involved in supervising a Cambridgeshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (Cambridgeshire OPCC or here just OPCC) investigation which hasn’t started yet. As for regulations, here is something which may or may not help in understanding what they are and what will or won’t happen next.\nIn order to understand what has or hasn’t happened here, it would be necessary to see both referrals and to form a judgement about their sufficiency or otherwise. It would also be necessary to understand whether these referrals relate only to Coles’ behaviour while he was applying for or occupying the post of Cambridgeshire Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner (as I strongly suspect is the case).\nMeanwhile the local paper indicates that the Cambridgeshire OPCC has delegated the investigation to the Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel. This body meets next on 6th September. The agenda for that meeting is not yet online, but it should be available on the 1st at the latest.\nWe really do need to know what Coles’ motives were in going for the role of Deputy PCC and we need to know everything about who knew the whats and the whys about that appointment.\nI have asked people why the council hadn’t gone all out to fund a replacement bridge as soon as it realised Rhubarb Bridge was suffering an unusual degree of decay. This would have made sense, especially since there are national funding pots for sustainable travel infrastructure, and this bridge might well have qualified.\nSince then I have I received one really useful reply. My interlocutor pointed out to me that the money for repairs and maintenance comes out of the Revenue pot at the council. Revenue is for running costs, costs which recur year after year. The money for the an surface roundabout or for a replacement bridge would come out of the Capital pot. Capital is for one off costs, for buying or building assets such as buildings and infrastructure.\nThis made me think. Pressure on the Revenue pot is extreme. And it might be this extreme funding pressure which is leading to a decision not to maintain. If it replaces an an annual maintenance bill with a one off capital bill (with arguably a smaller ongoing maintenance cost), it will be relieving pressure on the funds which are needed to look after people in extreme need.\nFunding pressures on local government affect their Revenue funding primarily. Pressure on capital funding is not as bad. Revenue funds are used to fund social care, road repairs and waste disposal. It is this funding stream which is under impossible strains as central government imposes its Austerity measures and renders all our services less and less able to cope. So all local authorities have to balance roads and waste against social care. It is quite clearly insane, but until we sack the government as we are entitled to do at each general election, there is no sign of a change in this wicked situation. And local authority roads get a small fraction of the maintenance money which Highways England gets to maintain trunk roads. Unfortunately Rhubarb Bridge does not belong to Highways England. It belongs to the council.\nThis leaves a number of items which haven’t been accounted for: lets call them uncounted elephants in the room:\nThe likely cost of accidents at an at surface crossing. It is clear that this has not been factored in. There is clearly an increased risk of impacts on emergency, hospital and care services budgets.\nThe impact of being at ground level at an air pollution hot spot on all pedestrian and cyclists using the route. The higher you are the less likely you are to be inhaling high concentrates of particulates. The closer you are the more certain it is. In pushchairs children are face to face with exhaust pipes and this is just one reason (of many) why parents pop them in what seems to be the safer environment of a car.\nThe at surface crossing will result in cyclists taking to the road, rather than wait.\nThe at surface crossing will result in people getting into a car in preference to walking with a pram or pushchair.\nAnd it leaves my original question standing: why the council hasn’t tried to get hold of (let us add “capital”) funding to rebuild the bridge – if it is beyond economic repair?\nAn event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).\nI attended an event last Thursday which was about Rhubarb Bridge, but before I post anything about that, this is just a little news about the next bridge over the A47 going east (towards Wisbech). This bridge is on Highways England’s list of repairs and should be getting some much needed attention very soon. I hope it isn’t closed for long. It is certainly not planned for demolition. It is a useful bridge enabling cyclists and pedestrians to shortcircuit (North /South) one of Peterborough’s oddest and most confusing roundabouts over and onto the A47 (as it goes East/West).\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nPlease let me know if I have been incorrectly advised.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nIf whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so promptly, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity and (unfortunately now) your stated personal approval (I think you may have done this in some ignorance of the gravity of what has been alleged – I know you are a very busy man).\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well. It is important that the Andy …\nIn her own words: “I welcome the news that Andy Coles has resigned from his post as Cambridgeshire’s Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner. I would like to know …\nColes did resign quickly and in terms of media coverage in a sudden and media-spectacular way from his post as Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner but he did this on the basis that the allegations were getting in the way of him performing the role, not on a point of principle or honour. I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nA list is available below the video on this post.\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him. It is reasonable that he is suspended. It is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while these dreadful allegations remain unresolved.\nPeterborough Green Party supports the continued use of the Spectators Gallery as what it says on this notice:\nSpectators Gallery sign in Peterborough Town Hall showing the way up four flights of stairsand the door leading to it from Bridge Street. #OpenTheDoor (locked last Wednesday).\nPress Coverage of Coles’ resignation from his PCC role\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned following allegations that he deceived … Cambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy Coles resigns.\nThe allegation relates to Andy Coles‘ work as an undercover police officer in the 1990s. … Cambridgeshire’s deputy PCC resigns over ‘sex deceit’ claim.\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned after being accused of deceiving a woman into a sexual relationship while he was an undercover officer.

I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

This is an extraordinary standoff, given that a river is a highly dynamic entity, with carving into land and carrying it away away its favourite and constant sport. The embankment constitutes its urban restraint. Wouldn’t it make sense to fix the damage first and then sort out who owed how much in the courts? A few days ago I went to see whether or not the crack had been repaired I found a larger crack than I expected. Close up, the embankment undulates as if there’d been an earthquake or a landslip. A sort of fountain of subsoil sits at could conceivably be the source of the damage (if it got there by being thrust up right out of the ground). It is as if if water got stuck somewhere and had to burst up through what is a remarkably deep layer of tarmac. And guess what is growing just where that pile of subsoil is? Yes. Tomatoes. Of course, they could have been planted in an apartment garden. But wild tomatoes are common in the UK and they are celebrated self seeders. They can be spotted growing happily along railway tracks and wherever human manure distributes their tiny tell tale seeds. So my question is, given Anglian Water’s discovery of a major sewer works scandal not so very far away, at the junction of Wentworth Street and Bourges Boulevard this July (also reported to the council and in our local paper), has Anglian Water investigated whether or not something equally stinky might lurk beneath Peterborough embankment’s spectacular crack? Could damage to, neglect of, a blockage in or a fault in the drains cause damage on this scale? Or, conversely, could the crack have damaged a foul drain, enabling a tell tale seed or two to escape? After all, what force is there, other than water, capable of taking the huge corrugated steel retaining wall holding the embankment in place and bending it out of true? I’m no expert, but I can see that the embankment wall is not vertical any more. My theories about water transporting sewage carrying tomato seeds and pushing steel walls around might both be fanciful. But if anyone has a more sensible explanation, do tell.\nIs that a clue in that crack?\nTomatoes grow on Peterborough’s embankment\n2 thoughts on “Is that a clue in that crack?”",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2024_04_19_address-to-voters-2/content_195.html": "Last year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nHowever, what I said last year about what needs doing in Park Ward has not changed. Park Ward still suffers from the same problems, so please re-read last year’s address. But this year I’m adding a couple of things:\nBin Lids – outside houses\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nBig Bins – outside flats and shops\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nHealth & Education services struggle with residents who move\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nResources for Roads\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.",

That is why I wrote about the sensation of falling which is how the shock of the allegations first affected me.\nI have been too busy out and about campaigning to write much about this story but while I’ve been busy a great deal has happened. This post is an update and a pulling together of threads.\nThe council can’t do anything\nFirstly in response to a number of points and questions I communicated to the council’s leader and chief executive officer, the council has explained its position with respect to removing an elected representative:\n“The legal position is that all democratically elected councillors, are entitled as of right to attend all meetings of full council. There is no power for officers or members to remove that right.”\nSo while “Jessica” believes that Coles should resign as a city councillor (and I wholeheartedly support her call) I don’t think that anybody can force that to happen. If Coles continues not to resign, it seems that he can’t be pushed.\nHis party won’t do anything\nI believe that a decent political party would have suspended Coles already, pending clarification of his situation. However his party is the Conservative Party which is in power and which has been close to being in power for a century. It is an integral part of the establishment which has used the police to target over 1,000 organisations, including my own political party, my party’s only MP and my party’s only member of the House of Lords. This is why I personally have no expectations that the Conservative Party will even worry about behaving decently: that simply isn’t what the party or the British establishment is about. They are about power full stop. If they did suspend or expel him I would expect him to opt to remain in post as an independent councillor. This may be more of a worry to them than his remaining in post. The horrible question which then arises is where are the other 120 ex spy cops and how do their current networks, contacts, employments or appointments help to protect their secrets and abuses or those of others and to what extent and how might such arrangements be tolerated or even organised? Let’s not underestimate the usefulness of professional, political and cultural networks. Cllr Coles is one of the best connected people in Peterborough.\nThree investigations are underway: none of which stop him talking\nBack to fast moving present reality. There are now three investigations or cases ongoing. As far as I am aware none of these require Coles to maintain silence on the allegations: his silence is entirely a matter of personal choice, not of contractual or legal obligation. I am as ever happy to be corrected.\nwhich at first glance looks as if the IPCC is not investigating and did not investigate. But if you check what the IPCC does and how it does it, it is perfectly possible that this interpretation is not quite correct. IPCC can supervise local investigations without actually doing them. This statement does not eliminate the possibility that it could be involved in supervising a Cambridgeshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (Cambridgeshire OPCC or here just OPCC) investigation which hasn’t started yet. As for regulations, here is something which may or may not help in understanding what they are and what will or won’t happen next.\nIn order to understand what has or hasn’t happened here, it would be necessary to see both referrals and to form a judgement about their sufficiency or otherwise. It would also be necessary to understand whether these referrals relate only to Coles’ behaviour while he was applying for or occupying the post of Cambridgeshire Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner (as I strongly suspect is the case).\nMeanwhile the local paper indicates that the Cambridgeshire OPCC has delegated the investigation to the Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel. This body meets next on 6th September. The agenda for that meeting is not yet online, but it should be available on the 1st at the latest.\nWe really do need to know what Coles’ motives were in going for the role of Deputy PCC and we need to know everything about who knew the whats and the whys about that appointment.\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nPlease let me know if I have been incorrectly advised.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nIf whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so promptly, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity and (unfortunately now) your stated personal approval (I think you may have done this in some ignorance of the gravity of what has been alleged – I know you are a very busy man).\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well. It is important that the Andy …\nIn her own words: “I welcome the news that Andy Coles has resigned from his post as Cambridgeshire’s Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner. I would like to know …\nColes did resign quickly and in terms of media coverage in a sudden and media-spectacular way from his post as Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner but he did this on the basis that the allegations were getting in the way of him performing the role, not on a point of principle or honour. I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nA list is available below the video on this post.\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him. It is reasonable that he is suspended. It is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while these dreadful allegations remain unresolved.\nPeterborough Green Party supports the continued use of the Spectators Gallery as what it says on this notice:\nSpectators Gallery sign in Peterborough Town Hall showing the way up four flights of stairsand the door leading to it from Bridge Street. #OpenTheDoor (locked last Wednesday).\nPress Coverage of Coles’ resignation from his PCC role\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned following allegations that he deceived … Cambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy Coles resigns.\nThe allegation relates to Andy Coles‘ work as an undercover police officer in the 1990s. … Cambridgeshire’s deputy PCC resigns over ‘sex deceit’ claim.\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned after being accused of deceiving a woman into a sexual relationship while he was an undercover officer.

It is where the Conservative Party stand the candidates they really don’t want to risk losing. Brian Mawhinney (eventually CON Party Chairman) was MP for Peterborough but was moved to the neighbouring North West Cambridgeshire constituency when Peterborough started to look a bit too risky.\nA “safe” seat presents a number of challenges to residents but also to opposition parties, one of which is that voters who know their vote “doesn’t count” (in terms of securing democratic representation) are inclined to think that their vote “isn’t counted” (but watch this video to see why this is an entirely different thing!).\nThe church says: “Once again there will be a hustings for the Peterborough constituency for the forthcoming general election in St John’s Church.\nIf you would like to submit a question please email the church office (office@peterborough-stjohns.org.uk) and we will select from those suggested to ensure fair balance. If your question is chosen we will contact you to ask if you would be prepared to ask it at the hustings. Please note that only the question should be asked, as scripted, and no additional statements or comments added.\nQuestions should be directed to all of the candidates without bias or favour. There are strict rules governing hustings to ensure fairness and avoid bias. We will be following these rules carefully.\nThis hustings is being organised by the church and everyone is welcome.\nWe expect all the following candidates to attend the hustings:\nStewart Jackson (Conservative)\nFiona Onasanya (Labour)\nFiona Radić (Green)\nBeki Sellick (Liberal Democrat)”\n“Peterborough needs The Broadway Theatre, it does not need more flats. Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.\nI thought I’d share a couple of thoughts. The first is about “counting agents”. There was a recount for Fletton & Stanground called by UKIP, who were only three votes away from winning third place. The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.\nAttended\nJohn Peach CON\nBeki Sellick LD\nMohammad Yousaf CON\nAli Shan GREEN Absent but sent apologies\nRichard Ferris LAB\nArfan Khan CON\nJohn Shearman LAB\nGraham Whitehead UKIP Absent and no apology received (or read out)\nSabra Yasin LAB\nThis account is a transcription of my notes, intended solely for me and makes no pretensions to completeness.

Had organised the slate of 29 UKIP candidates this year. A long & (I thought) well written (compared to last year’s) statement was read out.\nYesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another.

To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_embankment/content_398.html": "An enormous crack opened up on Henry Penn Walk and was reported (with extraordinary drone photos taken from above it) on 4th March 2021 in Peterborough Matters when a council spokesperson is reported to have said, “The current state of the walkway is a result of the structure, sheet piling, beneath the path falling.” On 2nd August 2021 the Peterborough Telegraph reported that the council and a corporate landowner were still at odds over who is responsible for the maintenance of this structure. This is an extraordinary standoff, given that a river is a highly dynamic entity, with carving into land and carrying it away away its favourite and constant sport. The embankment constitutes its urban restraint. Wouldn’t it make sense to fix the damage first and then sort out who owed how much in the courts? A few days ago I went to see whether or not the crack had been repaired I found a larger crack than I expected. Close up, the embankment undulates as if there’d been an earthquake or a landslip. A sort of fountain of subsoil sits at could conceivably be the source of the damage (if it got there by being thrust up right out of the ground). It is as if if water got stuck somewhere and had to burst up through what is a remarkably deep layer of tarmac. And guess what is growing just where that pile of subsoil is? Yes. Tomatoes. Of course, they could have been planted in an apartment garden. But wild tomatoes are common in the UK and they are celebrated self seeders. They can be spotted growing happily along railway tracks and wherever human manure distributes their tiny tell tale seeds. So my question is, given Anglian Water’s discovery of a major sewer works scandal not so very far away, at the junction of Wentworth Street and Bourges Boulevard this July (also reported to the council and in our local paper), has Anglian Water investigated whether or not something equally stinky might lurk beneath Peterborough embankment’s spectacular crack? Could damage to, neglect of, a blockage in or a fault in the drains cause damage on this scale? Or, conversely, could the crack have damaged a foul drain, enabling a tell tale seed or two to escape? After all, what force is there, other than water, capable of taking the huge corrugated steel retaining wall holding the embankment in place and bending it out of true? I’m no expert, but I can see that the embankment wall is not vertical any more. My theories about water transporting sewage carrying tomato seeds and pushing steel walls around might both be fanciful. But if anyone has a more sensible explanation, do tell.\nIs that a clue in that crack?\nTomatoes grow on Peterborough’s embankment",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_06_26_second-referendum-petition-1/content_382.html": "A petition launched apparently launched three weeks before Thursday’s decision of the UK electorate to Leave the EU has garnered over three million signatures since Thursday as I write at half past ten on Sunday morning.\nSomeone asked me:\n“I have 5 friends sharing this. The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\n- a statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\n- a statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\n- the revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\n- the loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\n- the loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\n- the exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\n- the exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\n- the exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\n- the possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\n- the likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\n- no plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\n- the awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\n- Leave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\n- Leave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\n- the growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_01_04_philippa-and-the-judge/content_360.html": "Today’s story about the jailing of Philippa by Judge Noble in Peterborough highlights several critical problems in Peterborough.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\nRanked with all the other parliamentary constituencies in the UK, the City of Peteborough is ranked fifth from the bottom. Bad driving is at epidemic levels in the city and around it. And given its appalling safety record, one has to ask why Judge Noble feels any need to conciliate the community of motorists living anywhere round here.\nThis is not Philippa’s fault either.\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\n4 Jan 2017\nA thought provoking article raising many excellent points\nLikeLike\nVery thoughtfully written Fiona, it’s so sad to see the judiciary not recognising mental health issues and the support that is needed. You should send this as an open letter to the judge. I wonder is anyone appealing on Phillippa’s behalf, surely this could be overturned – it just doesn’t make sense!\nLikeLike\nHaving spent time with Mel Shaw I can guarantee that Philippa will receive no professional care at HMP Peterborough. They cannot even get adequate GP cover. She must be released to proper facilities\nLikeLike",

He was responding to ‘the Mayor‘s review’ or, to give it its full name, ‘The review into Operation Span and the investigation of non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’ which has just been published. The next speaker was Rochdale Council leader Councillor Neil Emmott, the leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, who also apologised for what the council had got wrong.\nNext came three women, each of whom had headed up an organisation working with the thousands of (mostly female and very young) victims of human trafficking and sexual abuse. (nobody’s names came up from start to finish). The first woman had been through the barrier known as the end of one’s tether, her hair got in her way, and she was gasping for air and needed water, but she was clearly a warrior and won my respect for getting out in short order the horrible truths she needed to speak.\nThe second woman was wearing a very smart cream dress and had her hair and make up done: full Manchester female in armour, elegantly equipped equally for the dance floor, lifting someone up out of the gutter, or take her presentation to any board room or civic assembly rooms of the city prepared to listen to what goes on in the darkest corners of the city: where corruption, physical, emotional and psychological abuse and the systemic collusion of letting offenders go: the institutional joint enterprise (how come that is not an offence, she asks?) of deliberately letting known and identified criminals walk free.\nShe struck a line through the whole of the older Oldham predecessor report, revealing that during that investigation, only one victim had been able to speak to the reviewers. It’s people like her I want to see working where they can do what is needed: in the House of Lords.\nThen, just as the third woman, in a dark suit began speaking, she was rudely interrupted by a far more important man: Grant Schapps, talking about the state of the world and threats had multiplied and increased in severity during the horrible reign of his own ghastly Tory Party. I have no idea what the third woman wanted to say.\nHow dare the BBC cut this third woman short? They had three channels they could have used. BBC1, BBC2 and BBCNews.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough-city-council_page_6/content_720.html": "There’s a Hole in your Logic\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nLet’s look at what Fiona Onasanya has had to say on electoral reform. A quick google search produces no comments on electoral reform (except where her name comes up alongside mine!). (Beki Sellick: very similar). As for Stewart Jackson: he has voted against electoral reform or been absent on every available occasion.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nGiven the maths, I don’t rate Labour’s chances in Peterborough at all. I don’t think Lisa Forbes thought she stood a hope either. There is only one candidate who could have swung it, in my opinion: the one who won) in the Peterborough area in the PCC election in 2012.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\nI hope this letter helps to minimise that risk.\nUseful links:\ntactical2017.com #Tactical2017\nTimeline:\n25/4/17 11:26 LAB 2015 candidate regrets she can’t stand in June 2017\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n29/4/17 12:50 UKIP announces it won’t field a candidate\n2/5/17 11:54 Greens announce their Peterborough (& NWC) selection results\n2/5/17 23:34 LAB reveal Fiona Onasanya is their Peterborough candidate\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

Many people will not be focussing on getting out and about, struggling instead to keep warm with the help of government funded warm hubs. I knew about the council’s hubs, but doubted that people knew how to find them. Last time I’d looked there were about five. Today I found nineteen. The number and complexity of strikes is also exploding as perfectly understandable and justifiable discontent escalates. I’d prefer if this public calendar didn’t stay true for very long, but it is true today. If wage disputes were settled and people received the incomes at levels they need, this Strikes & Warm Hubs Calendar could very quickly be made redundant. But unfortunately only the ruling Tories who make up this awful Westminster government can do that.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_05_09_what-didnt-happen/content_685.html": "Thursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late. As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized/content_405.html": "held in Park Ward on 16th April\nSome people were disappointed at the turnout at yesterday’s candidate hustings at the Willow Cafe in Park Ward, but top community activists tell me that “the people who turn up to things are the right people”.\nThe event was hosted by Park Streets Ahead Residents Association and hosted by Beki Sellick (in her capacity as Chair).\nI was making a cup of tea this morning and it dawned on me that there had been a disproportionately high number of sustainable transport professionals in the room. That speaks to ongoing safety and speeding issues in Park Ward and it tallies with despair on the doorstep that the well understood underlying problems persist unfixed. In fact if we rearranged the chairs in the room, we probably had the skills right there in the room to fix the problem. What these experts don’t have (as things stand) is the council’s ear. Once again, it is often the case that the solutions are not somewhere else: we’ve likely got them right here, in Park Ward.\nCandidates on the ballot paper turned up, with the exception of the Labour and Reform candidates.\n| ARFAN Khan | address is on ballot | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| ASIF Muhammad | (address in Peterborough) | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| HARDMAN Ian | address is on ballot | Liberal Democrat |\n| HUSSAIN Junayd | (address in Peterborough) | Labour & Co-operative Party |\n| MORRIS Sue | (address in Peterborough) | Reform UK |\n| RADIC Fiona | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| WILSON Steve | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| YASIN Sabra | (address in Peterborough) | Labour Party |\nThe full list for all wards is here.\nAttending in the audience, were just the right number of loud voices. True, many people didn’t say anything, but, for whatever reason, they decided not to speak.\nIt was not a scary event. There were no fights and I did not spot intimidation. However, I took one concern expressed to the host at face value and will catch up with this (and them) as and when I can.\nI have come across electoral malpractices including intimidation which is a known (but I believe increasingly historic) problem in Park Ward and it is one of the reasons why CCTV cameras are frequently installed outside some or all of Park’s polling stations. I am aware of various pressures which have been applied over the years to voters in Park Ward (they tell me about shocking things going on in the past). Most of these pressures are “normal” family, social or party influences and feelings of obligation, which are part of normal life and a functioning democracy. But once a person feels they are being bullied, losing their right to choose freely or even having their vote stolen, voters and candidates shouldn’t hesitate to call the police or Electoral Services at the council (who can work out what the problem might be and will liaise with the police if necessary).\nJohn Peach in the middle of the room does not (in my book) constitute intimidation: his body language and his Cheshire Cat grin said louder than words how much enjoyed the event (announced on the 5th), despite failing to invite his online newsletter readers (emailed on the 8th) across the ward to it. Probably a communication problem rather than a deliberate omission.\nThere was disappointment expressed by a couple of people at the event’s format, which was cabaret layout for the audience and mingling for candidates, designed to facilitate more personal encounters. The room has a lovely but hard floor so for the hard of hearing one speaker at a time would work, whereas two voices would blur each other out. There was a very good (but also very well resourced) accessible hustings held during Peterborough’s parliamentary by-election in 2019.\nIt is worth pointing out that the traditional format (high table at the top for the candidates and seats for the public arranged as if for a theatre show – like BBC Question Time) does allow for the person who wants to ask a question to take the floor and, if they want to, to command the room. This can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues . It also allows for a bit of tit for tat between candidates and lets them demonstrate (and develop and practice) any debating skills they have: very likely to come in handy if elected.\nThe event was recorded by an unknown individual at the back who didn’t ask permission or make himself known to the host. I have no idea if the recording will go anywhere: but I doubt it. Shout if you spot it.\nNobody took names of attendees or pictures. It was probably the least “posed” hustings I’ve attended and that makes a pleasant change.\nSo, in summary all good. Thank you Park Streets Ahead for the invitation. And well done, Beki Sellick for doing very well the incredibly tough job of chairing.\nI got a great deal out of attending and personally enjoyed it very much. I learned many things, including that when the awesome Rosemary was elected the youngest ever female councillor in Scotland, her campaign had focussed on housing and the position of wardrobes in bedroom layouts. Presumably at a time of massive council house building. I shall have to catch up with her again to find out more. Something else on the list for after the election.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_environment_page_3/content_559.html": "Yesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.",

The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe notorious collapse of Henry Penn Walk continues, visible to anybody walking over the bridge between Peterborough Town Hall on Bridge Street and the council offices at Sand Martin House. Read my previous updates for the history of this persistently unremedied collapse.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers.

It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.\nI happily accepted an invitation to join a “participating audience” tonight and gave away my ticket for the James Galway concert in Ely Cathedral.\nI turned up at the Copeland Community Centre to listen to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) challenge the solar voltaic project planned for Newborough and which has been vocally and enthusiastically led by Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative), Leader of Peterborough City Council (Conservative) who believes it presents the answer to what he (Conservative) describes as “the black hole” created by the ConDem (but mainly Conservative) government of which Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) is an elected representative. They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked. Something has to be very seriously wrong: when nobody\nunderstands the process\nbothers to explain it\nknows what it is or\nwhy it is there\nWhy does nobody ever challenge this preposterous pile of garbage? If someone fly-tipped vomit soaked nappies all over Cllr Nick Sandford (Liberal Democrat), would he actually mind? I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\nlack of transparency (no figures available to the residents of Peterborough and – because I couldn’t ask my second question the audience was able to rest secure in the assumption – to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) himself.\ntreatment of farmers (I’ll expand for him here: the council’s first communication to 18 farmers was to warn them that they would be evicted if the plan went ahead)\nrisk of a change in the subsidy regime: no safety plan if the government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) changes the regime governing ROCs (again no discussion: no explanation)\nno contingency fund if the sums are wrong\nconflict with government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) policy on renewables (this was not explained at all)\nhas no plan B (if I may expand any decent proposal presents alternatives, preferably a well thought out range of options)\ndidn’t even know which brownfield sites it owned\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this. I think Peterborough should be enthusiastically refusing to reduce its tenanted farm land holdings.\nOnce Paul Stainton said they were starting to wind up and I still hadn’t succeeding in asking any of my questions I decided that since I wasn’t actually required as a speaking participant, as I had expected, I wasn’t going to be part of any awful preorganised tedious windbag wind up. So I left and expressed my feelings as clearly as I possibly could (being at that point absolutely livid) to David Murray, radio editor.\nSo what questions would I have asked? I had two: the first was in response to Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative). I wanted to ask him (and I’ll be honest I really wanted to ask this in front of a rolling TV camera):\nCan you explain why you are not sure exactly how much income the solar voltaic array on the Freemans building is bringing in and why should anyone trust your figures if you are in the slightest bit uncertain on this point?\nAnd the other one was to Stewart Jackson. I wanted to ask him:\nWhether or not public authorities (including Peterborough City Council) don’t have to disclose to our elected representative in parliament whatever information is requested of them and to confirm that he does actually have all the figures because he has asked the city council for them and they have been obliged to disclose them.\nThe Green Backyard and Metal welcome Robin Grey and Laura Burns to present an incredible evening of stories, song, sustenance and struggle as we delve into the history of the land beneath your feet.\nJoin us to explore the often forgotten past of enclosure, privatisation and dispossession of land-based communities, and hear the vibrant histories of struggle and resistance that emerged when people rose up and confronted the loss of their lands, cultures and ways of life.\nThese multiple histories go largely undocumented in the literature of the times, yet in the music and stories of the people they take on a different life. Join us for an evening delving into this history through folk songs and stories right up to the present day. Come and share in these tales as they have been shared for generations.\nThe evening will also feature words from local poet Keely Mills and Green Backyard Co-Founder Sophie Antonelli, focusing the tales of what has gone before on our present lives and land here in Peterborough.\nIncluded in the entry price is a delicious meal of home-cooked and locally grown food, and there will also be a licensed bar operating from the venue.\nVenue: Chauffeurs Cottage, St Peter’s Road, PE1 1YX (behind Peterborough Town Hall ) Tickets: £12\nYou can buy your tickets from the The Green Backyard, Rams Fair Meadow Allotment Site, London Rd, Peterborough, PE2 8AT on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday,11am – 4pm, or from Chauffeurs Cottage Monday – Friday between 10am – 5pm.\nAll proceeds from this event will go towards the Save the The Green Backyard fund, saving our community green space from demolition and bringing it back into community ownership.\nThis evening Cllr Darren Fower proposed a motion at Full Council. The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.\nIrena Radić will present a programme of pieces by Scarlatti, Beethoven, Scriabin and Poulenc at a free piano recital at St Peter’s & St Paul’s Church in Uppingham at 1:30pm, on Wednesday 3rd July.\nIrena Radić is currently preparing for her Piano Diploma at the Royal College of Music Junior Department, where she is a Tsukanov scholar, studying piano with Lynette Stulting.

Again. Check out the last frame!\nTo the best of my knowledge Clerk of Works is currently not a role within the organisation structure of Peterborough City Council (I can’t find the role on their website). Happy as always to be corrected.\nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST – FOI-14-0299 A1139 Fletton Parkway\nAlthough it looks from this document as if there were “site supervision and clerk of works functions” identified, it is clear that one contractor to the council appointed another contractor to the contractor to perform the roles. This is not the same as having one qualified person on one’s own team and begs the question who the possibly qualified person was. Happy as always to be corrected.\nIf Clerk of Works is the role which secures budgetary control (see above video), why isn’t Morson (the contractor apparently covering the role) picking up 100% of the £4.5M cost overrun? One way to establish the reason for this would be to subject the relevant contracts and subcontracts to scrutiny by a person competent in law of contract.\nPersonally, if I were the council I’d bring the role of Clerk of Works straight back in-house to establish and secure a clear line of responsibility and management. A good properly qualified person in this role could save the city a fortune over time. I know that breathtaking achievements (even if you only count the beans) are often made, quietly and without a brass band, by people doing this sort of job for other organisations.\nInformation on the history of the role of Clerk of Works within Peterborough City Council’s remit very welcome.",

Those with any hearing difficulties at all struggled, even when listening to those around the same table. The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available.

He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked. Something has to be very seriously wrong: when nobody\nunderstands the process\nbothers to explain it\nknows what it is or\nwhy it is there\nWhy does nobody ever challenge this preposterous pile of garbage? If someone fly-tipped vomit soaked nappies all over Cllr Nick Sandford (Liberal Democrat), would he actually mind? I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\nlack of transparency (no figures available to the residents of Peterborough and – because I couldn’t ask my second question the audience was able to rest secure in the assumption – to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) himself.\ntreatment of farmers (I’ll expand for him here: the council’s first communication to 18 farmers was to warn them that they would be evicted if the plan went ahead)\nrisk of a change in the subsidy regime: no safety plan if the government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) changes the regime governing ROCs (again no discussion: no explanation)\nno contingency fund if the sums are wrong\nconflict with government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) policy on renewables (this was not explained at all)\nhas no plan B (if I may expand any decent proposal presents alternatives, preferably a well thought out range of options)\ndidn’t even know which brownfield sites it owned\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this. I think Peterborough should be enthusiastically refusing to reduce its tenanted farm land holdings.\nOnce Paul Stainton said they were starting to wind up and I still hadn’t succeeding in asking any of my questions I decided that since I wasn’t actually required as a speaking participant, as I had expected, I wasn’t going to be part of any awful preorganised tedious windbag wind up. So I left and expressed my feelings as clearly as I possibly could (being at that point absolutely livid) to David Murray, radio editor.\nSo what questions would I have asked? I had two: the first was in response to Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative). I wanted to ask him (and I’ll be honest I really wanted to ask this in front of a rolling TV camera):\nCan you explain why you are not sure exactly how much income the solar voltaic array on the Freemans building is bringing in and why should anyone trust your figures if you are in the slightest bit uncertain on this point?\nAnd the other one was to Stewart Jackson. I wanted to ask him:\nWhether or not public authorities (including Peterborough City Council) don’t have to disclose to our elected representative in parliament whatever information is requested of them and to confirm that he does actually have all the figures because he has asked the city council for them and they have been obliged to disclose them.\nThe Green Backyard and Metal welcome Robin Grey and Laura Burns to present an incredible evening of stories, song, sustenance and struggle as we delve into the history of the land beneath your feet.\nJoin us to explore the often forgotten past of enclosure, privatisation and dispossession of land-based communities, and hear the vibrant histories of struggle and resistance that emerged when people rose up and confronted the loss of their lands, cultures and ways of life.\nThese multiple histories go largely undocumented in the literature of the times, yet in the music and stories of the people they take on a different life. Join us for an evening delving into this history through folk songs and stories right up to the present day. Come and share in these tales as they have been shared for generations.\nThe evening will also feature words from local poet Keely Mills and Green Backyard Co-Founder Sophie Antonelli, focusing the tales of what has gone before on our present lives and land here in Peterborough.\nIncluded in the entry price is a delicious meal of home-cooked and locally grown food, and there will also be a licensed bar operating from the venue.\nVenue: Chauffeurs Cottage, St Peter’s Road, PE1 1YX (behind Peterborough Town Hall ) Tickets: £12\nYou can buy your tickets from the The Green Backyard, Rams Fair Meadow Allotment Site, London Rd, Peterborough, PE2 8AT on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday,11am – 4pm, or from Chauffeurs Cottage Monday – Friday between 10am – 5pm.\nAll proceeds from this event will go towards the Save the The Green Backyard fund, saving our community green space from demolition and bringing it back into community ownership.\nThis evening Cllr Darren Fower proposed a motion at Full Council. The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.\nIrena Radić will present a programme of pieces by Scarlatti, Beethoven, Scriabin and Poulenc at a free piano recital at St Peter’s & St Paul’s Church in Uppingham at 1:30pm, on Wednesday 3rd July.\nIrena Radić is currently preparing for her Piano Diploma at the Royal College of Music Junior Department, where she is a Tsukanov scholar, studying piano with Lynette Stulting. She is also studying for her A levels at The Kings School in Peterborough. http://www.kings.peterborough.sch.uk/news/?pid=5&nid=3&storyid=42",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_waste-management_page_2/content_219.html": "Tag: waste management\nMini Sit-in at Call-in\nLast night the committee with a very long name about which I have blogged previously met again, this time to consider a Call-In Request. It met to decide whether or not to call-in the decision made by Deputy Leader Councillor Matthew Lee (CONSERVATIVE) to make Viridor the preferred bidder to run the council’s planned incinerator (Lot 1).\nThe members of this committee are:\n- Councillor Marion Todd (Chairman)\n- Councillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman)\n- Councillor Mohammed Nadeem\n- Councillor Yasmeen Maqbool\n- Councillor Stuart Martin\n- Councillor Nick Thulbourn\n- Councillor Judy Fox\n- Councillor Dale McKean (Reserve)\n- Councillor Lisa Forbes (Reserve)\n- Councillor Chris Ash (Reserve) (source: Peterborough City Council)\nCllr Maqbool had given advance notice of her absence and Cllr Dale McKean attended in her place.\nAt the end of about four hours of lengthy, soporific, off topic but occasionally revelatory proceedings the committee decided 4 to 3 to reject the request for a call-in.\nVoted AGAINST calling in the decision (and therefore supporting Cllr Lee’s decision)\nCouncillor Marion Todd (Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Mohammed Nadeem CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Dale McKean (Reserve) CONSERVATIVE\nVoted FOR calling in the decision (and supporting reference back to Full Council or decision maker, but unable to vote for either option since the other vote took place first)\nCouncillor Stuart Martin LABOUR\nCouncillor Nick Thulbourn LABOUR\nCouncillor Judy Fox INDEPENDENT\nThe meeting began at 6pm with Apologies and Declaration of Interests. No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.\nCo-minglers might have to prove quality of result\nA number of local authorities, including Peterborough co-mingle recyclables in a single collection.\nOther authorities collect each recyclable item separately.\nIn 2008 this was demonstrated to be better value, since the end product is more likely to fetch a good price.\nThe Campaign for Real Recycling is challenging the asssumption so far made:\nthat co-mingled collections of paper, metal, plastics and glass produces a quality result.\nhttp://www.realrecycling.org.uk/news/news39.php\nA judicial review hearing will be held in Cardiff, starting on 14th December 2011.\nPeterborough for Responsible Waste Management fights for good quality recycling.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_news_page_3/content_490.html": "If you feel someone is doing a magnificent job, you can use the same page to pay a compliment, or you may even want to know how to offer someone your support.\nA first impression of the BBC’s breaking news coverage of the Rochdale Review commissioned by Andy Burnham\nPurely by chance I tuned in over breakfast to BBC News where the Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Stephen Watson was in the middle of apologising for the force’s shortcomings in dealing with reports of child abuse in Rochdale. He was responding to ‘the Mayor‘s review’ or, to give it its full name, ‘The review into Operation Span and the investigation of non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’ which has just been published. The next speaker was Rochdale Council leader Councillor Neil Emmott, the leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, who also apologised for what the council had got wrong.\nNext came three women, each of whom had headed up an organisation working with the thousands of (mostly female and very young) victims of human trafficking and sexual abuse. (nobody’s names came up from start to finish). The first woman had been through the barrier known as the end of one’s tether, her hair got in her way, and she was gasping for air and needed water, but she was clearly a warrior and won my respect for getting out in short order the horrible truths she needed to speak.\nThe second woman was wearing a very smart cream dress and had her hair and make up done: full Manchester female in armour, elegantly equipped equally for the dance floor, lifting someone up out of the gutter, or take her presentation to any board room or civic assembly rooms of the city prepared to listen to what goes on in the darkest corners of the city: where corruption, physical, emotional and psychological abuse and the systemic collusion of letting offenders go: the institutional joint enterprise (how come that is not an offence, she asks?) of deliberately letting known and identified criminals walk free.\nShe struck a line through the whole of the older Oldham predecessor report, revealing that during that investigation, only one victim had been able to speak to the reviewers. It’s people like her I want to see working where they can do what is needed: in the House of Lords.\nThen, just as the third woman, in a dark suit began speaking, she was rudely interrupted by a far more important man: Grant Schapps, talking about the state of the world and threats had multiplied and increased in severity during the horrible reign of his own ghastly Tory Party. I have no idea what the third woman wanted to say.\nHow dare the BBC cut this third woman short? They had three channels they could have used. BBC1, BBC2 and BBCNews. The handling of this press release was outrageous. Instead 10 Downing St was able to shut up a woman speaking on matters of concern to every woman and child and every decent man in the UK.\nI think I might have to complain to the BBC. Three news channels.\nWhat happened to the third woman’s voice, please?\nCan anyone figure out where the broadcast continued?\nWho has broadcast what she said, please?\nMeanwhile, I search for Rochdale report on Youtube and, depressingly, I find:\nThe Nene is in flood, still transporting last summer and autumn’s above average rainfall to the Wash and new steadily heavy El Niño winter rain. Since my third update the Conservative administration at Peterborough City Council has been toppled and a well intentioned but inexperienced ex opposition multi party Cabinet is trying to keep the council’s finances afloat and to fix whatever has been going wrong. The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?\nHow to get Santa back when his arrival down your chimney is threatened by UK Government Diktat. Could two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nAll children need to be told about this appalling story broken by Newsthump. Sit them down after they’ve had a good meal and read it as gently and softly as you can. Just before bed with the lights down. Don’t forget right at the end of this absolutely terrible story, to remind them that they are not allowed to vote for a change of government until they turn 18. But they can register to vote to change matters they disapprove of as soon as they turn 17.\nYour children might react by telling you not to be so silly, close their eyes and sleep, much as so often happens when you read one of the ghastliest and grimmest of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nBut if they sit up and protest against your bedtime story, here is how to suggest that they run a poll at their school. Younger doubters may ask for another story: this can’t after all, be how it all ends? Maybe an Adventure is in order? Or a Game? Tomorrow night, then.\nChildren can always run a Poll\nAt their School, Club in the Family or anywhere where there are three or more people who can be persuaded to join in. They will need to appoint an Electoral Returning Officer to run a Poll or even an Internal Election. A boring school would appoint a teacher to this role. But this would avoid about two weeks work for a whole school who could Research, Discuss, Decide and Vote on making their own Elected Officer or Appointment (could be either) from within the class (for a class poll) or a school (for a school wide poll). They’d also need to Decide (and how to do that) whether or not they can Vote in an Assembly (like Parliament) or whether they need a full scale Election, in which case they would need to Design and Manufacture their own Poll Cards, Ballot Boxes and Confidential Polling Booths, Specify the Dates and Times the Booths would be open and then Decide how to Organise the Count: Appoint Polling Staff, Appoint Counting Staff. They’d also have to Decide on the Definition of the Electorate (or determine an Electoral Boundary) and whether or not they need to Register Eligible Voters on an Electoral Register. Oh yes, they’d have to Decide on a Wording to be put on the Ballot and whether or not more than one Vote can be taken and if so, how. And whether or not a Simple Majority is the best Voting Strategy.\nThey could each run a Vote Count to find out who or what Motion has won the Poll. Offences Detected and Offences Not Detected could also be counted, by each of the smaller teams.\nTo make this slightly less deadly (nobody is pretending all this is super exciting!) for older and very bright students, maybe those with lively imaginations and career options including Crime Writer, you could have one small additional group working in a Vote Fraud Team (their Objective could be to Manipulate the Vote by whatever Illegal Means they can Concoct) and another small additional group working as an Electoral Police, working to Detect Electoral Offences. This is not recommended for children under the age of 14, who generally adhere to the Right and Wrong Theory of Everything.\nParticipants who don’t understand the Capitalised Words (there are even a couple in this Post’s Heading!) will find them Defined in Wikipedia.\nCould two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nWell, Arguably they could. Because a teacher who asks a class to Vote FOR or AGAINST an idea by asking for a Show of Hands can run a Poll in about forty seconds flat. Although, of course, that hyper efficient teacher’s class may never grasp the finer points of how elections are run (and policed) by UK governments and UK law enforcement.\nThe monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nPark Ward votes against the trend\nPark Ward gifts Prime Minister Rishi Sunak half his morning after soundbites\nBy the morning after the election, it was already clear that the Conservatives were heading for an enormous number of local election defeats. For their Chairman “good” would have been keeping that number to just one thousand. They failed. And lost many more seats than that. The monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nBut, against this trend, in Park Ward two Conservatives were elected.\nThe result for Park Ward is interesting and in voting in two Conservatives, the ward went clean against the trend in the rest of the UK, which has so far (result in Redcar & Cleveland still to come in) seen the Conservatives net a loss of 1,058 seats.\nIn Park, Conservative candidate Arfan Khan came first and will serve the ward as city councillor for four years.\nConservative Muhammad Asif, on the other hand will serve a term of only one year, since by coming second, he won the seat vacated by ex Councillor Shaz Nawaz when he resigned, and whose term would have expired in 2024.\nMost people I canvassed were very keen not to see the Conservatives take Park. A huge number of people also know that it was a Conservative led council combined with many years of Conservative national governments which have brought the city to its current crisis, a council close to bankruptcy, many residents unable to provide themselves with food or heat indoors and as soon as you step outside the unmistakeable signs of neglect, deprivation and disempowerment are unavoidable.\nA Conservative win therefore baffles many people, including me, frankly. So what happened, how, and why?\nIs it a personal, rather than a party vote\nIn Arfan Khan’s case, his vote is a personal one and, I strongly suspect, nothing to do with which party he stood for.\nArfan Khan is an individual who commands great personal affection and respect in the community he serves as a funeral director.\nIs it a pragmatic, rather than a party vote\nThe Moslem community is currently trying to deal with issues at current burial sites and is keen to establish (a) new burial ground(s) in or near Peterborough and these campaigns will be more significant for many voters than any and all the goings on in Westminster.\nI can’t speak for or about Muhammad Asif, except to observe that, on the basis of his speech at the Park Ward hustings, he seems agreeable: mild and quietly spoken.\nWas Labour’s collapse more extreme in Park\nIn Park Ward, the resignation of the Labour Group Leader, ex Councillor Nawaz and the last minute resignation of ex Councillor Ikra Yasin prior to the elections will inevitably have damaged Labour’s chances in the ward, necessitating as they did, a last minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign. It is possible that the degree of Labour Party turbulence in Peterborough and especially in Park Ward is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Conventional wisdom would suggest that by this stage in the parliamentary electoral cycle, and with the current disgrace-inclined government, Labour should be able to wipe the board. Its supporters are angry that it isn’t taking opportunities when they are available. Labour could have taken control of Peterborough City Council, had it been allowed to work with other opposition councillors. As it is, Labour remains the hardest party to work with for the Greens (not just here), however helpful individual councillors might be.\nSo far, so good: these elements may be more or less peculiar to Park Ward. But I think most of the residents of the ward – and beyond – will still be bewildered that the Conservatives now hold two of the three city council seats representing residents in the ward. This is very clear in comments on Facebook.\nDefections to the Green Party\nBut the turmoil in Labour is worth returning to, since it has affected Peterborough’s Green election campaigns beyond Park Ward – and beyond Peterborough – too.\nPeterborough Greens (in common with Greens elsewhere in the country) have benefitted this year by the defections from Labour to our party of two excellent councillors. Bright Green published an article about this phenomenon. Unfortunately only one of ours (Cllr Heather Skibstead) succeeded in retaining her seat in Peterborough (which was Orton Longueville): she had more months and more of her own free time in which to communicate in advance of the election with her ward’s residents. However, her success represents a national first for the Green Party and we here as well as the party at large are delighted and very proud of this achievement.\nIt is really important for a political party to be able to manage post defection retention elections well. I’d like the Green Party to be a good place for good hard working conscientious councillors who’d much rather be with us, to defect to. Lots of councillors hang on in a political party they don’t really like, putting up with things they despise only because they know that being on your own and going independent is so risky. It makes sense that we work together to make it less risky to transfer a prior party allegiance to the Green Party. If you are reading this and are considering making such a step: please talk to us confidentially well in advance.\nWhen minus one equals plus one\nOddly, Heather’s retaining her seat counts as a GAIN for the Greens (even though as far as we were concerned, she was already a Green Party councillor), because the press compares the results of this with those of the previous election, which is guaranteed to confuse anyone not following things at this level of detail.\nThe second defector to our ranks this year was ex Cllr Imtiaz Ali. His arrival resulted in our biggest yet Green group of four on the council and I am sorry for him as well as for the group that he didn’t retain his Fletton & Woodston seat in this election. It would have been nearly if not impossible to win it, given the very short timescale available to his campaign.\nOnce again, despite losing Cllr Imtiaz Ali from our Green group on the council, Greens in Peterborough are reported in the media as having gained one councillor for the same confusing reasons. So despite gaining one, this picture on the council’s website on the day of the election, will soon reduce down to three councillors.\nBeyond all this excitement and a little further away in Orton Waterville, Councillor Nicola Day campaigned calmly and steadily to retain her seat and her campaign’s approach was rewarded with a huge margin of success, helping to entrench Orton Waterville’s reputation locally as an exceptionally well represented and very-happy-to-be-Green ward.\nThank you\nThis campaign has been truly extraordinary.\nThe achievement of Cllr Kirsty Knight in supporting members of another party getting used to Green ways of working cannot be overstated. This (as with many of her other roles) is not easy. Thank you Kirsty.\nIn this election our campaign teams have attempted more than ever before. Thank you for your votes. I have never received so many messages of support. I have never worked alongside so many volunteers and helpers. Our councillor team and our election team are quite simply, awesome. The reception candidates have received on doorsteps has been amazing and I feel that voters in Peterborough get us, at last. What we are, what we do, how we do it, and what we are capable of is just beginning to be understood. We are beginning to be seen, rather than described by outside hostile voices. The objectives we set ourselves are difficult and it is even more difficult to take people with us on these journeys, but I for one no longer feel I am on my own: there are people I have never met personally coming along beside me, who see me immediately they open their front door. I’d like to thank everyone who has appreciated us and lent us a hand during this campaign. We could not have achieved a fraction of what we have without such magnificent commitment and support. I hope you have enjoyed it and got something out of it as well. Thank you.\nreaders of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might explain the late declaration.\nThursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late.As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph. (Please note that the second and fourth articles have subsequently been updated.)\nThe third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am.\nWhy did huge Photo ID queues build up so late on election night?\nAs a candidate, my job on election night is to wait for the ballot box to come in and to be present at the count. This is how candidates respect the voter’s voice. The ballot box contains the ballots and on their ballot papers are the choices of voters, speaking and expressing their wishes on the one day they are allowed to vote. Candidates observe their counts. We see what they say.\nThe first of Park Ward’s ballot boxes (Madeley House polling station) came in in reasonable time. The second ballot box (All Saints polling station) came in very late indeed, apparently owing to a long queue building up due to the Photo ID check. Queue tickets were issued to those in the queue at 10pm. This was clearly not expected to be a big thing by polling staff, who, when I left them had already been on duty for thirteen and a half hours, with only on-site breaks. The third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am. I do not know how long polling staff had been at their posts by the time they were discharged from their duties, nor in what state they were. Polling staff are not permitted to leave the polling station while they are on duty and although they are all prepared for a 15 -16 hour shift, which is already an outrageously long working day, they certainly do not expect to be on duty very much beyond 10pm. I am wondering how many polling staff had to endure a 20 hour working day extending beyond Thursday 4th May into the early hours of the 5th.\nIt is true that PhotoID was trialled. But the very small trials were failures.\nUK government implemented the legislation despite the pilots’ failures.\nBallot boxes are normally handed over to the transport soon after 10pm and will usually arrive about an hour later. This year Peterborough City Council could not afford huge numbers of high security transit vehicles (the trucks looked like refrigerated container trucks) so some polling station staff at the eighty polling stations open at this year’s local election (there will be more polling stations for next year’s elections) will have had to wait for one of the five trucks waiting for a hold up somewhere else. I do not know how many polling stations were impacted by delays occurring in Park Ward. Nor do I know if other wards were themselves affected by late long queues.\nI cannot physically be in two places at once and all my team was already with me at the Town Hall. So, what I want to know is exactly what happened at the All Saints and St Georges polling stations. The advice I was given by polling staff was that the dinner time rush which usually starts between 5pm and 6pm was already dying down. Something clearly changed from the ward’s normal voting behaviour. How come? Why did such long queues form so late in the voting window?\nWere you in one of the queues? Please describe what happened.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements to cycling and walking routes.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.",

This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough. What do you think?\nMeanwhile thank you to Blue Watch at Dogsthorpe Fire Station for helping today!",

This is an extraordinary standoff, given that a river is a highly dynamic entity, with carving into land and carrying it away away its favourite and constant sport. The embankment constitutes its urban restraint. Wouldn’t it make sense to fix the damage first and then sort out who owed how much in the courts? A few days ago I went to see whether or not the crack had been repaired I found a larger crack than I expected. Close up, the embankment undulates as if there’d been an earthquake or a landslip. A sort of fountain of subsoil sits at could conceivably be the source of the damage (if it got there by being thrust up right out of the ground). It is as if if water got stuck somewhere and had to burst up through what is a remarkably deep layer of tarmac. And guess what is growing just where that pile of subsoil is? Yes. Tomatoes. Of course, they could have been planted in an apartment garden. But wild tomatoes are common in the UK and they are celebrated self seeders. They can be spotted growing happily along railway tracks and wherever human manure distributes their tiny tell tale seeds. So my question is, given Anglian Water’s discovery of a major sewer works scandal not so very far away, at the junction of Wentworth Street and Bourges Boulevard this July (also reported to the council and in our local paper), has Anglian Water investigated whether or not something equally stinky might lurk beneath Peterborough embankment’s spectacular crack? Could damage to, neglect of, a blockage in or a fault in the drains cause damage on this scale? Or, conversely, could the crack have damaged a foul drain, enabling a tell tale seed or two to escape? After all, what force is there, other than water, capable of taking the huge corrugated steel retaining wall holding the embankment in place and bending it out of true? I’m no expert, but I can see that the embankment wall is not vertical any more. My theories about water transporting sewage carrying tomato seeds and pushing steel walls around might both be fanciful. But if anyone has a more sensible explanation, do tell.\nIs that a clue in that crack?\nTomatoes grow on Peterborough’s embankment",

It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?\nA succession of disappointing Conservative governments have left the UK with an extraordinary number of groups with very substantial grievances. One group consists of about 3,800,000 women who were born in the 50s.\nI was. Were you?\nIf not, you’ll know a few. Please support the campaign for full restitution to UK women born in the 1950’s. Please share this post and please join me. I have taken these two simple actions:\nJoin me and write to your MP Explain to your MP what this increase in pension age has meant to you. Check first whether or not your MP has already signed in support of EDM 243 The motion is “That this House welcomes the positive interventions from so many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have suffered pensions loss through the targeting of their pension rights; pays tribute to constituents and campaigners in their ongoing fight for justice; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory laws; and encourages the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to join mediation, noting there are no impediments to doing so.” If your MP hasn’t, please, when you write, ask your MP to sign EDM 24.\nNothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nAs if Voter ID wasn’t enough, this year brings a new voting complication\nVoters delivering their votes by hand to the Town Hall may be surprised this year by the notices stapled to the doors warning them NOT to post their ballots in the Town Hall letter box without a “return form”. This is a new rule! A new form! Nothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nThe government has added yet another risk to voting postally. There are others, including postal delivery delays (extremely big risk at the moment), rejection of ballot due to signature or date not being matched (very small risk in my opinion, but still a risk), mislaying the pack from the council, theft of the pack or the ballot paper from someone who is vulnerable, someone who is being bullied, or someone who doesn’t understand or care (very big risk indeed).\nIncidentally, it is forbidden for candidates to handle anyone else’s postal packs or ballots. They should only ever handle their own. If a candidate or anyone you don’t trust completely offers to take your vote for you, please report it. You might be experiencing a crime and the council will check it out for you.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: it doesn’t look any better than it smells.\nThames Water’s creditors face a massive haircut if this Conservative government decides, despite its Conservative privatisation ideology, that it turns out to be the best organisation to put right the very stinky mess which Conservative deregulated private business ideologies seem to have combined to let of a utility company make.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: this doesn’t look any better than it smells, unless you happen to be a bond trader with money to flush.\nMeanwhile, global temperatures carry on breaking records. March was the eleventh consecutive month in which global sea and air temperatures broke records.\nWhy does voting independent in Park Ward makes sense this year? Because what I said in my address to voters last year remains true this year: Park Ward has exactly the same problems. But this year we have even more challenges and we need to start by describing them honestly.\nLast year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nBig Bins – outside flats and shops\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nHealth & Education services struggle with residents who move\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nResources for Roads\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.\nThis year I am standing as an independent candidate in Peterborough\nPolice and Crime Commissioner, Peterborough City Council and several parish council elections will be held on Thursday 2nd May. But this time, I am standing in Park Ward as an independent politician. This means that I can set my own campaign priorities and ignore group think and party lines. If elected, I would be free to vote only for those policies and decisions which would improve the lives of my constituents and which I personally agreed with.\nI supported Councillor Kirsty Knight’s successful Green Party campaigns last year. This year she is fighting to retain her seat for the first time as an independent councillor. This takes great courage and I respect her hugely for her decision. I endorse, am supporting, and will continue to support Kirsty after what I very much hope will be another victory and another campaign first. Please vote for and support Kirsty, who in her first term has already established herself as an outstanding city councillor.\nCollette Francis (who campaigned energetically for the Bretton Oak Tree and joined the Greens) is also standing in West as an independent candidate. As a serving parish councillor interested and competent in paperwork and planning, I am confident Collette will make a superb city councillor. Please vote for and support Collette.\nLastly, thank you to all those who have helped and tried to help during the past few months. I have heard every word and I appreciate all you have done and said. Thank you.\nPlease get in touch to support my campaigns, or those of Collette or Kirsty\nWho is observing, and who is maybe not even noticing the visible and costly effects of climate change in Peterborough? A clue might have landed on your doormat.\nI walked through Central Park recently and realised that nearly every single box had died. I took a couple of photos intending to write to the council and promptly forgot.\nThen, thanks to Angus Ellis I received a useful reminder. Thank you, Angus.\nThe reminder arrived in the form of a Labour and Co-operative Party leaflet suggesting I vote for Angus who is this party’s candidate in Park Ward. It dropped on my doormat and I eventually got round to reading it. I discovered a very rare picture of Park Ward Councillor Mohammed Samir (who, along with another Ravensthorpe councillor is not profligate with his words or his image) at the bottom right of page three. And even more surprising, there, in front of his frown and rising up the bank behind him is scorched, brown and dead or dying box hedging, telling every sharp eyed reader in Park Ward the very sad story about its own highly likely extinction.\nWeather conditions are increasingly brutal and this pattern of intemperate weather (part of our new, not so temperate climate) is particularly cruel to box, a key evergreen parks and gardens hedging plant. Long periods of extreme drought alternating with non stop record rainfall will have stressed this along with many other plants, including many of Central Park’s trees.\nSlowly, since 2007 when it was first recorded in the UK, the box moth has been travelling north (it began its very long journey somewhere in South East Asia!) and here it is: rampaging across Peterborough. It noticed it in my garden only last summer. It probably reached the park before that.\nI wrote to the council this morning to ask that the dead box bushes are dug out. A very sad job for those who tended them. It used to be good gardening practice to burn diseased and infested plants. These days, hot composting (we have brown garden bins for that in Peterborough) will probably do the job of disinfection.\nI have also been thinking about what needs doing in Central Park to deal with the loss of the lovely robust evergreen structure which the box has provided for many years around Central Park’s beds and along paths. Evergreens are particularly important in winter, when so many plants are bare.\nReplacement structural evergreen hedging can’t be planted safely in Spring or Summer (October is the very earliest sensible time) and until then at the earliest, removing dead plants will open the beds up to unwanted foot traffic: both pet and human.\nFast growing decorative annual flowers might have time to provide protective ground cover until a decision is made on whether and how to replace.\nI would be very surprised if there is one plant which could do what the extraordinary and now at risk box did for all the park’s flower beds, since the conditions in each bed are increasingly varied: some are very very dry (memorial gardens) and others around the outer path are shady and one or two occasionally waterlogged. Decisions could be complicated.\nSeeding with forget-me-not (on damper beds) and/or nasturtium (round the top of the dry memorial garden).\nAnd if a decision is made to retain hedge type edging, which plants might work well in the various conditions to be found in different beds around the park?\nI think that rosemary might work around the memorial garden. It doesn’t mind neglect and drought and responds to drought by flowering (all year round!!) if dry. It doesn’t mind being on a bank which will lose rainwater. It can be clipped (min twice a year) into a very beautiful and sturdy box type hedge. But it probably shouldn’t go in straight away: there will be too much box moth around and it’s definitely a second choice target!\nA first impression of the BBC’s breaking news coverage of the Rochdale Review commissioned by Andy Burnham\nPurely by chance I tuned in over breakfast to BBC News where the Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Stephen Watson was in the middle of apologising for the force’s shortcomings in dealing with reports of child abuse in Rochdale. He was responding to ‘the Mayor‘s review’ or, to give it its full name, ‘The review into Operation Span and the investigation of non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’ which has just been published. The next speaker was Rochdale Council leader Councillor Neil Emmott, the leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, who also apologised for what the council had got wrong.\nNext came three women, each of whom had headed up an organisation working with the thousands of (mostly female and very young) victims of human trafficking and sexual abuse. (nobody’s names came up from start to finish). The first woman had been through the barrier known as the end of one’s tether, her hair got in her way, and she was gasping for air and needed water, but she was clearly a warrior and won my respect for getting out in short order the horrible truths she needed to speak.\nThe second woman was wearing a very smart cream dress and had her hair and make up done: full Manchester female in armour, elegantly equipped equally for the dance floor, lifting someone up out of the gutter, or take her presentation to any board room or civic assembly rooms of the city prepared to listen to what goes on in the darkest corners of the city: where corruption, physical, emotional and psychological abuse and the systemic collusion of letting offenders go: the institutional joint enterprise (how come that is not an offence, she asks?) of deliberately letting known and identified criminals walk free.\nShe struck a line through the whole of the older Oldham predecessor report, revealing that during that investigation, only one victim had been able to speak to the reviewers. It’s people like her I want to see working where they can do what is needed: in the House of Lords.\nThen, just as the third woman, in a dark suit began speaking, she was rudely interrupted by a far more important man: Grant Schapps, talking about the state of the world and threats had multiplied and increased in severity during the horrible reign of his own ghastly Tory Party. I have no idea what the third woman wanted to say.\nHow dare the BBC cut this third woman short? They had three channels they could have used. BBC1, BBC2 and BBCNews. The handling of this press release was outrageous. Instead 10 Downing St was able to shut up a woman speaking on matters of concern to every woman and child and every decent man in the UK.\nI think I might have to complain to the BBC. Three news channels.\nWhat happened to the third woman’s voice, please?\nCan anyone figure out where the broadcast continued?\nWho has broadcast what she said, please?\nMeanwhile, I search for Rochdale report on Youtube and, depressingly, I find:",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_green_page_2/content_154.html": "There’s a Hole in your Logic\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nLet’s look at what Fiona Onasanya has had to say on electoral reform. A quick google search produces no comments on electoral reform (except where her name comes up alongside mine!). (Beki Sellick: very similar). As for Stewart Jackson: he has voted against electoral reform or been absent on every available occasion.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nGiven the maths, I don’t rate Labour’s chances in Peterborough at all. I don’t think Lisa Forbes thought she stood a hope either. There is only one candidate who could have swung it, in my opinion: the one who won) in the Peterborough area in the PCC election in 2012.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\nI hope this letter helps to minimise that risk.\nUseful links:\ntactical2017.com #Tactical2017\nTimeline:\n25/4/17 11:26 LAB 2015 candidate regrets she can’t stand in June 2017\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n29/4/17 12:50 UKIP announces it won’t field a candidate\n2/5/17 11:54 Greens announce their Peterborough (& NWC) selection results\n2/5/17 23:34 LAB reveal Fiona Onasanya is their Peterborough candidate\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_page-not-found/content_699.html": "My intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough. What do you think?\nMeanwhile thank you to Blue Watch at Dogsthorpe Fire Station for helping today!",

But last night I slept that dark recovery sleep which comes night after night when you have been sleep deprived for a long time. Like Guinness. Dark and deep. No images. But something important got stitched together in the night. As I swung out of bed I knew exactly why I had got so cross yesterday about the livestream being cancelled during the hustings at the St Johns Hustings on Tuesday. Anger is never a good thing, but it is the most important directional kick and motivator available. Incredibly powerful. Understanding it and reflecting on it matters: I always try to do that. I was puzzling about my feelings when I went to bed. But it took a whole night’s sleep to alert me to what had made me incandescent with fury yesterday.\nI’d been looking in the wrong place for the answer.\nLast night’s sleep brought me back to another painful memory. I am very aware of other candidates’ emotions: I’ve been upset several times. The way candidates are treated is very important. One party leader at the Tuesday railed against his candidate’s exclusion from the platform. I couldn’t help but sympathise. Candidates need so much support and help in doing what they try to do. It is impossible not to see the hurt and pain which they encounter on the way. During the night two memories of anger and a feeling of me personally being badly let down connected themselves together. I’d been reflecting on yet another occasion (yes standing for election is full of drama and high emotion!), but of course: it wasn’t that occasion which mattered.\nNearly the same thing happened before. Of course it did. I was told years ago at another hustings that a professional recording would be made and that it would be broadcast but it never was. My performance on the platform was pretty awful. But the broken promise was what mattered to and hurt me.\nThat’s why I was nearly incoherent yesterday on Twitter. Do go and have a look. https://twitter.com/FionaRadic\nThis morning I am calm. I realise this is a rerun of what has happened before. There is a pattern. The murderer of tracks may have struck before.\nThe trouble with getting upset about things is that you can’t always confront the actual problem so you embalm it in a better buried place in your consciousness in order to “move on”. This is especially true if you are a directly affected and traumatised candidate. But as it happens, this week I have a huge advantage. I am not the candidate. True I am in recovery from having been the candidate in two very exciting and over close together elections. But I am deliciously and delightfully free of the specific challenges which every candidates faces: including having to put a lot of very important things on one side in order to deal with the urgent things. And I can sleep. I am looking after another candidate. But I am not him. I can reflect. I can think. Bliss.\nA high level of disappointment between what was promised at an event and what is delivered is why I now go equipped with a camera and even a crew if I can assemble one and try to report on the event as well as perform (when I am a candidate) at a hustings. Of course this is entirely because it has happened before. My behaviour is totally conditioned by the occasion which sleep brought back to me. I’d somehow excluded it from my thoughts yesterday even though it was the causative event of my current behaviour. You can only know what it is like to do both jobs if you’ve done it. Candidates shouldn’t need to perform as candidates and as reporter. Multiple reasons why not, including obvious bias.\nIt isn’t an accident that I’ve never been elected. For me that is never, has never been the most important thing. A functioning democracy is far more important to me. I was aware when I started my blog things didn’t work properly in Peterborough.\nWell here’s a very important example of things going utterly wrong. If you have an election, voters need to see the candidates as soon as possible so that they can make as good a decision as they possibly can.\nAnything which supports that process is contributing to the workings of democracy. Huge numbers of people not directly involved in the party political processes help the democratic process to work as well as it can. They often don’t get a thank you. The vast majority get absolutely nothing in return. We need more of them and they need to be supported and feel far more empowered.\nAnything or anyone which obstructs that needs to be identified and exposed.\nNobody and nothing should have had the power to murder the livestream on Tuesday. The host of an event is in charge and a candidate at a public event is in a public place. So how was that even possible?\nSo today I’ve decided to stop yelling frantically on twitter, get out the meditative garden fork which is my blog and ask people what they can tell me about these recordings and who stops them being broadcast and why. And if they are used, who uses them. Comments are open if you can talk openly (you can comment anonymously too).

And tomorrow (assuming it is signed tomorrow)?\nHave you checked whether or not the council considered options other than incineration? What evidence of careful consideration of other options are you relying on? Are you aware that the council has been consistently challenged on this since 2007, (and possibly earlier)?\nAre you aware that the business cases for incineration in general and for this particular incinerator are both now being challenged as unsafe (the economy and the market having changed substantially)? Have you considered the financial impact on council tax payers should these cautions turn out to be well founded? And that if the business performs as badly as expected are you aware of the likely impact on recycling, too?\nHas the contract been set up in such a way that it can attract structural or grant funding? Or has it been set up in such a way that it is ineligible?\nAre you aware of the total cost of this contract? Figures of £76M and £80M have been quoted recently in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph for the capital costs alone. Is that figure current? What are the overall 30 year costs for this project? Is it acceptable that this information is still not in the public domain? Is it acceptable that innocent readers of their local paper might assume that this figure is the total cost of the project?\nAre you aware that the council is deliberately choosing out of date technology and describing it as “tried and tested”? (the information on technology is still not in the public domain).\nAre you aware that the council might be comparing the energy recovery of its own plant with Scandinavian examples? If so are you aware that in Scandinavia (which is used to colder weather and historically much more aware of the importance of insulation and energy security) high performance hot water supply grids are planned in (eg for swimming pools or district heating). Peterborough has not planned a supply grid and has not explained who will buy energy and power generated by this incinerator. Have you seen an example of the output and recovery figures from either Peterborough’s as planned and have you compared that with an operational equivalent in Scandinavia and an operational equivalent in the UK (local campaigners are finding that those in the UK can’t sell their power).\nAre you aware that the UK’s statutory regulatory regime for air pollution (in which the council has placed its trust) is widely regarded as unfit for purpose? The Health Protection Agency is about to undertake research into whether or not it can substantiate the assurances and claims it has been making and upon which the Environment Agency and numerous councils have historically relied. Is the council aware of the potential damage it could do to its own Environment Capital “aspiration” if, as widely expected, it can’t?\nDo you know enough about air pollution and monitoring in the city? Does Peterborough monitor anything other than road traffic? Where are the monitoring stations and are they in the right places? What regime is planned for when the incinerator is operational?\nHave you considered the social, health and cost impacts on the city of a mass burn incinerator in an area with very high (and rising) levels of social deprivation?\nAre you aware that a new incinerator on an industrial site in Fletton is operating and is apparently making people ill, but that the council has not done anything about it, and that not one person amongst the “officers’ panel” and members present at the Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee Call in Meeting on 29th August was equipped to advise the ward councillor who asked about this problem in his ward? I understand that the ward councillor had been told by the Environment Agency that it was a matter for the council. As a member of the public I witnessed that not a single person actually knew how to deal with this relatively small problem – nobody offered to look into it or explain who the ward councillor should talk to, if it wasn’t the Environment Agency. This is despite the presence of senior council officers and (at least) three lawyers.\nAre you satisfied with the monitoring and regulation of pollution in the city?\nPlease can Richard Olive have answers to the questions which Peterborough Friends of the Earth has asked the council on this matter?\nCan you write NONE against – or otherwise provide detail of any personal, family or party interest you have had, have or are likely to have – in any of the following:\n- the council’s Energy Services Company?\n- “Blue Sky”?\n- this sector?\n- this decision?\nI look forward to hearing from you, etc.\nCo-minglers might have to prove quality of result\nA number of local authorities, including Peterborough co-mingle recyclables in a single collection.\nOther authorities collect each recyclable item separately.\nIn 2008 this was demonstrated to be better value, since the end product is more likely to fetch a good price.\nThe Campaign for Real Recycling is challenging the asssumption so far made:\nthat co-mingled collections of paper, metal, plastics and glass produces a quality result.\nhttp://www.realrecycling.org.uk/news/news39.php\nA judicial review hearing will be held in Cardiff, starting on 14th December 2011.\nPeterborough for Responsible Waste Management fights for good quality recycling.",

This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess. It would be ridiculous, if it weren’t also dangerous.\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding non PCC residents from using “our” Household Recycling Facility!\nHave you lobbied your councillors on your preferences? Do you have enough information to have an opinion on where new unitary authority boundaries should lie? Do you know of a Peterborough event where this reorganisation will be considered?\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding Yaxley (Huntingdonshire District Council) and Whittlesey (Fenland District Council) residents from using their nearest (surely?) but “our” Household Recycling Facility!\na good budget requires highly effective team work\nThis meeting was live-streamed here. It began at 6pm.\nThe absence of ten councillors for the budget meeting is concerning. It is a high percentage. My very best wishes to Mayor Marco Cereste who has had a major health shock, and to his family. One councillor was legally prohibited from attending, pending a court appearance, but was able to ask a question from a remote location. I am very happy to live in a country where laws are respected and those who understand how best to implement them are able to do so. Hats off to officers for working to demonstrate a never before observed (by me, at any rate) example of inclusion.\nElected representatives who ABSTAIN on a budget might be expressing frustration or unhappiness, which, however genuinely felt, are emotions of no practical use to the residents they were elected to serve. Where the budget is concerned, it is irresponsible, because a good budget requires effective team work.\nThere is a point in voting AGAINST a budget. But to vote usefully AGAINST a budget, you must have done your homework and have another “alternative” budget up your sleeve. And you must also have the support of other elected representatives, so that you can be confident that it stands a chance of being supported if presented. In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work. You could then vote AGAINST the budget presented by the administration of the government (in this case a council) with a clean conscience, because you have built a better option. When the administration’s proposed budget falls to pass, you can then present your alternative budget. This might be just what the people who elected you need you to do.\nYou can see the breakdown of votes and who said what here.\nPeterborough’s unitary government in recent years has too often featured two sides sneering at each other’s ideas and policies and individuals not listening to good alternative policies simply because they originate from outside their own hard baked ideology (a classic example was the destruction of the local 20’s Plenty campaign, achieved by kicking a worthwhile project into the long grass of a “pilot project” and then those who kicked it never brought the results of that project back to council). Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets. The independent panel seems to have helped sort this out.\nHowever there is still some bad behaviour. During council meetings, councillors are frequently talking to their electorate in the council chamber and putting themselves onto social media. Councillor Nicola Day even took a team selfie during the meeting. Some appear to struggle to put their phone down and are constantly watching their phones while on a livestream. They embarrass Peterborough and its residents. It should be possible for councillors to switch their phones off during a meeting: it is professional to do so and it is simply good manners to give your full attention to the agenda and to your colleagues in a meeting.\nThe passage of the council’s budget on Wednesday was too tight for comfort, but compared with recent years, it was a welcome moment of calm organisation. I congratulate all those who worked constructively with Councillor Mohammed Jamil, Cabinet Member for Finance & Corporate Governance, whose approach has been consultative and consensual, to contribute to it and to vote for it. Hats off especially to Councillor Dennis Jones and to Councillor Wayne Fitzgerald. Without their closing speeches, their clarity and eloquence, this might not have passed and I strongly suspect that there was no superior alternative budget waiting in the wings. Passing any kind of workable budget in this era of badly managed economic decline (Westminster has never ended the “Austerity”) is nothing short of miraculous. I had high hopes for a new Labour government, but so far it has disappointed.\nWe have yet to see what happens as the independent supervisory panel finally walks away.\nThe council had leverage at that point. It needed to act when the residential developer was ready to rent or sell.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nfor me, it was a jaw on floor moment\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\n.. the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too ..\nAt 08:15 (once the programme ends) Just elected Paul Waugh MP (of all people!) describes, (as only a highly articulate, politically savvy and most importantly an experienced journalist could) what was going on there. I recognised his description as applicable to events in Peterborough. If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nSt Johns Church is holding a General Election Hustings\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nIs a bad portrait worse than no portrait at all?\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2022_10_24_bourges-boulevard-floods-again/content_34.html": "It is remarkable that Peterborough City Council and Anglian Water can’t seem to get together to clear and improve drainage on Bourges Boulevard just south of the roundabout at Town Bridge. Flooding at this location often happens in very heavy rain and is reported in the local paper, which used to have its big blue sign on a fancy modern office overlooking the roundabout. (The Peterborough Telegraph has since moved out of the city centre.)\nSo what is going wrong?\nAre Anglian Water and the City Council not talking to one another?\nIt seems maybe not. This is not the only location in the city blighted by what looks like an inter authority communication problem.\nFlooding can follow observations of bad smells. It did this time: a reader notes this in a comment to the article. A smell of sewage is a big signal that drains might be blocked somewhere.\nSo are people not reporting poo pongs to Anglian Water?\nWell, oddly, it isn’t possible to report or describe this particular phenomenon accurately using Anglian Water’s ludicrously coy website. There is no free text field on its reporting forms, and every option avoids any mention of the blocking or the contents of sewers.\nI recently tried to report this problem at a different location and stumbled across this inexplicable reporting obstacle. The closest to a poo-stink-likely-to-be-a-drainage-problem I was able to report referred me to the “local drainage authority” (which in Peterborough is Peterborough City Council). Anglian Water’s reporting system also asks for my water account details, which are as relevant to a drainage problem wherever I happen to find it as my inside leg measurement. So, a bit cross, I rang them up. I know this is inadequate, but it is all I can recommend at the moment. So\nIf you smell poo, do a number one and a number two:\none: telephone Anglian Water on 0345 145 145\nand\ntwo: phone Peterborough City Council on 01733 747474\nIf anyone can identify a not so intrusive email address for Anglian Water, please put it in the comments, below. If you are happy to provide details of your personal water account (if you have one) when reporting an issue in the public realm you can report it using Anglian Water’s online form.\nIs Peterborough City Council a competent drainage authority?\nI’m not sure that the council is aware that when Peterborough Development Corporation handed its brief and assets over to the council, that package included drainage assets and all drainage authority responsibilities. The drainage boards outside the boundary of the council can be found online and there is local democratic involvement in their management: they are active and if there were to be a problem there is a democratic remedy available to local people. Peterborough City Council seems to think that if it ignores them, its drainage assets will look after themselves. This is certainly what happened in Park Ward, when a development on, and its “foundations” in a drain was permitted and the council remarkably failed to assert ownership of the drainage ditch (which it nevertheless clears from time to time). The development made the ditch less manageable and this resulted in a viable long term prospective asset owner walking away. But whatever its position since PDC handed drainage over to it, it has not been able to evade its responsibilities since 2010, when a law was enacted:\n“County and Unitary Authorities have been made Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs) under the Flood & Water Management Act 2010 with responsibilities to prepare and maintain a strategy for local flood risk management in their areas; maintain a register of flood management assets; investigate significant local flooding incidents; issue consents for altering, removing or replacing certain structures or features on ordinary watercourses (outside of Internal Drainage Districts) and play a lead role in emergency planning and recovery after a flood event.” https://www.ada.org.uk/member_type/local-authorities/\nAre Peterborough’s elected members aware of the council’s inherited drainage responsibilities?\nEvidence that they do is welcome.\nIs Peterborough City Council adequately funded to manage its drainage responsibilities?\nLegacy funding was never made available to the council when PDC was abruptly removed from continuing its work to develop and improve Peterborough. This explains the council’s ongoing difficulties funding the maintenance of the landscape the PDC built, including the Green Wheel. Central government has owed the city development infrastructure legacy funding since PDC left. In better economic times, it might have been possible to blur this. But now that the council is up against predictably far heavier rain (due to climate change) and impossible cuts (due to appalling decisions by central government), it makes sense now to claim what’s been due. The city has two MPs. The two of them should be able to do this for the city. They should also know whether other unitary authorities are also owed this funding.\nSo, until I find evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that no, it isn’t.\nIs Peterborough City Council competent to manage drainage and sewer works?\nI welcome evidence that it is. The prevalence of sewage pongs suggests it isn’t. As do the reports listed on the Anglian Water website, which lists long standing sewer repairs still not completed.",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them!

I’d found them on the May Day Bank Holiday when I had described a filthy fire which had rather spoiled the day.\nAt midday that same Wednesday I heard from the Strategic Regulatory Services Manager:\n“I understand from my Colleague XXX that you have enquired as to why no out of hours Pollution Control Service is provided by the Council. The Council though having a duty to provide a Pollution Control Service has no legal responsibility to provide an out of hours service I am afraid, the decision as to the level of resources put into providing the service and the hours it operates is one in law for the Council to decide. The Council to my knowledge has never provided a out of hours service and has certainly not during the last 7 years.\nIn what is an extremely challenging financial climate difficult decisions have to be made with regards to service provision, and that does result in services Pollution Control being no exception having to operate within financial constraints. From both an efficiency perspective, looking at the most effective use of staff time, and a financial one, budgets having already been set for the year, it is not possible to provide an out of hours service in Peterborough this year.\nIt is appreciated that at times having an officer on call may be helpful to a member of public, officers are however still able through planned measures, to operate when necessary at different in order to gain evidence of any offences being committed. In recent times officers have been able to attend a site at a weekend following prior arrangements in order to observe an illegal bonfire which was known to take place regularly, evidence obtained resulted in the case being put before the courts.\nIn your particular case XXX will continue to liaise with you over the problems you are experiencing.”\nThis response confirms the absence of any out of hours toxic fire procedure. It suggests that the council is content with this situation. If, as happened on Monday, the fire service tells the resident that use of their emergency number is not appropriate, the resident has no way to get a toxic fire put out.\nThen on Friday I the Pollution Control Officer said:\n“Following our conversation earlier this week, I can now provide an update on the issue of the bonfire.\nI have spoken to XXX from the Fire Brigade and he is reasonably confident that following the warnings given both by him and his colleagues to the person on site and the Fire Brigade’s action in extinguishing the fire, the problem is unlikely to recur at this particular site.\nGiven this, the council have decided not to take legal action at this time. The reasons for this are as follows:\n- The most useful legislation for dealing with bonfires is the Clean Air Act. However this Act only applies to “trade or industrial premises” or to waste being burned at a site as part of a business’ activities. The premises in question is a domestic property and there is no evidence that the waste was part of the activity of a business – certainly the fire brigade do not believe any of it was brought to the site from elsewhere and the landlord is (at the moment) essentially the occupier of the premises as it is vacant.\n- For domestic properties, the primary legislation is the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), which has two main provisions that apply here: Statutory Nuisance and the requirements in relation to duty of care and proper disposal of waste.\n- Statutory Nuisance law is rarely applied in ‘one-off’ circumstances because it is much easier to prove the existence (or likely occurrence/recurrence) of a nuisance if it has happened more than once.\n- Burning waste such as that which was burned on Monday is against the provisions laid down in the EPA for the proper disposal of waste. However, the burden for the success of legal action on this would fall very much on yourself and the fire officer as given that no officer of the council witnessed the event (for reasons I hope XXX has explained in his email to you) our effectiveness will be limited.\n- Additionally, there are a number of tests that must be applied to any intended legal action in order to ascertain whether it is reasonable and proportionate and in the public interest. The council believe that prosecuting an individual for a first offence of this nature is not reasonable or proportionate and would not be likely to result in a particularly harsh penalty to act as a deterrent.\nFor these reasons, it is not felt that the time, effort and cost required in taking a case to court are justifiable. Yesterday a hand-delivered letter was issued warning of the potential consequences of any further occurrence. Please can you continue to monitor the situation, and should there be a recurrence of the problem we will investigate the likely occurrence of a nuisance.\nShould you have any further questions please do not hesitate to get in touch. …”\nI am suggesting that we need a working procedure open and available to anybody who wants to get a toxic fire put out and investigated outside the council’s working hours.\nAs things stand I must dial 999 even though the fire service doesn’t consider these events merit an emergency call.\nMy bank holiday and a filthy fire – two days later\nOn Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf\nMy bank holiday & a filthy fire\nMy intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough. What do you think?\nMeanwhile thank you to Blue Watch at Dogsthorpe Fire Station for helping today!\nParty Election Broadcast from Green Party\nlittle green calendar\nlittle green calendar aims to list events in Peterborough, green and not so green\nPeterborough to host Environment Capital Conference with Professor Hugh Montgomery on 27th February\n27th February 9am – 1pm\nAt this event to be hosted by Peterborough City Council at Kingsgate Community Church in Parnwell, Professor Hugh Montgomery will present a keynote speech on climate change.

This is not the same as having one qualified person on one’s own team and begs the question who the possibly qualified person was. Happy as always to be corrected.\nIf Clerk of Works is the role which secures budgetary control (see above video), why isn’t Morson (the contractor apparently covering the role) picking up 100% of the £4.5M cost overrun? One way to establish the reason for this would be to subject the relevant contracts and subcontracts to scrutiny by a person competent in law of contract.\nPersonally, if I were the council I’d bring the role of Clerk of Works straight back in-house to establish and secure a clear line of responsibility and management. A good properly qualified person in this role could save the city a fortune over time.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2015_04_18_twinkle-twinkle-polished-car/content_517.html": "You see, our Park Ward councillor team (two Labour, one Conservative) went for what they describe as “aggressive pavement cyclists” recently and tasked the police with talking to shocked children and middle aged women cycling along gently as well as people who couldn’t speak English. (My sample was tiny: but I did one.) They fined about a third of the people they stopped: most of them probably incapable of being polite and apologising nicely to a policeman. (Some offenders just got warned, although whether or not cycling on a pavement is an offence in all circumstances is a moot point.) So I think it only fair to point out that cycling on the pavement can be a perfectly logical and reasonable response to dangerous junctions, roads and cycle lanes and is a better place to cycle if your lights have just packed up.\nCars which park in the Park Road cycle lane, or across it or on the pavement are a regular feature of life at this end of Park Road and I for one don’t think it is safe. I think badly behaved drivers are one of a number of contributory factors encouraging “pavement cycling”.\nI didn’t paint in the double yellow lines (which most people don’t even believe are there any more: they are virtually worn out). The Conservative council did. So I think elected Conservative members of all people should be able to show us how we can all live happily with their decisions.\nA third was the proportion fined according to the police at a police panel I attended, if memory serves. If there are people who are being injured by hit and run cyclists, then there needs to be an education campaign. This is not a problem limited to cyclists. It would also be good to see offenders taken to court through a legitimate and fair process. If the council really wants to get cyclists onto the road, the safety and condition of cycle lanes should be a top priority.\nLikeLike\nAnd, as I have pointed out before, the action on pavement cyclists was called for by concerned pedestrians, some of them having been victims (several needing hospital treatment). One third were fined? Have you obtained information from the Police? Pavement cyclists wre spoken to by the Police and Council Road Safety officers which, I wluld suggest, was not unreasonable. Meanwhile, I have also pressed for action on speeding traffic, attending sppedwatch sessions; and have held a number of meetings with Road Safety Team officers to discuss the need for better, more joined-up cycle lanes, as well as the introduction of 20mph speed limits in residential areas across the city. In fact, I attended this year’s annual 20s Plenty conference in Cambridge, along with the Principal Road Safety officer. I think my record stands up!

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_waste-management/content_94.html": "Waste activism in Peterborough has a long and distinguished history and a great many people and many organised groups have got stuck in, many of them heroically and steadily cleaning up things which simply shouldn’t be where they are.\nThis blog years ago as a lament that I had not been able to achieve something I’d dedicated a great deal of time and energy to: stopping the construction of a plant to incinerate domestic waste. And in this blog I began to look at and discuss the politics of Peterborough generally, partly in order to understand and explain the weaknesses of campaigning organisations in the city (who I then felt could all have done better) against a political decision to incinerate, based on levels of (elected councillor) ignorance which I’d never encountered before in any organisation. I needed to understand how that had happened too, and who benefits from a toxic waste disposal policy. Who benefits from a waste policy which isn’t working.\nMeanwhile it seems that the attitudes I encountered: literally: “if you can’t see it, there is nothing there” approach to stack emissions has created a national problem, especially in England, which now does things worse and to lower standards than Scotland, Wales, the USA and Europe. Brexit might offer hope to those that are keen to practice toxic politics, but the toxins left in our environment aren’t going anywhere.\nBut about three years ago the Green Party began a Flash Mob Litter Pick, which roved around in response to resident callouts to deal with litter hotspots. Here’s a Flash Mob after a session litter picking in 2016, taken in a New England cul de sac: Like any litter picker, we were dealing with the council and its ways of doing things, with the odd hazardous item (discarded hypodermic needles are one of the worst at the moment) and we were also thinking about things like the bags the council uses, why people do what they do, where it comes from and how it travelled to where it is. We had hundreds of conversations, with each other, with passers by, with the council and with the people who deal with fly tipped toxic wastes (such as paints, oils, chemicals). It didn’t take us long to appreciate that people were sometimes being turned away by the legal disposal routes because of the way they had been implemented by the council or because of the conversations they had had with council operatives. We encountered a number of people who had been turned away from the Household Waste centre at Dogsthorpe. We realised that if you make people feel they are doing something wrong when they thought they were doing something right (they just didn’t know about the law or the procedure for doing what the council requires them to do) you are probably just building anti-council feelings and even another fly tip. The council operative is probably doing the right thing: saying all the right things, but the person to whom they are talking is struggling to cope with the situation. Some people get angry. Some people are shocked. In this situation, people may hear what is said to them, but they won’t be able to listen. So as we picked, we worked out that if one cul de sac could produce two car boot fulls of waste and a pile of fly tip, then there would be several skips full in each ward in the city. The volume of discarded waste lying around in our environment, defining our environment for everyone living or growing up in it – are unbelievable.\nWith fly tip, we looked at it and we began to understand the impact of the nice man at the front door who offers to take away your rubbish despite not having obtained the all important waste carrier’s licence. The role of this character is key: he (we think it is usually a he!) has perfectly understood the business opportunity provided to him by this corporate communications disaster.\nSometimes it is a whole house contents which is tipped out onto the highway, or someone else’s private property. Anybody in Peterborough can see that there is a big problem with landlords, or with people providing services to landlords and tenants. People living in or running the rental sector grab the cheapest furniture, because tenures are short and incomes are tight and what could be a re-use opportunity is instead a dumped problem. Legitimate house clearance businesses: where are they?\nJulie Howell (pictured here in New England) took the conclusions to Orton Waterville where she was a parish councillor and she applied herself to communicating directly with every resident. Waste management was just one of the things she tackled in her communications. Here she discusses fly tipping on her blog:\nhttp://howell4ortonwaterville.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/getting-grip-on-fly-tipping.html\nAnd here she is discussing fly tip on Radio Cambridgeshire yesterday morning:\nYesterday she was responding to the council leader who made some interesting comments in an article published in the Peterborough Telegraph soon after Julie was elected to the city councillor and thereby displaced the cabinet member responsible for waste management. The paper’s headline and the photograph put fly tipping into the spotlight.\nhttps://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/council-leader-pledges-new-efforts-to-tackle-fly-tipping-in-peterborough-1-8491096\nFirst he announces that fly-tipping will be “a focus” for the council this coming year. And admits that the issue was “repeatedly raised on the doorsteps in the run-up to the elections.” This might suggest that there is hope.\nBut then he says something really interesting. What he appears to do in a scant four lines of text, is give a summary of the results of the Free Bulky Waste Trial. I don’t know if a detailed analysis of the results of the trial has been made available to elected councillors or whether or not that analysis breaks down at ward level. But if not that is what I’d be asking for if I was a councillor.\nHoldich claims that the trial “made no difference to the amount of fly-tipping,” This suggests that the council has a way of very accurately measuring fly tipping activity over a period of time. That would be very interesting, if it were true. I think the police might be interested in how the council knows this too, since not being able to catch fly tippers is one of its defining and most annoying characteristics.\nThen he asserts that “the council missed out on £40,000 from fewer paid collections.” Now, assuming he’s right about that, it suggests to me that the people making use of the free trial were people who would otherwise have called the council to arrange a paid for collection. This group of people, complying with existing procedures and forking out for the collections they organise does not strike me as an appropriate target group if you wanted to attract the waste which is being fly tipped and the people doing the fly tipping, because this group is by Holdich’s definition not fly-tipping their waste anyway. They are doing it correctly and dutifully providing the council with additional revenue.\nThen Holdich claims that “It’s a national problem and nobody has come up with a panacea.” I think by calling on a Greek goddess, he is both looking for and deriding a universal fix. He might do better if he looked systematically at another goddess: Hygeia is the Greek goddess of cleanliness and hygiene, a goddess understood by the Greeks to be part of Aesclepius’ family of medicine, health and feeling good generally.\nBut let’s have a closer look at the council’s “Free Bulky Waste Trial”. It was designed to run for thirteen weeks: from 11th December to 9th March. A bulky waste collection normally costs £23.50. So adding up the available collections during the free trial, we have a cap of 52 collections per day, and an estimated “more than 1,000 free collections” during month one. Then a maximum of 26 per day for the remainder of the trial. Residents would be free to book a collection between 4th December to 5th March. So what actually happened?\nWe don’t know, except that the available slots were taken up enthusiastically to the extent that no more bookings for free collections were taken from 25th January, six weeks before the trial was supposed to end. Taking Christmas into account, the Trial stopped half way through. In fact it didn’t survive the Spring Clean Season. When the council closed new advance bookings, it was clear already that it was well organised people who were using the trial.\nWhat we do know is that if £40,000 revenue was lost to the council because people using the trial would otherwise have booked a chargeable collection, then 1702 free collections were made who’d otherwise pay for those collections. These will have been well organised people complying with procedures, who probably were unlikely to be fly tipping waste or giving it to to a fly tipper masquerading as a legitimate waste handler before the trial began.\nThe big question, then, is how many collections were made above 1702.\n52 per day for the first month would give us four weeks one of which includes the Christmas break. So let’s say 52 x 4 x 3 = 624\nThen we have 26 per day for the other nine weeks, so x 4 x 9 = 936\nIf we add these figures together and take them away from 1702, we get 142.\nRoughly one hundred and forty two collections were available to people who maybe would NOT normally have called the council. And that figure can only be true if the council and those people were able to use every single slot it had available. Given that this target group is likely to be less well organised, less well resourced and generally less compliant with how the council runs things, I find this highly unlikely.\nWe don’t know if the council added capacity, as it promised it would at the outset of the trial if demand was high. And if it didn’t, we don’t know why it didn’t. It may have realised that the non fly tipping community was not engaging very much with its trial, and if so, that would not surprise me.\nI am sure that Holdich feels that the trial proves his point. I dare say it proves mine too: that the systems in place are unfit for purpose for many sections of our community and it is also clear that the ruling Conservatives still have no sensible plan in place to change that.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_scrutiny/content_42.html": "I don’t remember dreaming last night. I often dream. But last night I slept that dark recovery sleep which comes night after night when you have been sleep deprived for a long time. Like Guinness. Dark and deep. No images. But something important got stitched together in the night. As I swung out of bed I knew exactly why I had got so cross yesterday about the livestream being cancelled during the hustings at the St Johns Hustings on Tuesday. Anger is never a good thing, but it is the most important directional kick and motivator available. Incredibly powerful. Understanding it and reflecting on it matters: I always try to do that. I was puzzling about my feelings when I went to bed. But it took a whole night’s sleep to alert me to what had made me incandescent with fury yesterday.\nI’d been looking in the wrong place for the answer.\nLast night’s sleep brought me back to another painful memory. I am very aware of other candidates’ emotions: I’ve been upset several times. The way candidates are treated is very important. One party leader at the Tuesday railed against his candidate’s exclusion from the platform. I couldn’t help but sympathise. Candidates need so much support and help in doing what they try to do. It is impossible not to see the hurt and pain which they encounter on the way. During the night two memories of anger and a feeling of me personally being badly let down connected themselves together. I’d been reflecting on yet another occasion (yes standing for election is full of drama and high emotion!), but of course: it wasn’t that occasion which mattered.\nNearly the same thing happened before. Of course it did. I was told years ago at another hustings that a professional recording would be made and that it would be broadcast but it never was. My performance on the platform was pretty awful. But the broken promise was what mattered to and hurt me.\nThat’s why I was nearly incoherent yesterday on Twitter. Do go and have a look. https://twitter.com/FionaRadic\nThis morning I am calm. I realise this is a rerun of what has happened before. There is a pattern. The murderer of tracks may have struck before.\nThe trouble with getting upset about things is that you can’t always confront the actual problem so you embalm it in a better buried place in your consciousness in order to “move on”. This is especially true if you are a directly affected and traumatised candidate. But as it happens, this week I have a huge advantage. I am not the candidate. True I am in recovery from having been the candidate in two very exciting and over close together elections. But I am deliciously and delightfully free of the specific challenges which every candidates faces: including having to put a lot of very important things on one side in order to deal with the urgent things. And I can sleep. I am looking after another candidate. But I am not him. I can reflect. I can think. Bliss.\nA high level of disappointment between what was promised at an event and what is delivered is why I now go equipped with a camera and even a crew if I can assemble one and try to report on the event as well as perform (when I am a candidate) at a hustings. Of course this is entirely because it has happened before. My behaviour is totally conditioned by the occasion which sleep brought back to me. I’d somehow excluded it from my thoughts yesterday even though it was the causative event of my current behaviour. You can only know what it is like to do both jobs if you’ve done it. Candidates shouldn’t need to perform as candidates and as reporter. Multiple reasons why not, including obvious bias.\nIt isn’t an accident that I’ve never been elected. For me that is never, has never been the most important thing. A functioning democracy is far more important to me. I was aware when I started my blog things didn’t work properly in Peterborough.\nWell here’s a very important example of things going utterly wrong. If you have an election, voters need to see the candidates as soon as possible so that they can make as good a decision as they possibly can.\nAnything which supports that process is contributing to the workings of democracy. Huge numbers of people not directly involved in the party political processes help the democratic process to work as well as it can. They often don’t get a thank you. The vast majority get absolutely nothing in return. We need more of them and they need to be supported and feel far more empowered.\nAnything or anyone which obstructs that needs to be identified and exposed.\nNobody and nothing should have had the power to murder the livestream on Tuesday. The host of an event is in charge and a candidate at a public event is in a public place. So how was that even possible?\nSo today I’ve decided to stop yelling frantically on twitter, get out the meditative garden fork which is my blog and ask people what they can tell me about these recordings and who stops them being broadcast and why. And if they are used, who uses them. Comments are open if you can talk openly (you can comment anonymously too). But you are very welcome to use my contact form (see top right) if you can’t talk openly.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2024_04_18_bye-bye-box/content_472.html": "I walked through Central Park recently and realised that nearly every single box had died. I took a couple of photos intending to write to the council and promptly forgot.\nThen, thanks to Angus Ellis I received a useful reminder. Thank you, Angus.\nThe reminder arrived in the form of a Labour and Co-operative Party leaflet suggesting I vote for Angus who is this party’s candidate in Park Ward. It dropped on my doormat and I eventually got round to reading it. I discovered a very rare picture of Park Ward Councillor Mohammed Samir (who, along with another Ravensthorpe councillor is not profligate with his words or his image) at the bottom right of page three. And even more surprising, there, in front of his frown and rising up the bank behind him is scorched, brown and dead or dying box hedging, telling every sharp eyed reader in Park Ward the very sad story about its own highly likely extinction.\nWeather conditions are increasingly brutal and this pattern of intemperate weather (part of our new, not so temperate climate) is particularly cruel to box, a key evergreen parks and gardens hedging plant. Long periods of extreme drought alternating with non stop record rainfall will have stressed this along with many other plants, including many of Central Park’s trees.\nSlowly, since 2007 when it was first recorded in the UK, the box moth has been travelling north (it began its very long journey somewhere in South East Asia!) and here it is: rampaging across Peterborough. It noticed it in my garden only last summer. It probably reached the park before that.\nI wrote to the council this morning to ask that the dead box bushes are dug out. A very sad job for those who tended them. It used to be good gardening practice to burn diseased and infested plants. These days, hot composting (we have brown garden bins for that in Peterborough) will probably do the job of disinfection.\nI have also been thinking about what needs doing in Central Park to deal with the loss of the lovely robust evergreen structure which the box has provided for many years around Central Park’s beds and along paths. Evergreens are particularly important in winter, when so many plants are bare.\nReplacement structural evergreen hedging can’t be planted safely in Spring or Summer (October is the very earliest sensible time) and until then at the earliest, removing dead plants will open the beds up to unwanted foot traffic: both pet and human.\nFast growing decorative annual flowers might have time to provide protective ground cover until a decision is made on whether and how to replace.\nI would be very surprised if there is one plant which could do what the extraordinary and now at risk box did for all the park’s flower beds, since the conditions in each bed are increasingly varied: some are very very dry (memorial gardens) and others around the outer path are shady and one or two occasionally waterlogged. Decisions could be complicated.\nSeeding with forget-me-not (on damper beds) and/or nasturtium (round the top of the dry memorial garden).\nAnd if a decision is made to retain hedge type edging, which plants might work well in the various conditions to be found in different beds around the park?\nI think that rosemary might work around the memorial garden. It doesn’t mind neglect and drought and responds to drought by flowering (all year round!!) if dry. It doesn’t mind being on a bank which will lose rainwater. It can be clipped (min twice a year) into a very beautiful and sturdy box type hedge. But it probably shouldn’t go in straight away: there will be too much box moth around and it’s definitely a second choice target!",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough_page_14/content_671.html": "This evening Cllr Darren Fower proposed a motion at Full Council. The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_02_10_save-rhubarb-bridge/content_527.html": "@SustransPBoro and Peterborough Cycling Forum members gathered this week to protest against the proposal (announced in the council’s budget) to demolish Rhubarb Bridge. Follow Sustrans Peterborough on facebook. A member of the Werrington Running Club explained that the running club members use the bridge. While we were there the bridge was never empty: children were making their way to school: many pupils at Voyager school will get to school via this bridge and commuters were cycling and walking over it.\nOn top of the bridge, it ducks under the A47: the path descends a bit, making it an up and under bridge. It is an extraordinary design and in its day was very innovative. It is difficult to envisage a better design, given the continuous roar of traffic along the A47 crosses the Lincoln Road here: the main trunk route north out of Peterborough. Rhubarb Bridge (apparently so called because rhubarb kept coming up on its embankments when it was newly built) allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross two major roads on a set of off road, fully segregated paths, ramps and steps. There is absolutely no conflict with road traffic, which as things are, only stops for more road traffic.\nThe only road user who is not catered for, is (possibly) someone using a wheelchair or mobility scooter. There are ramps and they are certainly no steeper than many hills, but on the morning of our photoshoot, I did not see anyone attempt them in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter (which are very popular in Peterborough).",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2015_01_01_wind-power-in-peterborough/content_43.html": "I am convinced that the design of wind turbines is still in its infancy. Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:",

That is why I wrote about the sensation of falling which is how the shock of the allegations first affected me.\nI have been too busy out and about campaigning to write much about this story but while I’ve been busy a great deal has happened. This post is an update and a pulling together of threads.\nThe council can’t do anything\nFirstly in response to a number of points and questions I communicated to the council’s leader and chief executive officer, the council has explained its position with respect to removing an elected representative:\n“The legal position is that all democratically elected councillors, are entitled as of right to attend all meetings of full council. There is no power for officers or members to remove that right.”\nSo while “Jessica” believes that Coles should resign as a city councillor (and I wholeheartedly support her call) I don’t think that anybody can force that to happen. If Coles continues not to resign, it seems that he can’t be pushed.\nHis party won’t do anything\nI believe that a decent political party would have suspended Coles already, pending clarification of his situation. However his party is the Conservative Party which is in power and which has been close to being in power for a century. It is an integral part of the establishment which has used the police to target over 1,000 organisations, including my own political party, my party’s only MP and my party’s only member of the House of Lords. This is why I personally have no expectations that the Conservative Party will even worry about behaving decently: that simply isn’t what the party or the British establishment is about. They are about power full stop. If they did suspend or expel him I would expect him to opt to remain in post as an independent councillor. This may be more of a worry to them than his remaining in post. The horrible question which then arises is where are the other 120 ex spy cops and how do their current networks, contacts, employments or appointments help to protect their secrets and abuses or those of others and to what extent and how might such arrangements be tolerated or even organised? Let’s not underestimate the usefulness of professional, political and cultural networks. Cllr Coles is one of the best connected people in Peterborough.\nThree investigations are underway: none of which stop him talking\nBack to fast moving present reality. There are now three investigations or cases ongoing. As far as I am aware none of these require Coles to maintain silence on the allegations: his silence is entirely a matter of personal choice, not of contractual or legal obligation. I am as ever happy to be corrected.\n1 A civil case is now underway at the Metropolitan Police Service’s Legal Directorate.\nThere have been rumours on social media of an out of court settlement. This gossip is not true.\n2 “Jessica” has been admitted as a core participant into the Undercover Policing Inquiry (UCPI)\n3 The Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel will consider the referral back from the IPCC\nThe Independent Police and Complaints Commission (IPCC soon to be IOPC) responded to a FOI request in the following terms:\nwhich at first glance looks as if the IPCC is not investigating and did not investigate. But if you check what the IPCC does and how it does it, it is perfectly possible that this interpretation is not quite correct. IPCC can supervise local investigations without actually doing them. This statement does not eliminate the possibility that it could be involved in supervising a Cambridgeshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (Cambridgeshire OPCC or here just OPCC) investigation which hasn’t started yet. As for regulations, here is something which may or may not help in understanding what they are and what will or won’t happen next.\nIn order to understand what has or hasn’t happened here, it would be necessary to see both referrals and to form a judgement about their sufficiency or otherwise. It would also be necessary to understand whether these referrals relate only to Coles’ behaviour while he was applying for or occupying the post of Cambridgeshire Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner (as I strongly suspect is the case).\nMeanwhile the local paper indicates that the Cambridgeshire OPCC has delegated the investigation to the Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel. This body meets next on 6th September. The agenda for that meeting is not yet online, but it should be available on the 1st at the latest.\nWe really do need to know what Coles’ motives were in going for the role of Deputy PCC and we need to know everything about who knew the whats and the whys about that appointment.",

This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough. What do you think?\nMeanwhile thank you to Blue Watch at Dogsthorpe Fire Station for helping today!",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2015_02_19_frack-2/content_391.html": "Thank you for contacting me about fracking, I understand your concerns with this matter and appreciate your correspondence.\nShale gas is a promising new potential energy resource which could reduce our reliance on imported gas and help with keeping energy costs low. It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_08_30_mini-sit-in-at-call-in/content_599.html": "Last night the committee with a very long name about which I have blogged previously met again, this time to consider a Call-In Request. It met to decide whether or not to call-in the decision made by Deputy Leader Councillor Matthew Lee (CONSERVATIVE) to make Viridor the preferred bidder to run the council’s planned incinerator (Lot 1).\nThe members of this committee are:\n- Councillor Marion Todd (Chairman)\n- Councillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman)\n- Councillor Mohammed Nadeem\n- Councillor Yasmeen Maqbool\n- Councillor Stuart Martin\n- Councillor Nick Thulbourn\n- Councillor Judy Fox\n- Councillor Dale McKean (Reserve)\n- Councillor Lisa Forbes (Reserve)\n- Councillor Chris Ash (Reserve) (source: Peterborough City Council)\nCllr Maqbool had given advance notice of her absence and Cllr Dale McKean attended in her place.\nAt the end of about four hours of lengthy, soporific, off topic but occasionally revelatory proceedings the committee decided 4 to 3 to reject the request for a call-in.\nVoted AGAINST calling in the decision (and therefore supporting Cllr Lee’s decision)\nCouncillor Marion Todd (Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Mohammed Nadeem CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Dale McKean (Reserve) CONSERVATIVE\nVoted FOR calling in the decision (and supporting reference back to Full Council or decision maker, but unable to vote for either option since the other vote took place first)\nCouncillor Stuart Martin LABOUR\nCouncillor Nick Thulbourn LABOUR\nCouncillor Judy Fox INDEPENDENT\nThe meeting began at 6pm with Apologies and Declaration of Interests. No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.",

Smoke and smog affect visitors’ perceptions of the city as they step onto the platform and air quality has a serious and ongoing impact on residents’ health and wellbeing. Many people living in the city have actually forgotten what fresh air smells like: they are no longer aware they are living in smoggy conditions: they simply don’t smell the smoke any more. These fires (many of them illegal) are set in the evening, just as council officers go home and since they are usually “safe” (i.e. someone is supervising the fire and it isn’t getting out of control) the fire brigade is not required to take action.\nCouncil decided to approve, construct and launch (2016) its very own landfill waste incinerator with Cllr Kreling (on the planning committee at the time of approval) observing that if she couldn’t see anything coming out of the stack (the planning committee was taken on a tour of a similar monster), nothing was coming out. The council has never agreed to and is not live streaming data about its emissions from the stack.\nPeterborough Renewable Energy Limited who were the first to propose an incinerator for the city did agree to live stream their emissions data on their website. But this is not the incinerator which has gone live.\nThe Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor for East Ward, the ward with both planned incinerators sitting in it, offered to throw Richard Olive and me out of the council chamber She couldn’t throw us out because she couldn’t find a bailiff. But she was perfectly able to make a lousy decision without listening to evidence. For me, this was my introduction to the realities of politics in Peterborough. Most people have a vague sense of trust in their elected representatives. I lost whatever tiny bit I had left that day.\nBetween then and now council decided to knock down and pulverise numbers of large buildings made of brick, cement and plaster (Thomas Deacon School and several other predecessor-to-PFI schools, Bridge House, Peterborough District Hospital & assorted buildings on site). No dust suppression in place during the works and no coverage of the remaining mountains of dust (I observed the 20 ft high mountain of grey dust next to Aldermans Drive yesterday: 14th March 2016).\nThe Junction of Taverners Road with Bourges Boulevard is close to and downwind of the pile of pulverised sky scraper hospital and is also in a high density residential area. This junction is now close to breaching traffic pollution limits and that is according to official monitors. Are we surprised? Hardly. Cough Cough.\nIn London it has been shown that official monitoring is significantly understating the true state of affairs: http://cleanair.london/?s=monitorin…\nPeople feel there is nothing they can do. But there are a few things.\nMore people need to observe democracy in action, even if it does mean risking getting thrown out of meetings. The dishonour of getting thrown out is not yours.\nWe could choose not to reelect councillors who fail to help improve air quality and who drive themselves around in heavy overpowered diesel vehicles.\nWe could vote in councillors who don’t drive. Or who drive electric, hybrid and low emissions vehicles. The importance of leadership cannot be overstated.\nWe could vote in councillors who understand that a 20mph speed limit in Peterborough’s residential streets would make cycling and walking pleasanter and would reduce the number of journeys taken by car.\nWe could find a real time air pollution app which relies on independent air monitoring and which works in Peterborough, so that we are not obliged to rely solely on council owned data.\nThe council could live stream its incinerator emissions and on street air pollution monitoring data on its website.

This is a rare thing in Peterborough: a ward hustings. As far as I am aware Park Ward is the only ward in the unitary authority of Peterborough which holds a regular hustings events. Here, voters are invited, either by the residents’ associations or by whoever leaflets the ward. Park Ward has begun to view them as an important part of the run up to election day. I am a big fan of hustings, as a glimpse at my blog will confirm. I’d like to see several in every ward, since they give people chances to thrash out where candidates stand on different issues, and how they perform, and what they are like.\nAnyway every candidate appearing on the ballot paper in May had been invited to the Church Hall by a local residents’ association and the turnout was small, but respectable and well informed. John Peach, CON, was the last candidate to arrive. I would probably have been taking my seat and organising bits of paper when there was the very slightest flutter of excitement in the audience. The hustings proceeded without incident.\nOne of the most true and telling observations of the 2015 election campaign was made by a man at the back of the audience. He pointed out that climate change had disappeared from all the parties’ election campaigns.\nAfter the event someone else came up to me and asked me to accompany him into the car park to see how John Peach had parked his car. He claimed to have felt an impact, but I am pretty sure his tongue was in his cheek and I have to say the wall did not move for me. But naturally I had a look. And of course I took a photo.\nI couldn’t see the wall behind the rear bumper at all. Can you?\nI realised that had there been the sort of penetrative event you see in a crazy American road movie, instead of talking to a man in a car park, I might have seen a man flying across my field of vision and just for a second I imagined him fly, hanging on to his church hall chair as a massive black car skidded across the parquet floor in a hail of bricks and plaster dust. But that was just me imagining something which certainly did not happen that evening. Thank goodness.\nWhat I did observe is that Cllr John Peach, (who was reelected and has since been crowned Mayor of our fair city) had proved himself capable of parking his car next to a wall in such a way that there is not a single millimetre between the car and the bricks. Not a single one.\nI blog this now only because the antique Jaguar, the mayoral vehicle EG1 is reportedly:\nand I for one would like to know how #PossibleRightOff happened.\nAnd what it costs to keep this particular mayor in maintenance and insurance.\nPerhaps Conservative councillors could tell the voters exactly what they each spend on driving around the city in very fancy cars, and how much of that expense is funded by residents?\nSaturday 16th January 2016 11am – 3pm at Riverside Pavilion, Candy Street, Peterborough, PE2 9RE\nAn Open Space discussion on how to create a green and sustainable Peterborough is being hosted by Peterborough Green Party. Tickets are free, but places are limited!\nThe event offers attendees a chance to share their views openly on a number of topics, which will be chosen by participants at the event. We hope to pursue the theme of a sustainable and green city and our objective is to facilitate and engage in ongoing dialogue with the City Council.\nI attended a workshop hosted by Civic Voice and as a result have joined a Peterborough “Asset of Community Value” group founded at the workshop. The workshop explained how an “asset of community value” can be registered with the local council and what that means should it be or become threatened. The rules were explained and what and what was not eligible.\nThe new group is not a “political” group in that peoples’ views on the legislation may be strong, but those views are not the point. I would describe this as a “technical” alliance between people prepared to share knowledge and help people in Peterborough who want to do this. I was quite shocked to learn that Peterborough has only registered two Assets of Community Value (the Green Backyard and the Football Ground) whereas Chelmsford identified seventy which needed to be registered.\nWhat about the Lido? We need a little list.\nCllr Andy Coles acted as spokesperson for the Peterborough group at the workshop and he was an obvious elected councillor lead. For those who don’t know him he is a keen supporter of The Green Backyard and used to be its beekeeper. He has also supported the parishing of Westwood (a project currently in abeyance, but which I strongly support) and he currently holds the council’s “community” brief.\nAlun Williams volunteered to look after the membership.\nAs part of my fundraising for Going to Mongolia I am hosting two events. The first is on the 4th of July at 19:30 and is a Piano Recital with Irena Radić who is currently studying at the Royal College of Music. Irena has won several awards: Peterborough Young Musician of the Year 2013; the Jaques Samuel Competition; Oundle young musician of the Year 2013; and the Teresa Carreno award.

This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess.

In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work.

Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets.

If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nIs a bad portrait worse than no portrait at all?\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nI wrote to my MP in April about pensions restitution for women born in the 1950s.

It’s not just local councillors who are in thrall to their phones. MPs are also at fault (remember tractor man?).\nTwo. Anyone who was around in the days of Peterborough’s development corporation will know how they set out to do much more than build houses, roads, factory units and so on. They aimed to build a city where families would want to bring up their children, and the result was high quality modern libraries, top sports facilities and much more.\nSince those days Peterborough has got much bigger but the facilities that make life enjoyable have been pared back. Of course the country’s financial woes and government economic policy have an impact on what happens locally, but PCC decision-makers do seem to suffer from a sorry lack of ambition.\nNb.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_04_13_address-to-voters/content_430.html": "I am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again. Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.\nOne thought on “ADDRESS TO VOTERS”",

And since I wrote about a jargon-prone subject which most people would find technical, difficult and tedious an over speedy response really wouldn’t impress me.\nBut offering an apology for responding within a week achieves so much.

The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.\nGreat post, Fiona. The importance of counting agents cannot be over-stated.\nAs for parish councils, are there any residents’ associations, formal or informal, that might some day become a parish council? I wonder if any blocks of flats in the ward have residents’ committees that might also be interested in being part of something bigger, something that is the lowest tier of government with a budget and decision-making powers.\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2015_07_01_what-about-the-lido/content_557.html": "I attended a workshop hosted by Civic Voice and as a result have joined a Peterborough “Asset of Community Value” group founded at the workshop. The workshop explained how an “asset of community value” can be registered with the local council and what that means should it be or become threatened. The rules were explained and what and what was not eligible.\nThe new group is not a “political” group in that peoples’ views on the legislation may be strong, but those views are not the point. I would describe this as a “technical” alliance between people prepared to share knowledge and help people in Peterborough who want to do this. I was quite shocked to learn that Peterborough has only registered two Assets of Community Value (the Green Backyard and the Football Ground) whereas Chelmsford identified seventy which needed to be registered.\nWhat about the Lido? We need a little list.\nCllr Andy Coles acted as spokesperson for the Peterborough group at the workshop and he was an obvious elected councillor lead. For those who don’t know him he is a keen supporter of The Green Backyard and used to be its beekeeper. He has also supported the parishing of Westwood (a project currently in abeyance, but which I strongly support) and he currently holds the council’s “community” brief.\nAlun Williams volunteered to look after the membership.\nYou can join the new group on face book. You will then be added to a google group.\nHi Fiona,\nActually, joining the facebook group won’t get you added to the mailing list, as this doesn’t give me access to people’s email addresses. If the mailing list gets used I’ll try to share content with the group and encourage people to sign up.\nLikeLike",

After the Conservatives insisted on two recounts and then insisted on yet another check, the Park Ward result was finally agreed some time after three o’clock this morning. I got to bed at 4am. The full results for the Peterborough City Council elections are here. Votes for the first First Past The Post Police and Crime Commissioner election are still being counted.\nI am extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me and who supported me in this election. Everything you did means a lot. Thank you so very much.\nFor me, the campaign I was most concerned about was the one run by Kirsty Knight to retain her seat and I congratulate her very very warmly on achieving this despite having made a tough and gutsy decision to leave the Green Party just a few weeks prior to the election. Kirsty has almost certainly broken another election campaign record and she has certainly set an excellent precedent for Peterborough. Thank you everyone who has supported Kirsty.\nIt was noticeable to me that a couple of newbie Liberal Democrat candidates also won with remarkably short campaigns. Hats off to both of them too.\nI feel for Nick Sandford who has to continue to perform his duties as Mayor (until the Mayor making ceremony) despite losing his seat last night. I know he’ll see the funny side, but still. While Peterborough elects in thirds, surely, most years, the Mayor doesn’t have to be someone facing election in the same year? It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_09_13_incineration-decision-letter-to-ward-councillors/content_30.html": "Today I wrote in the following terms to my ward councillors, copying in my MP.\nmass burn incinerator for household waste\nI invite your comments on how you have protected the interests of the residents of my ward and of the city in the years since 2007 in this matter.\nShould the council reconsider what it is doing: What would the costs of pulling out of this contract be today? And tomorrow (assuming it is signed tomorrow)?\nHave you checked whether or not the council considered options other than incineration? What evidence of careful consideration of other options are you relying on? Are you aware that the council has been consistently challenged on this since 2007, (and possibly earlier)?\nAre you aware that the business cases for incineration in general and for this particular incinerator are both now being challenged as unsafe (the economy and the market having changed substantially)? Have you considered the financial impact on council tax payers should these cautions turn out to be well founded? And that if the business performs as badly as expected are you aware of the likely impact on recycling, too?\nHas the contract been set up in such a way that it can attract structural or grant funding? Or has it been set up in such a way that it is ineligible?\nAre you aware of the total cost of this contract? Figures of £76M and £80M have been quoted recently in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph for the capital costs alone. Is that figure current? What are the overall 30 year costs for this project? Is it acceptable that this information is still not in the public domain? Is it acceptable that innocent readers of their local paper might assume that this figure is the total cost of the project?\nAre you aware that the council is deliberately choosing out of date technology and describing it as “tried and tested”? (the information on technology is still not in the public domain).\nAre you aware that the council might be comparing the energy recovery of its own plant with Scandinavian examples? If so are you aware that in Scandinavia (which is used to colder weather and historically much more aware of the importance of insulation and energy security) high performance hot water supply grids are planned in (eg for swimming pools or district heating). Peterborough has not planned a supply grid and has not explained who will buy energy and power generated by this incinerator. Have you seen an example of the output and recovery figures from either Peterborough’s as planned and have you compared that with an operational equivalent in Scandinavia and an operational equivalent in the UK (local campaigners are finding that those in the UK can’t sell their power).\nAre you aware that the UK’s statutory regulatory regime for air pollution (in which the council has placed its trust) is widely regarded as unfit for purpose? The Health Protection Agency is about to undertake research into whether or not it can substantiate the assurances and claims it has been making and upon which the Environment Agency and numerous councils have historically relied. Is the council aware of the potential damage it could do to its own Environment Capital “aspiration” if, as widely expected, it can’t?\nDo you know enough about air pollution and monitoring in the city? Does Peterborough monitor anything other than road traffic? Where are the monitoring stations and are they in the right places? What regime is planned for when the incinerator is operational?\nHave you considered the social, health and cost impacts on the city of a mass burn incinerator in an area with very high (and rising) levels of social deprivation?\nAre you aware that a new incinerator on an industrial site in Fletton is operating and is apparently making people ill, but that the council has not done anything about it, and that not one person amongst the “officers’ panel” and members present at the Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee Call in Meeting on 29th August was equipped to advise the ward councillor who asked about this problem in his ward? I understand that the ward councillor had been told by the Environment Agency that it was a matter for the council. As a member of the public I witnessed that not a single person actually knew how to deal with this relatively small problem – nobody offered to look into it or explain who the ward councillor should talk to, if it wasn’t the Environment Agency. This is despite the presence of senior council officers and (at least) three lawyers.\nAre you satisfied with the monitoring and regulation of pollution in the city?\nPlease can Richard Olive have answers to the questions which Peterborough Friends of the Earth has asked the council on this matter?\nCan you write NONE against – or otherwise provide detail of any personal, family or party interest you have had, have or are likely to have – in any of the following:\n- the council’s Energy Services Company?\n- “Blue Sky”?\n- this sector?\n- this decision?\nI look forward to hearing from you, etc.\nExcellent work, fiona! Keep going….!\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_09_24_council-or-bank-manager/content_361.html": "The city council claims to be under pressure to get its plans for Fletton Quays built. It is so anxious about this that it plans to decant itself from its own rather lovely Town Hall in Bridge Street so that it can rent out the space and encourage companies to join it on the other side of the river in a patch of land which would make a lovely river park or walkway and serve as a rain shed for the city, even a flood plain, if we were thinking in a truly sustainable way about what a river bank really is.\nThe nature of this pressure is not fully understood. At least I don’t understand it: I simply don’t share it, and given the amount of empty space available in the city, residential, retail and commercial, I admit to being bewildered.\nI am wondering also if the nature of the pressure is a bit more complicated and also whether the council isn’t so much being pressurised, as positively rushed into what could be a potentially very damaging decision. A decision is scheduled to be made at 10am on Monday morning. Are we sure we understand what the rush is all about?\nA few of us have been looking at the detail behind the company the council is planning to lend money to: Norlin Hotels Holdings Limited.\n(see: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/news/council/council-set-to-support-hotel-construction-on-fletton-quays/\nNorlin Hotels Holdings Limited turns out to be one of a huge network of companies and a couple of people have spent a day or two hunting for assets, a history of solid achievement, or anything to reassure us that this is a good thing. So far we haven’t come across much to reassure us. In fact warning lights are flashing everywhere.\nThe company is based in Northern Ireland. One of its directors is Stephen Brian Symington.\nWhy would Peterborough not opt for a local developer? Local builders? A local workforce? Is the company it is talking to really based in Northern Ireland, or is it just an address?\nI remember talking to people working on the academy building project and they told me that they came up from London every day by bus. One of the men I spoke to had only recently arrived from Africa which really got me thinking about the nature of the investment and exactly how it was managed and who benefited most from the choice of workforce. Looking back now, I wonder what would this man have done if his manager wanted to skimp on wall ties, for example? What were his skills? How well qualified was he? Was he in a position to probe something if it did worry him? Was his immigration status a problem for him? Could this put him in difficulties in negotiations with an employer? There is no evidence of a problem like the wall tie scandal happening in Peterborough, but a wall certainly did collapse for want of a few ties in Scotland. What complicated decisions led to that? We need to stop assuming that everything is done for our benefit and we need to start asking basic questions.\nWhat was the tender process? Who got involved?\nWho benefits from the decision to appoint a Northern Irish developer?\nWho is the developer? What do we know about them? Why is Peterborough, home of bricks, having to go so far to find a builder? Why is the council, which is so keen to focus on a “circular economy” not focussing locally and looking at people who have been educated and trained locally? Shouldn’t we be shortening the distances workers need to travel to find work?\nThen I see “Antigua” in an associated company’s name and I start thinking about tax havens. Quite a bit of Peterborough is now owned by offshore companies. This lowers the tax revenue available to central government. Has this got something to do with the city’s choice of company? What is the council’s approach to companies domiciled in a tax haven?\nAnd then since June it simply is not possible to ignore the heaviest political pressure on the Conservatives. Since the General Election, the Conservative Party has been and remains totally dependent on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to maintain its grip on power in Westminster. It is unlikely that the support is provided freely: the DUP is not known for being soft or a push over. Northern Ireland politicians will be trying to get as much out of this situation as they possibly can: and rightly so. But then, how exactly are they doing this? Could there be a party political aspect to the council’s choice of company? Is leverage being applied? If so is the council in a position to understand that sort of pressure, and to fully understand any risks which might be entailed?\nCould this really be all about moving money or debt around in ways which are made to be difficult to observe? As appears to have happened for entirely political reasons here.\nThe key issue is risk. What risks is the council running and has it got its eyes fully open to potential risks?\nI’ve spent the whole day (unpaid) searching for evidence that these two directors are experts in developing hotels. I haven’t found it. Others have had exactly the same experience. I’ve looked at all the active companies which have Symington or Irwin as a director. I’ve discovered that these two directors work closely together, that this set of companies is large and some are involved fun in the food industry, the racing sector, one or two are in the movie sector and that quite a few of them don’t file their accounts on time and several owe money to all sorts of financial institutions. Eastonville Investments Limited is controlled by a company based in the Cayman Islands, so I have no idea if the assets I was expecting to find are stashed safely and invisibly over there. I still think the organisation the council is talking to (which I still can’t really see as a functioning entity online – no website, for example or contact details) should be able to get a commercial bank loan if they have a viable business in our city, which I very very strongly doubt they do have, especially since they are hooked in to the old model of a hotel, rather than the fantastically popular AirB&B concept. The only company which has bothered with a website appears to be in biotech and has not thrived. Even if the hotel is a brilliant success, what impact will it have on the hotel sector already in the city? One hotel has already become infamous for housing Peterborough’s steadily growing homeless population. Is the Hilton chain really wanting to come to Peterborough?\nIf it goes wrong, the council will end up owing money against land it currently owns outright and owes nothing on, but which could fall dramatically in value in relation to any loaned amount borrowed against it. If that were to happen, the council tax payer will pick up the bill. Cllr David Seaton has honourably promised to resign if it does go pear shaped, but, frankly, resignation won’t cost him £15M.\nOne of the directors of Cawlands has demonstrated an ability to make the best of a very tough economic and political situation but however clever his recovery of property in a downturn was, I’m not sure that our council should be blowing the sort of bubbles into our local economy which could positively contribute to inflation of or a collapse in asset value.\nNor do I believe that our local council should in any way be in the business of baling out a bit of Northern Irish commercial property. The registered address of a network of companies, including the one which the council is proposing to deal with is 41-43 Waring Street, Belfast, County Antrim, BT1 2DY. And Waring Street Limited is also the name of a company. This is what that address looks like on google maps:",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_02_27_palmer-apology/content_104.html": "Palmer Admits Government has Failed our Area\nJames Palmer is the Conservative candidate expecting to be crowned Mayor of the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on May 4th. Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nFirstly, Peterborough is BIGGER than Cambridge.\nI occasionally make just this point and people look at me as if I was mad. But yes it has been for a while and it still is. I’ve just double checked last census data available on Wikipedia:\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarked gets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn order to make something perfectly clear to your colleagues in a democratic forum it is a legal requirement to declare your interests. It is a criminal offence not to, if it happens to be a pecuniary interest. For some obscure reason, this requirement appears not to have been applied (at least by means of a publicly accessible document) by our Local Enterprise Partnership, until the MP complained. The Register is now available online and forms part of a section on Corporate Governance.\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nMeanwhile I’d love to know what you think.\nAnd if you happen to live in Chatteris or in Wisbech, I hope you vote for Julie too!\nFiona, the whole Cambs and Pbo devo deal is distinctly dodgy. We are being forced to accept second best because Gillian wants to stay as CEO of both Pbo city and Cambs county!!!!\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2022_10_24_bourges-boulevard-floods-again/content_141.html": "It is remarkable that Peterborough City Council and Anglian Water can’t seem to get together to clear and improve drainage on Bourges Boulevard just south of the roundabout at Town Bridge. Flooding at this location often happens in very heavy rain and is reported in the local paper, which used to have its big blue sign on a fancy modern office overlooking the roundabout. (The Peterborough Telegraph has since moved out of the city centre.)\nSo what is going wrong?\nAre Anglian Water and the City Council not talking to one another?\nIt seems maybe not. This is not the only location in the city blighted by what looks like an inter authority communication problem.\nFlooding can follow observations of bad smells. It did this time: a reader notes this in a comment to the article. A smell of sewage is a big signal that drains might be blocked somewhere.\nSo are people not reporting poo pongs to Anglian Water?\nWell, oddly, it isn’t possible to report or describe this particular phenomenon accurately using Anglian Water’s ludicrously coy website. There is no free text field on its reporting forms, and every option avoids any mention of the blocking or the contents of sewers.\nI recently tried to report this problem at a different location and stumbled across this inexplicable reporting obstacle. The closest to a poo-stink-likely-to-be-a-drainage-problem I was able to report referred me to the “local drainage authority” (which in Peterborough is Peterborough City Council). Anglian Water’s reporting system also asks for my water account details, which are as relevant to a drainage problem wherever I happen to find it as my inside leg measurement. So, a bit cross, I rang them up. I know this is inadequate, but it is all I can recommend at the moment. So\nIf you smell poo, do a number one and a number two:\none: telephone Anglian Water on 0345 145 145\nand\ntwo: phone Peterborough City Council on 01733 747474\nIf anyone can identify a not so intrusive email address for Anglian Water, please put it in the comments, below. If you are happy to provide details of your personal water account (if you have one) when reporting an issue in the public realm you can report it using Anglian Water’s online form.\nIs Peterborough City Council a competent drainage authority?\nI’m not sure that the council is aware that when Peterborough Development Corporation handed its brief and assets over to the council, that package included drainage assets and all drainage authority responsibilities. The drainage boards outside the boundary of the council can be found online and there is local democratic involvement in their management: they are active and if there were to be a problem there is a democratic remedy available to local people. Peterborough City Council seems to think that if it ignores them, its drainage assets will look after themselves. This is certainly what happened in Park Ward, when a development on, and its “foundations” in a drain was permitted and the council remarkably failed to assert ownership of the drainage ditch (which it nevertheless clears from time to time). The development made the ditch less manageable and this resulted in a viable long term prospective asset owner walking away. But whatever its position since PDC handed drainage over to it, it has not been able to evade its responsibilities since 2010, when a law was enacted:\n“County and Unitary Authorities have been made Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs) under the Flood & Water Management Act 2010 with responsibilities to prepare and maintain a strategy for local flood risk management in their areas; maintain a register of flood management assets; investigate significant local flooding incidents; issue consents for altering, removing or replacing certain structures or features on ordinary watercourses (outside of Internal Drainage Districts) and play a lead role in emergency planning and recovery after a flood event.” https://www.ada.org.uk/member_type/local-authorities/\nAre Peterborough’s elected members aware of the council’s inherited drainage responsibilities?\nEvidence that they do is welcome.\nIs Peterborough City Council adequately funded to manage its drainage responsibilities?\nLegacy funding was never made available to the council when PDC was abruptly removed from continuing its work to develop and improve Peterborough. This explains the council’s ongoing difficulties funding the maintenance of the landscape the PDC built, including the Green Wheel. Central government has owed the city development infrastructure legacy funding since PDC left. In better economic times, it might have been possible to blur this. But now that the council is up against predictably far heavier rain (due to climate change) and impossible cuts (due to appalling decisions by central government), it makes sense now to claim what’s been due. The city has two MPs. The two of them should be able to do this for the city. They should also know whether other unitary authorities are also owed this funding.\nSo, until I find evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that no, it isn’t.\nIs Peterborough City Council competent to manage drainage and sewer works?\nI welcome evidence that it is. The prevalence of sewage pongs suggests it isn’t. As do the reports listed on the Anglian Water website, which lists long standing sewer repairs still not completed.",

Venues for Hustings – for Candidates 2015\nPeterborough’s best hustings are often held in churches or schools. These can be public or closed events. Hustings they can be held anywhere and by any organisation. A school event is particularly interesting: because children often see politics as something which only happens on the television or on the radio. You are never too young to vote. You are never too young to debate a issue.\nThe person hosting the hustings will probably need a candidate to apply for one of these venues. The legislation (statute) governing this provision is the Representation of the People Act.\nThis hustings will happen later this week and there are rules (below the picture) about how to ask a question. The organisation of the hustings is up to the host.\nClick here for further details about the St Johns hustings\nI have never attended a hustings which got out of hand (close, but the well behaved sixth formers and their teachers worked hard to persuade candidates perhaps not to resort to fisticuffs). A calm, friendly and firm person in the chair will help ensure a hustings keeps its hair on. However the history of violence and intimidation within and working against the British democratic process is substantial and centuries old. This is well understood by parliament itself. So to help keep things peaceful and calm, legislation makes a police presence available to hustings organisers if they feel they need one. A very important, but perhaps not well understood statutory duty of the police is to uphold the democratic process, of which the hustings form a very important important part.",

Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarkedgets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.",

And a massive black cloud did come along and snowed on us and one very delighted little girl. Hail followed. But we stayed warm (oddly, it wasn’t all that cold). And we kept posting leaflets into letterboxes. But it was one of those days when focussing on broken bins and flytipped furniture and electrics was particularly difficult. The ghastly truth is that people (including me) get used to rubbish in their environment and we literally have no choice but to keep moving: to pass it by. We’d never do anything if we dealt with every bit. But sometimes the weather and the lovely stuff steals the show and that is what this afternoon was like. So here’s a photo narrative. The moon was in at least three photos, but now I can only find it in one. I stumbled on a beautiful red camellia in full flower in a south facing garden and some pelargoniums: they looked a bit dry but warm and also in full bloom but I didn’t photograph them.",

It met to decide whether or not to call-in the decision made by Deputy Leader Councillor Matthew Lee (CONSERVATIVE) to make Viridor the preferred bidder to run the council’s planned incinerator (Lot 1).\nThe members of this committee are:\n- Councillor Marion Todd (Chairman)\n- Councillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman)\n- Councillor Mohammed Nadeem\n- Councillor Yasmeen Maqbool\n- Councillor Stuart Martin\n- Councillor Nick Thulbourn\n- Councillor Judy Fox\n- Councillor Dale McKean (Reserve)\n- Councillor Lisa Forbes (Reserve)\n- Councillor Chris Ash (Reserve) (source: Peterborough City Council)\nCllr Maqbool had given advance notice of her absence and Cllr Dale McKean attended in her place.\nAt the end of about four hours of lengthy, soporific, off topic but occasionally revelatory proceedings the committee decided 4 to 3 to reject the request for a call-in.\nVoted AGAINST calling in the decision (and therefore supporting Cllr Lee’s decision)\nCouncillor Marion Todd (Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Mohammed Nadeem CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Dale McKean (Reserve) CONSERVATIVE\nVoted FOR calling in the decision (and supporting reference back to Full Council or decision maker, but unable to vote for either option since the other vote took place first)\nCouncillor Stuart Martin LABOUR\nCouncillor Nick Thulbourn LABOUR\nCouncillor Judy Fox INDEPENDENT\nThe meeting began at 6pm with Apologies and Declaration of Interests. No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.\nScrutiny committee doesn’t ask if disclosure could be in the public interest\nA meeting of a committee with a very long name: Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee held on Wednesday 13th June, 2012 at 7.00 pm Bourges Viersen Room, Town Hall. may turn out to be the last committee able to interrogate or discuss Peterborough City Council’s plans to build an incinerator, a so-called “Energy from Waste (EfW) plant” before an executive decision is taken by the deputy leader in consultation with the Waste 2020 Project Board (whose recommendations and minutes I believe are not published – please put a link in a comment if you find them!). If this committee does not “call-in” the decision the council is expected to proceed with incineration plans which still can’t be examined by the public.\nDocuments showing council’s current thinking and a brief history of its proposal for an EfW plant has been circulated to councillors. These documents reveal that fears which have often been expressed about the city’s recycling (how it does it and how much it does) and even bigger worries about incineration replacing recycling could well be justified.\nThe EfW plant was discussed at ITEM 5. Waste 2020 Programme- Energy from Waste Facility And Other Associated Works and Services Part of the discussion was to be “exempt”. The agenda item reads as follows, although the highlighting is mine:\n“In accordance with Standing Orders, Members are asked to determine whether the update report to be tabled at the meeting relating to agenda item 5. Waste 2020 Programme – Energy From Waste Facility which contains exempt appendices containing information relating to the financial or business affairs of a particular person (including the authority holding that information), as defined by Paragraph 3 of Schedule 12A of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1972, should be exempt and the press and public excluded from the meeting when these appendices are discussed or whether the public interest in disclosing this information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.”\nI asked from the public seating area that members be given the opportunity to vote on excluding members of the public because the chair seemed to be telling us to leave at the outset of ITEM 5 and without any vote. They were then allowed to vote. The chair also had to be persuaded by council officers that part of ITEM 5 could be discussed in public and that the exclusion could follow discussion of that part rather than apply to the whole item.\nHowever no discussion took place in this committee on the relative merits of the “public interest in disclosing” as opposed to the “public interest in maintaining the exemption” and it was not clear to me that members of the committee understood that standing orders provided them with an opportunity to debate the relative pros and cons of sharing the information with the public. The chair of the committee refused to let me raise this.\nThe public interest in disclosing is overwhelming in my view. I believe that this committee was led by its chair into a breach of its own standing orders by not having any debate about where the balance of public interest lay: whether it was better for the city to have disclosure or not. Members of the committee were simply not asked to contribute their thoughts on the subject or debate it before they were asked to vote.\nFor some members of the newly formed opposition (Independent/Labour) this was their first time sitting on this committee. I don’t know how they felt but I was in a state of mild shock by the time we were thrown out.\nPeterborough City Council’s call-in procedure\nrequires two members of a scrutiny committee to complete a form explaining the reasons for a call-in (eg failure to follow due process). The affected committee (the one within whose remit the decision takes place) then has to meet within 10 days to uphold the call-in or recommend action.\nOther councils’ procedures: Hackney Hertsmere Laudably, Thurrock Council provides for both its elected Members and the public to call-in these decisions prior to implementation.\nPeterborough has “suspended” its own call-in procedure on four occasions in 2005\nCo-minglers might have to prove quality of result\nA number of local authorities, including Peterborough co-mingle recyclables in a single collection.\nOther authorities collect each recyclable item separately.\nIn 2008 this was demonstrated to be better value, since the end product is more likely to fetch a good price.\nThe Campaign for Real Recycling is challenging the asssumption so far made:\nthat co-mingled collections of paper, metal, plastics and glass produces a quality result.\nhttp://www.realrecycling.org.uk/news/news39.php\nA judicial review hearing will be held in Cardiff, starting on 14th December 2011.\nPeterborough for Responsible Waste Management fights for good quality recycling.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_04_19_peterboroughs-nappy-app/content_531.html": "Yesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.\nThis is very inspiring. I’m just about to start delivering my election leaflets in Orton Waterville ward. The weather is looking good today, but it can change very quickly in this part of Peterborough (and back again, thankfully). I’m in no danger of smashing your PB, but if I can get through it without major injury to fingers, knees or feet (and lose some more weight, which has been happening consistently since I joined Peterborough Green Party) I shall be satisfied.\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_05_07_what-happened/content_585.html": "Why did huge Photo ID queues build up so late on election night?\nAs a candidate, my job on election night is to wait for the ballot box to come in and to be present at the count. This is how candidates respect the voter’s voice. The ballot box contains the ballots and on their ballot papers are the choices of voters, speaking and expressing their wishes on the one day they are allowed to vote. Candidates observe their counts. We see what they say.\nThe first of Park Ward’s ballot boxes (Madeley House polling station) came in in reasonable time. The second ballot box (All Saints polling station) came in very late indeed, apparently owing to a long queue building up due to the Photo ID check. Queue tickets were issued to those in the queue at 10pm. This was clearly not expected to be a big thing by polling staff, who, when I left them had already been on duty for thirteen and a half hours, with only on-site breaks. The third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am. I do not know how long polling staff had been at their posts by the time they were discharged from their duties, nor in what state they were. Polling staff are not permitted to leave the polling station while they are on duty and although they are all prepared for a 15 -16 hour shift, which is already an outrageously long working day, they certainly do not expect to be on duty very much beyond 10pm. I am wondering how many polling staff had to endure a 20 hour working day extending beyond Thursday 4th May into the early hours of the 5th.\nIt is true that PhotoID was trialled. But the very small trials were failures.\nUK government implemented the legislation despite the pilots’ failures.\nBallot boxes are normally handed over to the transport soon after 10pm and will usually arrive about an hour later. This year Peterborough City Council could not afford huge numbers of high security transit vehicles (the trucks looked like refrigerated container trucks) so some polling station staff at the eighty polling stations open at this year’s local election (there will be more polling stations for next year’s elections) will have had to wait for one of the five trucks waiting for a hold up somewhere else. I do not know how many polling stations were impacted by delays occurring in Park Ward. Nor do I know if other wards were themselves affected by late long queues.\nI cannot physically be in two places at once and all my team was already with me at the Town Hall. So, what I want to know is exactly what happened at the All Saints and St Georges polling stations. The advice I was given by polling staff was that the dinner time rush which usually starts between 5pm and 6pm was already dying down. Something clearly changed from the ward’s normal voting behaviour. How come? Why did such long queues form so late in the voting window?\nWere you in one of the queues? Please describe what happened.\nYou can comment below, or you can contact me privately.\nI’ve subsequently found out that that what looked like refrigerated transport trucks were there to provide temporary storage for the bulky furniture which had to be removed from the Town Hall rooms used for the count. (Forli, Bourges Viersen, Reception and Council Chamber.) Also that the ballot boxes arrived in count staff cars and had to queue around Car Haven Car Park.\nLikeLike",

They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked. Something has to be very seriously wrong: when nobody\n- understands the process\n- bothers to explain it\n- knows what it is or\n- why it is there\nWhy does nobody ever challenge this preposterous pile of garbage? If someone fly-tipped vomit soaked nappies all over Cllr Nick Sandford (Liberal Democrat), would he actually mind? I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\n- lack of transparency (no figures available to the residents of Peterborough and – because I couldn’t ask my second question the audience was able to rest secure in the assumption – to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) himself.\n- treatment of farmers (I’ll expand for him here: the council’s first communication to 18 farmers was to warn them that they would be evicted if the plan went ahead)\n- risk of a change in the subsidy regime: no safety plan if the government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) changes the regime governing ROCs (again no discussion: no explanation)\n- no contingency fund if the sums are wrong\n- conflict with government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) policy on renewables (this was not explained at all)\n- has no plan B (if I may expand any decent proposal presents alternatives, preferably a well thought out range of options)\n- didn’t even know which brownfield sites it owned\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this. I think Peterborough should be enthusiastically refusing to reduce its tenanted farm land holdings.\nOnce Paul Stainton said they were starting to wind up and I still hadn’t succeeding in asking any of my questions I decided that since I wasn’t actually required as a speaking participant, as I had expected, I wasn’t going to be part of any awful preorganised tedious windbag wind up. So I left and expressed my feelings as clearly as I possibly could (being at that point absolutely livid) to David Murray, radio editor.\nSo what questions would I have asked? I had two: the first was in response to Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative). I wanted to ask him (and I’ll be honest I really wanted to ask this in front of a rolling TV camera):\n- Can you explain why you are not sure exactly how much income the solar voltaic array on the Freemans building is bringing in and why should anyone trust your figures if you are in the slightest bit uncertain on this point?\nAnd the other one was to Stewart Jackson. I wanted to ask him:\n- Whether or not public authorities (including Peterborough City Council) don’t have to disclose to our elected representative in parliament whatever information is requested of them and to confirm that he does actually have all the figures because he has asked the city council for them and they have been obliged to disclose them.\nPlease go to @PaulStainton or https://twitter.com/PaulStainton for more and use hashtag #solardebate\nPlease comment here if you don’t tweet or want more space\nHi Fiona,\nThank you for the email about that t***** S Jackson – under orders from above no doubt.\nThere is no doubt a lot of money and influence being applied by vested interests in the present unsustainable system.\nOn a happier note, please see attached a poster for our Christmas Party on Fri 2oth Dec, where all new starters go FREE J\nYou are warmly invited to join us, along with any friends that could do with a fun evening out J\nPlease advertise the event for us, if you can, as the more people attend, the better the atmosphere J\nBest wishes,\nAlan\nLikeLike",

That is why I wrote about the sensation of falling which is how the shock of the allegations first affected me.\nI have been too busy out and about campaigning to write much about this story but while I’ve been busy a great deal has happened. This post is an update and a pulling together of threads.\nThe council can’t do anything\nFirstly in response to a number of points and questions I communicated to the council’s leader and chief executive officer, the council has explained its position with respect to removing an elected representative:\n“The legal position is that all democratically elected councillors, are entitled as of right to attend all meetings of full council. There is no power for officers or members to remove that right.”\nSo while “Jessica” believes that Coles should resign as a city councillor (and I wholeheartedly support her call) I don’t think that anybody can force that to happen. If Coles continues not to resign, it seems that he can’t be pushed.\nHis party won’t do anything\nI believe that a decent political party would have suspended Coles already, pending clarification of his situation. However his party is the Conservative Party which is in power and which has been close to being in power for a century. It is an integral part of the establishment which has used the police to target over 1,000 organisations, including my own political party, my party’s only MP and my party’s only member of the House of Lords. This is why I personally have no expectations that the Conservative Party will even worry about behaving decently: that simply isn’t what the party or the British establishment is about. They are about power full stop. If they did suspend or expel him I would expect him to opt to remain in post as an independent councillor. This may be more of a worry to them than his remaining in post. The horrible question which then arises is where are the other 120 ex spy cops and how do their current networks, contacts, employments or appointments help to protect their secrets and abuses or those of others and to what extent and how might such arrangements be tolerated or even organised? Let’s not underestimate the usefulness of professional, political and cultural networks. Cllr Coles is one of the best connected people in Peterborough.\nThree investigations are underway: none of which stop him talking\nBack to fast moving present reality. There are now three investigations or cases ongoing. As far as I am aware none of these require Coles to maintain silence on the allegations: his silence is entirely a matter of personal choice, not of contractual or legal obligation. I am as ever happy to be corrected.\n1 A civil case is now underway at the Metropolitan Police Service’s Legal Directorate.\nThere have been rumours on social media of an out of court settlement. This gossip is not true.\n2 “Jessica” has been admitted as a core participant into the Undercover Policing Inquiry (UCPI)\n3 The Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel will consider the referral back from the IPCC\nThe Independent Police and Complaints Commission (IPCC soon to be IOPC) responded to a FOI request in the following terms:\nwhich at first glance looks as if the IPCC is not investigating and did not investigate. But if you check what the IPCC does and how it does it, it is perfectly possible that this interpretation is not quite correct. IPCC can supervise local investigations without actually doing them. This statement does not eliminate the possibility that it could be involved in supervising a Cambridgeshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (Cambridgeshire OPCC or here just OPCC) investigation which hasn’t started yet. As for regulations, here is something which may or may not help in understanding what they are and what will or won’t happen next.\nIn order to understand what has or hasn’t happened here, it would be necessary to see both referrals and to form a judgement about their sufficiency or otherwise. It would also be necessary to understand whether these referrals relate only to Coles’ behaviour while he was applying for or occupying the post of Cambridgeshire Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner (as I strongly suspect is the case).\nMeanwhile the local paper indicates that the Cambridgeshire OPCC has delegated the investigation to the Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel. This body meets next on 6th September. The agenda for that meeting is not yet online, but it should be available on the 1st at the latest.\nWe really do need to know what Coles’ motives were in going for the role of Deputy PCC and we need to know everything about who knew the whats and the whys about that appointment.",

I had made a note to check where it would be on Friday (tomorrow) when there is a chance to witness a near total solar eclipse. People have made plans and some have plotted parties and bought cameras, filters, projectors and protective eye wear, ready for the big day.\nInstead we have “fog”. This is a polite word for particulate laden and polluted air. It might be a lot more accurate to call it “smog”. Yesterday it almost lifted just after lunch and shafts of sunlight penetrated into the city centre. Today we have what looks like heavy cloud. But it is more likely that the smog has simply floated up a bit. The government website is predicting worse pollution levels on Friday than today.\nI joined the Green Party in 2007 as I tried to reverse Peterborough City Council’s decision to support the incineration of domestic waste. This was a battle which we campaigners lost. We saw a neighbouring proposal fall in the face of a far more successful campaign. Lessons were learned, as they say. And I started to consider the vexed question of what exactly drives politics in Peterborough.\nA key supporter of incineration of waste is Cllr Marco Cereste (he is also a director of Peterborough Renewable Energy Limited which builds slightly cleaner incinerators than the one the council is building). As leader of the council he personally attracts huge amounts of anger, frustration and suspicion: some of it reasonable, some of it less so. But in the last couple of weeks he has told the story of his signing (on behalf of the city he represents) a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on his facebook profile (shared with his facebook friends). This MoU is with an entity locals understand is a Chinese government funded organisation, possibly what we’d call in the UK, an “NGO” (non governmental organisation).\nThen in an online discussion elsewhere entirely about this morning’s fog, someone shared this video which I hadn’t come across previously. The story of this video’s making and removal from Chinese social media is available online. I just wish that we’d had this video at the time the council’s decision was still not made. At the notorious moment when Pam Kreling (then one of the councillors making the crucial decision about whether or not to use incineration) said words to the effect that if she couldn’t see anything emerging from a stack, then there was nothing there and there was by implication nothing which could do anyone any harm. As campaigners we weren’t allowed to speak at critical moments in meetings: in fact the chair of one of the meetings offered to have me and Richard Olive thrown out when we stood up to tell them they were being hopelessly misinformed by their advisors. But as I observed this pantomime (there was no beadle to implement the Chair’s desire) I was left reeling from a deeper revelation. I still wonder how people in key positions got through even basic level schooling, what exactly went on in their science lessons and what their marks were.",

So if you have the cash and could use that to pay, then we can keep that little bit. It all tots up, you see.”\nStartled. I paid with a note and got some coins back in my hand. I made a mental note to do something about the drift away from notes and coin. She had reminded me of something I’d forgotten.\nThen this morning I tuned into Ramblings and heard the Commoners Choir sing The Coiners Song.\nIsaac Newton got a mention in the programme for having gone after the coiners in his official capacity as Master of the Royal Mint. Coiners would snip off tiny pieces from the edges of circulating coins and they’d use the shavings to forge new ones. Counterfeiting is an age old criminal offence described here on the Royal Mint’s website.\nThis morning’s Ramblings came from Calderdale, and that is where some of the coining went on. Click the link for an article about it or hunt out the novel ‘The Gallows Pole’ by Benjamin Myers or look out for the six-part series, The Gallows Pole, which is expected to air on BBC One in 2023:\nRudyard Kipling’s poem The Coiner did not get a mention in this morning’s Ramblings. Kipling has been regarded as politically incorrect for a large part of my lifetime. But he is now being read by a post imperial generation, which seems to be able to read and to appreciate his work within the contexts of his time. I wonder what he’d have said about “card charges” and how he’d have described what the banks do to our cash each time they process our card transactions? Listen here to how his song pays tribute to the huge positive social impact the coiners had! And this probably isn’t merely the stuff of fiction, because they could not possibly have committed the crimes they did without a great many people being prepared to cooperate with them.\nCould one point thirty percent help to “wreck Britain’s economy”? And even if it couldn’t, should something be done about it? Anyone got an idea? Legal, of course.\nThe card company is providing a service so will charge someone-shopper or shopkeepers. Cash transactions are fine but can also be more easily hidden from tax man, perhaps used to pay a cash in hand employee consequently with no workers rights. There are certain places that only take cash, the shopkeepers could do that, or have a minimum spend, or even pass on the cost to the customer now we’ve left the EU protection against such things! To me this charge is a cost of doing business\nLikeLike\nInteresting perspective. I agree about the legitimacy of a charge for the provision of a service. What surprises me is the level of the charge. I think it is high. The volumes must be enormous.\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_04_17_report-on-local-election-hustings/content_654.html": "held in Park Ward on 16th April\nSome people were disappointed at the turnout at yesterday’s candidate hustings at the Willow Cafe in Park Ward, but top community activists tell me that “the people who turn up to things are the right people”.\nThe event was hosted by Park Streets Ahead Residents Association and hosted by Beki Sellick (in her capacity as Chair).\nI was making a cup of tea this morning and it dawned on me that there had been a disproportionately high number of sustainable transport professionals in the room. That speaks to ongoing safety and speeding issues in Park Ward and it tallies with despair on the doorstep that the well understood underlying problems persist unfixed. In fact if we rearranged the chairs in the room, we probably had the skills right there in the room to fix the problem. What these experts don’t have (as things stand) is the council’s ear. Once again, it is often the case that the solutions are not somewhere else: we’ve likely got them right here, in Park Ward.\nCandidates on the ballot paper turned up, with the exception of the Labour and Reform candidates.\n| ARFAN Khan | address is on ballot | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| ASIF Muhammad | (address in Peterborough) | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| HARDMAN Ian | address is on ballot | Liberal Democrat |\n| HUSSAIN Junayd | (address in Peterborough) | Labour & Co-operative Party |\n| MORRIS Sue | (address in Peterborough) | Reform UK |\n| RADIC Fiona | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| WILSON Steve | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| YASIN Sabra | (address in Peterborough) | Labour Party |\nThe full list for all wards is here.\nAttending in the audience, were just the right number of loud voices. True, many people didn’t say anything, but, for whatever reason, they decided not to speak.\nIt was not a scary event. There were no fights and I did not spot intimidation. However, I took one concern expressed to the host at face value and will catch up with this (and them) as and when I can.\nI have come across electoral malpractices including intimidation which is a known (but I believe increasingly historic) problem in Park Ward and it is one of the reasons why CCTV cameras are frequently installed outside some or all of Park’s polling stations. I am aware of various pressures which have been applied over the years to voters in Park Ward (they tell me about shocking things going on in the past). Most of these pressures are “normal” family, social or party influences and feelings of obligation, which are part of normal life and a functioning democracy. But once a person feels they are being bullied, losing their right to choose freely or even having their vote stolen, voters and candidates shouldn’t hesitate to call the police or Electoral Services at the council (who can work out what the problem might be and will liaise with the police if necessary).\nJohn Peach in the middle of the room does not (in my book) constitute intimidation: his body language and his Cheshire Cat grin said louder than words how much enjoyed the event (announced on the 5th), despite failing to invite his online newsletter readers (emailed on the 8th) across the ward to it. Probably a communication problem rather than a deliberate omission.\nThere was disappointment expressed by a couple of people at the event’s format, which was cabaret layout for the audience and mingling for candidates, designed to facilitate more personal encounters. The room has a lovely but hard floor so for the hard of hearing one speaker at a time would work, whereas two voices would blur each other out. There was a very good (but also very well resourced) accessible hustings held during Peterborough’s parliamentary by-election in 2019.\nIt is worth pointing out that the traditional format (high table at the top for the candidates and seats for the public arranged as if for a theatre show – like BBC Question Time) does allow for the person who wants to ask a question to take the floor and, if they want to, to command the room. This can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues . It also allows for a bit of tit for tat between candidates and lets them demonstrate (and develop and practice) any debating skills they have: very likely to come in handy if elected.\nThe event was recorded by an unknown individual at the back who didn’t ask permission or make himself known to the host. I have no idea if the recording will go anywhere: but I doubt it. Shout if you spot it.\nNobody took names of attendees or pictures. It was probably the least “posed” hustings I’ve attended and that makes a pleasant change.\nSo, in summary all good. Thank you Park Streets Ahead for the invitation. And well done, Beki Sellick for doing very well the incredibly tough job of chairing.\nI got a great deal out of attending and personally enjoyed it very much. I learned many things, including that when the awesome Rosemary was elected the youngest ever female councillor in Scotland, her campaign had focussed on housing and the position of wardrobes in bedroom layouts. Presumably at a time of massive council house building. I shall have to catch up with her again to find out more. Something else on the list for after the election.",

And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nThe Cambridge News published some of what I said along with a photo .\nPeterborough Telegraph believes the financial burden will fall upon the tenants of the block. I believe that this would be profoundly wrong and I will set out why in this second update.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nthat the approved planning application according to which the block was to be constructed is 96/00001/FUL | Validated: Mon 07 Oct 1996 | Status: Decided\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nBehind the sheeting is sand. Here is similar material taken from a picture about a road being built on the construction company’s Facebook page. This may or may not be what is behind the steel sheeting too.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.",

This visit formed one of a number of visits to the region’s growing number of food banks by members of the European Green Team in the run up to the European elections on 22nd May. Our team has reported on Hunger in the East.\nThe Ramsey foodbank is based at St Thomas a Becket on Ramsey High Street and it works as part of the network of Trussell Trust foodbanks which now serve no fewer than fourteen communities throughout Cambridgeshire.\n“I arrived with me lots of grand ideas and optimism. Less than a week before my visit I had been at the opening of a new food cooperative in Peterborough which has huge ambitions to change the way we shop and eat in the city. I am talking to growers and makers and I am often around people who jar and pot things.\n“When I arrived in Ramsey the market town sitting in an area of rich arable land was particularly green and beautiful, and lush with recent rain. The harsh realities of hunger in an area which is so very rich agriculturally brought me down to earth and made me think.”\nWHY EMPTY KITCHEN CUPBOARDS IN RAMSEY?\nRev’d Gita Bond, who manages the Ramsey project explained that “The foodbank provides an emergency food supply for people without an income or on an income so low that they cannot afford food. Its clientele is identified by one of a dozen different agencies as in need of emergency food. They are issued with a voucher.”\nThe food bank relies on ongoing donations from parishioners and residents and it is also on the lookout for people who can deliver donations to people who are not mobile or who live further away.\nGita didn’t need to explain about the tea and biscuit which awaits volunteers: a group of people were talking and organising all manner of things around a busy and welcoming table. The church works with a wide range of community groups and there is a warm welcome for everybody.\nFoodbanks have proliferated because successive governments have failed and failed and failed again to tackle poverty wages.\nThe costs of living rise and people in work find their pay stands still and it is impossible to pay all the bills and put food on the table. People earning poverty pay are a growing part of those turning to food banks for help.\nPeople not in work for various reasons are more obviously vulnerable to hunger. But they are also victims of ideologically motivated and regressive government decisions.\nThe Green Party disapproves very strongly of the Department of Work and Pensions’ “sanctions” regime, which literally removes the welfare safety net from vulnerable claimants. Although a sanction can later be removed, a hunger gap opens up immediately. If the person falling into that hunger gap is lucky, they might get help from the foodbank.\n“Worries have recently been expressed to me that employees in the DWP may be being prevented by their line managers from identifying and referring people who need food immediately.”\n“We need an immediate change in government policy. Policy has gone back to before the second world war: we had malnutrition then and it is shameful that it has come back.\n“And on the ground, regardless of who gets elected on 22nd May, we need to figure out how we can improve our food resilience.\n“I was both impressed and horrified. I could see that almost all the food in the store is processed and packaged and it needs to be like that in order to have a reasonably long shelf life. Consequently there is nothing fresh at all. If someone donates something with a source of protein in it, such as a tin of fish or meatballs it can be issued. But if what is received is nutritionally unbalanced or poor, or all if all the donations are pasta, then that is all the foodbank can issue.\n“I suspect that what happens is that someone steps in: I bet it is someone with very limited means themselves, but it will be someone who cares. Communities work like this: but it is awful that they have to. But I am so very impressed with what they do manage to achieve despite the problems.\n“What I simply don’t understand is why we accept this system. Isn’t it insane for a country as wealthy as ours to function in this miserable way?\nCALL TO RETAIL CHAINS TO HELP\nThe Green Party is urging retail chains with outlets in the Ramsey area to make small regular donations of suitable items. A list is available from the foodbank.\n“But beyond these immediate calls for help, we are urging food processors to identify and minimise food waste. I sometimes hear about large amounts of perfectly edible food being dumped in Cambridgeshire: some of it destined for landfill (because it has been packaged and it is not worth unpacking it). Some of it goes for composting. In fact I heard a little while ago that on a farm close to Ramsey supermarket reject tomatoes were being composted. They might be the wrong colour or shape. This is not sustainable: this is not right.\n“It is high time we got this edible fresh food quickly to people who want and need good quality local food. I am perfectly happy to go and talk to a producer or a shop myself about what goes wrong in our broken food systems and how we can work to tackle hunger. I think the co-existence of food waste and hunger demonstrates that the food economy is not working efficiently. This is not good for consumers, but it doesn’t do any good to local farmers or food producers either.\nPeterborough to host Environment Capital Conference with Professor Hugh Montgomery on 27th February\n27th February 9am – 1pm\nAt this event to be hosted by Peterborough City Council at Kingsgate Community Church in Parnwell, Professor Hugh Montgomery will present a keynote speech on climate change. The council is hoping this event will help generate more momentum for Peterborough’s Environment Capital aspirations.\nPlaces must be booked.

Those with any hearing difficulties at all struggled, even when listening to those around the same table. The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available.

They’ve got through to the council and have been told the council is now going after “GKL”. I thought I’d established that they built the building and, presumably the embankment which has subsequently collapsed. The journalist were now being told that this entity is the property manager (which took me completely by surprise). So, RHRL is out of the picture, just for the moment. Which is interesting because as of a couple of days ago, the council’s press office were saying they were going after/in dispute/had settled with RHRL. Weren’t they? Isn’t it the name in the local paper, linked in my second update? Now why would the council’s press office have been saying that if it wasn’t true? Please note that my first assumption is absolutely not that the press office has “made a genuine error” (as claimed by Cllr Fitzgerald over the entirely unrelated cheque gate affair. But that is a whole other scandal.)\nCould this mean that the council is now chasing after a relevant, genuinely responsible entity and that maybe flat owners will not be held liable for the repairs? If so, there is hope.\nNew morning. New search.

And anyway, thinking about it, where did that story come from? And why am I aerated about the issue? Oh yes, of course: Facebook.\nI’m not sure why Cllr Fitzgerald is still blocking me.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_councillor_page_3/content_570.html": "How to get Santa back when his arrival down your chimney is threatened by UK Government Diktat. Could two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nAll children need to be told about this appalling story broken by Newsthump. Sit them down after they’ve had a good meal and read it as gently and softly as you can. Just before bed with the lights down. Don’t forget right at the end of this absolutely terrible story, to remind them that they are not allowed to vote for a change of government until they turn 18. But they can register to vote to change matters they disapprove of as soon as they turn 17.\nYour children might react by telling you not to be so silly, close their eyes and sleep, much as so often happens when you read one of the ghastliest and grimmest of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nBut if they sit up and protest against your bedtime story, here is how to suggest that they run a poll at their school. Younger doubters may ask for another story: this can’t after all, be how it all ends? Maybe an Adventure is in order? Or a Game? Tomorrow night, then.\nChildren can always run a Poll\nAt their School, Club in the Family or anywhere where there are three or more people who can be persuaded to join in. They will need to appoint an Electoral Returning Officer to run a Poll or even an Internal Election. A boring school would appoint a teacher to this role. But this would avoid about two weeks work for a whole school who could Research, Discuss, Decide and Vote on making their own Elected Officer or Appointment (could be either) from within the class (for a class poll) or a school (for a school wide poll). They’d also need to Decide (and how to do that) whether or not they can Vote in an Assembly (like Parliament) or whether they need a full scale Election, in which case they would need to Design and Manufacture their own Poll Cards, Ballot Boxes and Confidential Polling Booths, Specify the Dates and Times the Booths would be open and then Decide how to Organise the Count: Appoint Polling Staff, Appoint Counting Staff. They’d also have to Decide on the Definition of the Electorate (or determine an Electoral Boundary) and whether or not they need to Register Eligible Voters on an Electoral Register. Oh yes, they’d have to Decide on a Wording to be put on the Ballot and whether or not more than one Vote can be taken and if so, how. And whether or not a Simple Majority is the best Voting Strategy.\nThey could each run a Vote Count to find out who or what Motion has won the Poll. Offences Detected and Offences Not Detected could also be counted, by each of the smaller teams.\nTo make this slightly less deadly (nobody is pretending all this is super exciting!) for older and very bright students, maybe those with lively imaginations and career options including Crime Writer, you could have one small additional group working in a Vote Fraud Team (their Objective could be to Manipulate the Vote by whatever Illegal Means they can Concoct) and another small additional group working as an Electoral Police, working to Detect Electoral Offences. This is not recommended for children under the age of 14, who generally adhere to the Right and Wrong Theory of Everything.\nParticipants who don’t understand the Capitalised Words (there are even a couple in this Post’s Heading!) will find them Defined in Wikipedia.\nCould two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nWell, Arguably they could. Because a teacher who asks a class to Vote FOR or AGAINST an idea by asking for a Show of Hands can run a Poll in about forty seconds flat. Although, of course, that hyper efficient teacher’s class may never grasp the finer points of how elections are run (and policed) by UK governments and UK law enforcement.\nThe monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nPark Ward votes against the trend\nPark Ward gifts Prime Minister Rishi Sunak half his morning after soundbites\nBy the morning after the election, it was already clear that the Conservatives were heading for an enormous number of local election defeats. For their Chairman “good” would have been keeping that number to just one thousand. They failed. And lost many more seats than that. The monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nBut, against this trend, in Park Ward two Conservatives were elected.\nThe result for Park Ward is interesting and in voting in two Conservatives, the ward went clean against the trend in the rest of the UK, which has so far (result in Redcar & Cleveland still to come in) seen the Conservatives net a loss of 1,058 seats.\nIn Park, Conservative candidate Arfan Khan came first and will serve the ward as city councillor for four years.\nConservative Muhammad Asif, on the other hand will serve a term of only one year, since by coming second, he won the seat vacated by ex Councillor Shaz Nawaz when he resigned, and whose term would have expired in 2024.\nMost people I canvassed were very keen not to see the Conservatives take Park. A huge number of people also know that it was a Conservative led council combined with many years of Conservative national governments which have brought the city to its current crisis, a council close to bankruptcy, many residents unable to provide themselves with food or heat indoors and as soon as you step outside the unmistakeable signs of neglect, deprivation and disempowerment are unavoidable.\nA Conservative win therefore baffles many people, including me, frankly. So what happened, how, and why?\nIs it a personal, rather than a party vote\nIn Arfan Khan’s case, his vote is a personal one and, I strongly suspect, nothing to do with which party he stood for.\nArfan Khan is an individual who commands great personal affection and respect in the community he serves as a funeral director.\nIs it a pragmatic, rather than a party vote\nThe Moslem community is currently trying to deal with issues at current burial sites and is keen to establish (a) new burial ground(s) in or near Peterborough and these campaigns will be more significant for many voters than any and all the goings on in Westminster.\nI can’t speak for or about Muhammad Asif, except to observe that, on the basis of his speech at the Park Ward hustings, he seems agreeable: mild and quietly spoken.\nWas Labour’s collapse more extreme in Park\nIn Park Ward, the resignation of the Labour Group Leader, ex Councillor Nawaz and the last minute resignation of ex Councillor Ikra Yasin prior to the elections will inevitably have damaged Labour’s chances in the ward, necessitating as they did, a last minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign. It is possible that the degree of Labour Party turbulence in Peterborough and especially in Park Ward is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Conventional wisdom would suggest that by this stage in the parliamentary electoral cycle, and with the current disgrace-inclined government, Labour should be able to wipe the board. Its supporters are angry that it isn’t taking opportunities when they are available. Labour could have taken control of Peterborough City Council, had it been allowed to work with other opposition councillors. As it is, Labour remains the hardest party to work with for the Greens (not just here), however helpful individual councillors might be.\nSo far, so good: these elements may be more or less peculiar to Park Ward. But I think most of the residents of the ward – and beyond – will still be bewildered that the Conservatives now hold two of the three city council seats representing residents in the ward. This is very clear in comments on Facebook.\nDefections to the Green Party\nBut the turmoil in Labour is worth returning to, since it has affected Peterborough’s Green election campaigns beyond Park Ward – and beyond Peterborough – too.\nPeterborough Greens (in common with Greens elsewhere in the country) have benefitted this year by the defections from Labour to our party of two excellent councillors. Bright Green published an article about this phenomenon. Unfortunately only one of ours (Cllr Heather Skibstead) succeeded in retaining her seat in Peterborough (which was Orton Longueville): she had more months and more of her own free time in which to communicate in advance of the election with her ward’s residents. However, her success represents a national first for the Green Party and we here as well as the party at large are delighted and very proud of this achievement.\nIt is really important for a political party to be able to manage post defection retention elections well. I’d like the Green Party to be a good place for good hard working conscientious councillors who’d much rather be with us, to defect to. Lots of councillors hang on in a political party they don’t really like, putting up with things they despise only because they know that being on your own and going independent is so risky. It makes sense that we work together to make it less risky to transfer a prior party allegiance to the Green Party. If you are reading this and are considering making such a step: please talk to us confidentially well in advance.\nWhen minus one equals plus one\nOddly, Heather’s retaining her seat counts as a GAIN for the Greens (even though as far as we were concerned, she was already a Green Party councillor), because the press compares the results of this with those of the previous election, which is guaranteed to confuse anyone not following things at this level of detail.\nThe second defector to our ranks this year was ex Cllr Imtiaz Ali. His arrival resulted in our biggest yet Green group of four on the council and I am sorry for him as well as for the group that he didn’t retain his Fletton & Woodston seat in this election. It would have been nearly if not impossible to win it, given the very short timescale available to his campaign.\nOnce again, despite losing Cllr Imtiaz Ali from our Green group on the council, Greens in Peterborough are reported in the media as having gained one councillor for the same confusing reasons. So despite gaining one, this picture on the council’s website on the day of the election, will soon reduce down to three councillors.\nBeyond all this excitement and a little further away in Orton Waterville, Councillor Nicola Day campaigned calmly and steadily to retain her seat and her campaign’s approach was rewarded with a huge margin of success, helping to entrench Orton Waterville’s reputation locally as an exceptionally well represented and very-happy-to-be-Green ward.\nThank you\nThis campaign has been truly extraordinary.\nThe achievement of Cllr Kirsty Knight in supporting members of another party getting used to Green ways of working cannot be overstated. This (as with many of her other roles) is not easy. Thank you Kirsty.\nIn this election our campaign teams have attempted more than ever before. Thank you for your votes. I have never received so many messages of support. I have never worked alongside so many volunteers and helpers. Our councillor team and our election team are quite simply, awesome. The reception candidates have received on doorsteps has been amazing and I feel that voters in Peterborough get us, at last. What we are, what we do, how we do it, and what we are capable of is just beginning to be understood. We are beginning to be seen, rather than described by outside hostile voices. The objectives we set ourselves are difficult and it is even more difficult to take people with us on these journeys, but I for one no longer feel I am on my own: there are people I have never met personally coming along beside me, who see me immediately they open their front door. I’d like to thank everyone who has appreciated us and lent us a hand during this campaign. We could not have achieved a fraction of what we have without such magnificent commitment and support. I hope you have enjoyed it and got something out of it as well. Thank you.\nreaders of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might explain the late declaration.\nThursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late.As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph. (Please note that the second and fourth articles have subsequently been updated.)\nThe third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am.\nWhy did huge Photo ID queues build up so late on election night?\nAs a candidate, my job on election night is to wait for the ballot box to come in and to be present at the count. This is how candidates respect the voter’s voice. The ballot box contains the ballots and on their ballot papers are the choices of voters, speaking and expressing their wishes on the one day they are allowed to vote. Candidates observe their counts. We see what they say.\nThe first of Park Ward’s ballot boxes (Madeley House polling station) came in in reasonable time. The second ballot box (All Saints polling station) came in very late indeed, apparently owing to a long queue building up due to the Photo ID check. Queue tickets were issued to those in the queue at 10pm. This was clearly not expected to be a big thing by polling staff, who, when I left them had already been on duty for thirteen and a half hours, with only on-site breaks. The third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am. I do not know how long polling staff had been at their posts by the time they were discharged from their duties, nor in what state they were. Polling staff are not permitted to leave the polling station while they are on duty and although they are all prepared for a 15 -16 hour shift, which is already an outrageously long working day, they certainly do not expect to be on duty very much beyond 10pm. I am wondering how many polling staff had to endure a 20 hour working day extending beyond Thursday 4th May into the early hours of the 5th.\nIt is true that PhotoID was trialled. But the very small trials were failures.\nUK government implemented the legislation despite the pilots’ failures.\nBallot boxes are normally handed over to the transport soon after 10pm and will usually arrive about an hour later. This year Peterborough City Council could not afford huge numbers of high security transit vehicles (the trucks looked like refrigerated container trucks) so some polling station staff at the eighty polling stations open at this year’s local election (there will be more polling stations for next year’s elections) will have had to wait for one of the five trucks waiting for a hold up somewhere else. I do not know how many polling stations were impacted by delays occurring in Park Ward. Nor do I know if other wards were themselves affected by late long queues.\nI cannot physically be in two places at once and all my team was already with me at the Town Hall. So, what I want to know is exactly what happened at the All Saints and St Georges polling stations. The advice I was given by polling staff was that the dinner time rush which usually starts between 5pm and 6pm was already dying down. Something clearly changed from the ward’s normal voting behaviour. How come? Why did such long queues form so late in the voting window?\nWere you in one of the queues? Please describe what happened.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements to cycling and walking routes.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.\nThis can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they will get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues .\nheld in Park Ward on 16th April\nSome people were disappointed at the turnout at yesterday’s candidate hustings at the Willow Cafe in Park Ward, but top community activists tell me that “the people who turn up to things are the right people”.\nI was making a cup of tea this morning and it dawned on me that there had been a disproportionately high number of sustainable transport professionals in the room. That speaks to ongoing safety and speeding issues in Park Ward and it tallies with despair on the doorstep that the well understood underlying problems persist unfixed. In fact if we rearranged the chairs in the room, we probably had the skills right there in the room to fix the problem. What these experts don’t have (as things stand) is the council’s ear. Once again, it is often the case that the solutions are not somewhere else: we’ve likely got them right here, in Park Ward.\nCandidates on the ballot paper turned up, with the exception of the Labour and Reform candidates.\nAttending in the audience, were just the right number of loud voices. True, many people didn’t say anything, but, for whatever reason, they decided not to speak.\nIt was not a scary event. There were no fights and I did not spot intimidation. However, I took one concern expressed to the host at face value and will catch up with this (and them) as and when I can.\nI have come across electoral malpractices including intimidation which is a known (but I believe increasingly historic) problem in Park Ward and it is one of the reasons why CCTV cameras are frequently installed outside some or all of Park’s polling stations. I am aware of various pressures which have been applied over the years to voters in Park Ward (they tell me about shocking things going on in the past). Most of these pressures are “normal” family, social or party influences and feelings of obligation, which are part of normal life and a functioning democracy. But once a person feels they are being bullied, losing their right to choose freely or even having their vote stolen, voters and candidates shouldn’t hesitate to call the police or Electoral Services at the council (who can work out what the problem might be and will liaise with the police if necessary).\nJohn Peach in the middle of the room does not (in my book) constitute intimidation: his body language and his Cheshire Cat grin said louder than words how much enjoyed the event (announced on the 5th), despite failing to invite his online newsletter readers (emailed on the 8th) across the ward to it. Probably a communication problem rather than a deliberate omission.\nThere was disappointment expressed by a couple of people at the event’s format, which was cabaret layout for the audience and mingling for candidates, designed to facilitate more personal encounters. The room has a lovely but hard floor so for the hard of hearing one speaker at a time would work, whereas two voices would blur each other out. There was a very good (but also very well resourced) accessible hustings held during Peterborough’s parliamentary by-election in 2019.\nIt is worth pointing out that the traditional format (high table at the top for the candidates and seats for the public arranged as if for a theatre show – like BBC Question Time) does allow for the person who wants to ask a question to take the floor and, if they want to, to command the room. This can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues . It also allows for a bit of tit for tat between candidates and lets them demonstrate (and develop and practice) any debating skills they have: very likely to come in handy if elected.\nThe event was recorded by an unknown individual at the back who didn’t ask permission or make himself known to the host. I have no idea if the recording will go anywhere: but I doubt it. Shout if you spot it.\nNobody took names of attendees or pictures. It was probably the least “posed” hustings I’ve attended and that makes a pleasant change.\nSo, in summary all good. Thank you Park Streets Ahead for the invitation. And well done, Beki Sellick for doing very well the incredibly tough job of chairing.\nI got a great deal out of attending and personally enjoyed it very much. I learned many things, including that when the awesome Rosemary was elected the youngest ever female councillor in Scotland, her campaign had focussed on housing and the position of wardrobes in bedroom layouts. Presumably at a time of massive council house building. I shall have to catch up with her again to find out more. Something else on the list for after the election.\nIf you live in Park Ward and your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nI am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again.Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.\nhe describes his grandfather’s decision to split with his brother and instead of returning home, to head to Peterborough.\nPeterborough before the motor car\nAn unforgettable neighbour spent part of her childhood living with relatives in and around “Bungate” an area to the east of present day East Ward, Peterborough. Her memories and stories would reduce me to tears of laughter as she brought the city she remembered to life.\nThen this morning, looking for something else entirely, I stumbled on an online book about Bungate. The author begins by describing his grandfather’s decision to split with his brother and instead of returning home, to head to Peterborough.\n“Thomas moved on in the opposite direction to try his luck in Peterborough, a small cathedral city, at the time and known throughout the Midlands as a town of “Pride, Poverty, Parsons and Pubs”.\nWhen Boongate was Bungate by T P Nutt\nThe book takes the reader back over a century in time and is a splendid, if rather shocking read for a rainy Easter holiday. You can read the book here.\nOn Thursday 4th May, Green Party councillors and candidates are standing for election and, some of them to retain their seats in a number of wards across Peterborough.\nI am honoured to have been selected to stand as Green Party candidate for Park Ward in Peterborough on Thursday 4th May.\nPeterborough Greens and Natalie Bennett gather in advance of Peterborough By ElectionRupert Read, Paul Jeater, Martin Schmierer, Jeremy Caddick, Catherine Rowett and Fiona RadicFiona Radic in Norwich on the St Julian Bridge in the city centreListening to Nicola Day as things get underway at a Park Ward hustings in 2018General Election Parliamentary Candidate, 2017Speaking out very strongly against the bombing of Gaza at a city centre rally in 2014Natalie Bennett and Rupert Read visit the Green Backyard in 2015Fiona Rupert & Ashley protesting fare hikesCampaigning in Ramsey for election to the European Parliament in 2014Peterborough Pensioners Hustings 2014In Priestgate, Peterborough, in 2013 with Peterborough Town Hall catching the sun.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_energy/content_587.html": "I happily accepted an invitation to join a “participating audience” tonight and gave away my ticket for the James Galway concert in Ely Cathedral.\nI turned up at the Copeland Community Centre to listen to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) challenge the solar voltaic project planned for Newborough and which has been vocally and enthusiastically led by Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative), Leader of Peterborough City Council (Conservative) who believes it presents the answer to what he (Conservative) describes as “the black hole” created by the ConDem (but mainly Conservative) government of which Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) is an elected representative. They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked. Something has to be very seriously wrong: when nobody\n- understands the process\n- bothers to explain it\n- knows what it is or\n- why it is there\nWhy does nobody ever challenge this preposterous pile of garbage? If someone fly-tipped vomit soaked nappies all over Cllr Nick Sandford (Liberal Democrat), would he actually mind? I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\n- lack of transparency (no figures available to the residents of Peterborough and – because I couldn’t ask my second question the audience was able to rest secure in the assumption – to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) himself.\n- treatment of farmers (I’ll expand for him here: the council’s first communication to 18 farmers was to warn them that they would be evicted if the plan went ahead)\n- risk of a change in the subsidy regime: no safety plan if the government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) changes the regime governing ROCs (again no discussion: no explanation)\n- no contingency fund if the sums are wrong\n- conflict with government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) policy on renewables (this was not explained at all)\n- has no plan B (if I may expand any decent proposal presents alternatives, preferably a well thought out range of options)\n- didn’t even know which brownfield sites it owned\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this. I think Peterborough should be enthusiastically refusing to reduce its tenanted farm land holdings.\nOnce Paul Stainton said they were starting to wind up and I still hadn’t succeeding in asking any of my questions I decided that since I wasn’t actually required as a speaking participant, as I had expected, I wasn’t going to be part of any awful preorganised tedious windbag wind up. So I left and expressed my feelings as clearly as I possibly could (being at that point absolutely livid) to David Murray, radio editor.\nSo what questions would I have asked? I had two: the first was in response to Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative). I wanted to ask him (and I’ll be honest I really wanted to ask this in front of a rolling TV camera):\n- Can you explain why you are not sure exactly how much income the solar voltaic array on the Freemans building is bringing in and why should anyone trust your figures if you are in the slightest bit uncertain on this point?\nAnd the other one was to Stewart Jackson. I wanted to ask him:\n- Whether or not public authorities (including Peterborough City Council) don’t have to disclose to our elected representative in parliament whatever information is requested of them and to confirm that he does actually have all the figures because he has asked the city council for them and they have been obliged to disclose them.\nPlease go to @PaulStainton or https://twitter.com/PaulStainton for more and use hashtag #solardebate\nPlease comment here if you don’t tweet or want more space",

Our local newspaper has already published this story but has not (so far) provided a list of who voted which way. I suppose this information will eventually be published in the council’s very own minutes, but who ever reads those?\nSo, since several people have asked for a breakdown, here are my gleanings from the Spectators Gallery:\nCON Arculus, Nick ABSTAIN West\nCON Casey, Graham ABSTAIN Orton Longueville\nCON Lee, Matthew ABSTAIN Fletton\nCON Maqbool, Yasmeen ABSTAIN West\nCON Simons, George ABSTAIN Paston\nCON Sanders, David name heard but unable to hear response Eye & Thorney\nCON Allen, Sue name not heard Orton Waterville\nCON Cereste Marco name not heard Stanground Central\nCON McKean, Dale name not heard Eye & Thorney\nCON Walsh, Irene name not heard Stanground Central\nCON Dalton, Matthew NOT VOTING West\nCON Day, Sue NOT VOTING Paston\nCON Elsey, Gavin NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Fitzgerald, Wayne NOT VOTING Bretton North\nCON Goodwin, Janet NOT VOTING Orton Longueville\nCON Harper, Chris NOT VOTING Stanground East\nCON Hiller, Peter NOT VOTING Northborough\nCON Holdich, John (OBE) NOT VOTING Ghinton & Wittering\nCON Kreling, Pam NOT VOTING Park\nCON Lamb, Diane NOT VOTING Glinton & Wittering\nCON Nadeem, Mohammed NOT VOTING Central\nCON Nawaz, Gul NOT VOTING Ravensthorpe\nCON North, Nigel NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Peach, John NOT VOTING Park\nCON Rush, Brian NOT VOTING Stanground Central\nCON Scott, Sheila NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Seaton, David NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Serluca, Lucia NOT VOTING Fletton\nCON Stokes, June NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Thacker, Paula NOT VOTING Werrington South\nCON Todd, Marion NOT VOTING East\nCON Over, David NOT VOTING Barnack\nLAB Forbes, Lisa FOR Orton Longueville\nLAB Jamil, Mohammed FOR Central\nLAB Johnson, Jo FOR East\nLAB Khan, Nazim (MBE) FOR Central\nLAB Knowles, John FOR Paston\nLAB Martin, Stuart FOR Bretton North\nLAB Shabbir, Nabil FOR East\nLAB Shearman, John FOR Park\nLAB Thulbourn, Nick FOR Fletton & Woodston\nLAB Murphy, Ed FOR Ravensthorpe\nLAB Sylvester, Ann FOR Bretton North\nLD Fower, Darren FOR Werrington South\nLD Sandford, Nick FOR Walton\nLD Shaheed, Asif FOR Walton\nLD Davidson, Julia name heard but unable to hear response Werrington South\nPIF Miners, Adrian declared interest, so unable to vote Dogsthorpe\nPIF Ash, Christopher FOR Dogsthorpe PIF Fletcher, Michael FOR Bretton South\nPIF Fox, John FOR Werrington North\nPIF Fox, Judith FOR Werrington North\nPIF Harrington, David FOR Newborough\nPIF Saltmarsh, Christabel FOR Dogsthorpe\nPIF Sharp, Keith FOR North\nPIF Swift, Charles (OBE) FOR “but confused” North\nPIF Lane, Stephen name not heard Werrington North\nI found it very difficult indeed to pick up the voices of the Conservative councillors last night. It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.\nThis is what it looked like to another observer: http://parkfarmneighbourhoodwatch.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/childrens-centres-first-for.html\nHere is a photo of the opposition standing up to demand a recorded vote: http://terry-harris.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Full-Council-Childrens-Centre-Closures/G0000xzhmtuMp.a4/I0000UNVajRUjfiU\nBut the big question now is will Cabinet pay any attention at all to the wishes of Council when it meets on Monday at 10am?\nThanks Fiona, good work.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_01_05_henry-penn-walk-collapse-update/content_291.html": "Neglect of City Centre River Walk on North Embankment of River Nene\nPhotos of the sorry state of collapsed Henry Penn Walk have been posted on Facebook by We Love Peterborough.\nI documented the state of the path in August 2021. You can compare WLP’s recent photo here with mine:\nBut the problem pre dated my first blog on the subject by a long way. There is a closed report on the council’s website, dated 20th October 2020.\nSince I wrote that blog, I’ve been told that the reason nothing has been done to repair the broken path is that Peterborough City Council, (possibly Environment Agency) and one or more developers can’t agree on who owns the path and also that it was built out over the river without planning or any other kind of permission (I’m not sure what the procedure is for building out into a river). As ever I’m happy to be corrected if I have been misinformed this latter point. A slightly different story appeared almost a year ago, when a swift end to the legal tangle, (but apparently not involving the EA) was expected. It suggests that the council agrees it owns the surface of the path. But not its foundations. (Could that happen and if so, how could it have arisen?)\nA legal battle may make it awkward for the parties to it to speak to the press. But two of those parties are funded by the tax payer and the tax payer should be told why a solution and suitable repair could not precede settlement of the case. The costs could be recouped – if necessary – by means of a legal charge on the property. If the path is a property which was built by means of illegal invasion of the river, which seems a bit unlikely, what is the remedy in law? Does an illegal property exist or is it a bit like Schrödinger’s cat? Can a property which should not even be there be compulsorily purchased or confiscated? Can it even have an owner? Could a proper repair cost more than the value of a shoddy property (I’d bet it could). I think we should be told.\nMost unfortunately the council has set an awful precedent in Park Ward, where a drain it was given by Peterborough Development Corporation was built out into by a neighbouring property owner and a hideous building was given retrospective planning permission. So the council has established a flabby attitude to allowing people to develop beyond their own boundaries and into its watery properties (not something I condone or recommend).\nBut even if the story I was told holds water, it should be possible to find out who built a path on the bank capable of being washed away. While the flats were under construction, the whole site was fenced off, so the general public would not have been able to see anything. Is the organisation which built a soluble embankment still in business?\nIt should be possible to establish the position of the river bank before and after the flats were built. It should be possible to find out how many building regulations checks were performed as the flats were built and whether or not the rogue path was spotted or anything done about it during the flats’ construction. This is something the council’s planning department should be able to establish. I don’t have photographs. But someone must have some.\nI’ve been assured that no danger is posed to the buildings, but even if this is true, it is not the impression given by the landscaping: the dodgy path appears to have been held up by a steel retaining wall which has very definitely failed. It isn’t clear to the casual passer by (even if it is to the council’s structural engineering expert) what is holding the flats up. If the council’s building inspectors missed a dodgy retaining wall, can we be sure that they checked the one which may or may not be behind the dodgy one and which may or not be holding the embankment under the flats in place?\nThe path poses obvious hazards to pedestrians and cyclists and has, rightly, been closed. However repairs to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, even in Central Ward in Peterborough does not carry the priority it would if the route happened to carry cars. This despite the fact that the path is on the tourist trail. Peterborough remains a car crazy city and unattractive damage to the north bank river path persists apparently unnoticed by the city’s elected members. Voters should note that Cllr Jamil’s current term of office ends in May.\n<\ndiv dir=”ltr”>This is something th\nLikeLike\nHi June I don’t understand your comment.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2025_03_11_abandon-dualling-and-slow-traffic-to-improve-safety-and-flow/content_131.html": "Our local paper highlights delays.\nThe appalling project: to dual the A47 between the Wansford roundabout and the Sutton roundabout should be abandoned, especially the section near Wansford, where residents have been led to believe that duelling will prevent queueing in and out of their village during rush hours. This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\n- to accept that there is an unavoidable pinch point at this location\n- to properly repair and maintain the existing road\n- and to put in permanent graduated speed controls which has been proven to improve both flow and safety.\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess. It would be ridiculous, if it weren’t also dangerous.",

Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nFirstly, Peterborough is BIGGER than Cambridge.\nI occasionally make just this point and people look at me as if I was mad. But yes it has been for a while and it still is. I’ve just double checked last census data available on Wikipedia:\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarked gets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn order to make something perfectly clear to your colleagues in a democratic forum it is a legal requirement to declare your interests. It is a criminal offence not to, if it happens to be a pecuniary interest. For some obscure reason, this requirement appears not to have been applied (at least by means of a publicly accessible document) by our Local Enterprise Partnership, until the MP complained. The Register is now available online and forms part of a section on Corporate Governance.\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nMeanwhile I’d love to know what you think.\nAnd if you happen to live in Chatteris or in Wisbech, I hope you vote for Julie too!",

The orange object on the path should have been binned by the dog’s owner. This is a new problem in Central Park. The park warden used to talk to people and hand out bags. A loose branch hangs high above the flag in the middle of the park. The flag pole needs a little repair too. This rootball must have sounded like cannon being fired when it snapped. Glorious brilliance in the sheared surfaces. Almost gold. Late afternoon in shade. Elsewhere the sun is on it. I wish I could have captured the astonishment in his face as he cycled up to this! When I approached this tree some teenagers were jumping on it. They saw me, looked very sheepish and ran away. They don’t make teenagers like they used to, do they? Twisted and snapped. Sheared. Bright orange surfaces of broken wood. Peter watches Bonnie investigate. The dog was very energetic: the result of having to kept in yesterday. Odd how little the surrounding grass has been disturbed. You’d expect the roots to be all over the place, but no: all broken off, quite neatly.

This visit formed one of a number of visits to the region’s growing number of food banks by members of the European Green Team in the run up to the European elections on 22nd May. Our team has reported on Hunger in the East.\nThe Ramsey foodbank is based at St Thomas a Becket on Ramsey High Street and it works as part of the network of Trussell Trust foodbanks which now serve no fewer than fourteen communities throughout Cambridgeshire.\n“I arrived with me lots of grand ideas and optimism. Less than a week before my visit I had been at the opening of a new food cooperative in Peterborough which has huge ambitions to change the way we shop and eat in the city. I am talking to growers and makers and I am often around people who jar and pot things.\n“When I arrived in Ramsey the market town sitting in an area of rich arable land was particularly green and beautiful, and lush with recent rain. The harsh realities of hunger in an area which is so very rich agriculturally brought me down to earth and made me think.”\nWHY EMPTY KITCHEN CUPBOARDS IN RAMSEY?\nRev’d Gita Bond, who manages the Ramsey project explained that “The foodbank provides an emergency food supply for people without an income or on an income so low that they cannot afford food. Its clientele is identified by one of a dozen different agencies as in need of emergency food. They are issued with a voucher.”\nThe food bank relies on ongoing donations from parishioners and residents and it is also on the lookout for people who can deliver donations to people who are not mobile or who live further away.\nGita didn’t need to explain about the tea and biscuit which awaits volunteers: a group of people were talking and organising all manner of things around a busy and welcoming table. The church works with a wide range of community groups and there is a warm welcome for everybody.\nFoodbanks have proliferated because successive governments have failed and failed and failed again to tackle poverty wages.\nThe costs of living rise and people in work find their pay stands still and it is impossible to pay all the bills and put food on the table. People earning poverty pay are a growing part of those turning to food banks for help.\nPeople not in work for various reasons are more obviously vulnerable to hunger. But they are also victims of ideologically motivated and regressive government decisions.\nThe Green Party disapproves very strongly of the Department of Work and Pensions’ “sanctions” regime, which literally removes the welfare safety net from vulnerable claimants. Although a sanction can later be removed, a hunger gap opens up immediately. If the person falling into that hunger gap is lucky, they might get help from the foodbank.\n“Worries have recently been expressed to me that employees in the DWP may be being prevented by their line managers from identifying and referring people who need food immediately.”\n“We need an immediate change in government policy. Policy has gone back to before the second world war: we had malnutrition then and it is shameful that it has come back.\n“And on the ground, regardless of who gets elected on 22nd May, we need to figure out how we can improve our food resilience.\n“I was both impressed and horrified. I could see that almost all the food in the store is processed and packaged and it needs to be like that in order to have a reasonably long shelf life. Consequently there is nothing fresh at all. If someone donates something with a source of protein in it, such as a tin of fish or meatballs it can be issued. But if what is received is nutritionally unbalanced or poor, or all if all the donations are pasta, then that is all the foodbank can issue.\n“I suspect that what happens is that someone steps in: I bet it is someone with very limited means themselves, but it will be someone who cares. Communities work like this: but it is awful that they have to. But I am so very impressed with what they do manage to achieve despite the problems.\n“What I simply don’t understand is why we accept this system. Isn’t it insane for a country as wealthy as ours to function in this miserable way?\nCALL TO RETAIL CHAINS TO HELP\nThe Green Party is urging retail chains with outlets in the Ramsey area to make small regular donations of suitable items. A list is available from the foodbank.\n“But beyond these immediate calls for help, we are urging food processors to identify and minimise food waste. I sometimes hear about large amounts of perfectly edible food being dumped in Cambridgeshire: some of it destined for landfill (because it has been packaged and it is not worth unpacking it). Some of it goes for composting. In fact I heard a little while ago that on a farm close to Ramsey supermarket reject tomatoes were being composted. They might be the wrong colour or shape. This is not sustainable: this is not right.\n“It is high time we got this edible fresh food quickly to people who want and need good quality local food. I am perfectly happy to go and talk to a producer or a shop myself about what goes wrong in our broken food systems and how we can work to tackle hunger.

Smoke and smog affect visitors’ perceptions of the city as they step onto the platform and air quality has a serious and ongoing impact on residents’ health and wellbeing. Many people living in the city have actually forgotten what fresh air smells like: they are no longer aware they are living in smoggy conditions: they simply don’t smell the smoke any more. These fires (many of them illegal) are set in the evening, just as council officers go home and since they are usually “safe” (i.e. someone is supervising the fire and it isn’t getting out of control) the fire brigade is not required to take action.\nCouncil decided to approve, construct and launch (2016) its very own landfill waste incinerator with Cllr Kreling (on the planning committee at the time of approval) observing that if she couldn’t see anything coming out of the stack (the planning committee was taken on a tour of a similar monster), nothing was coming out. The council has never agreed to and is not live streaming data about its emissions from the stack.\nPeterborough Renewable Energy Limited who were the first to propose an incinerator for the city did agree to live stream their emissions data on their website. But this is not the incinerator which has gone live.\nThe Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor for East Ward, the ward with both planned incinerators sitting in it, offered to throw Richard Olive and me out of the council chamber She couldn’t throw us out because she couldn’t find a bailiff. But she was perfectly able to make a lousy decision without listening to evidence. For me, this was my introduction to the realities of politics in Peterborough. Most people have a vague sense of trust in their elected representatives. I lost whatever tiny bit I had left that day.\nBetween then and now council decided to knock down and pulverise numbers of large buildings made of brick, cement and plaster (Thomas Deacon School and several other predecessor-to-PFI schools, Bridge House, Peterborough District Hospital & assorted buildings on site). No dust suppression in place during the works and no coverage of the remaining mountains of dust (I observed the 20 ft high mountain of grey dust next to Aldermans Drive yesterday: 14th March 2016).\nThe Junction of Taverners Road with Bourges Boulevard is close to and downwind of the pile of pulverised sky scraper hospital and is also in a high density residential area. This junction is now close to breaching traffic pollution limits and that is according to official monitors. Are we surprised? Hardly. Cough Cough.\nIn London it has been shown that official monitoring is significantly understating the true state of affairs: http://cleanair.london/?s=monitorin…\nPeople feel there is nothing they can do. But there are a few things.\nMore people need to observe democracy in action, even if it does mean risking getting thrown out of meetings. The dishonour of getting thrown out is not yours.\nWe could choose not to reelect councillors who fail to help improve air quality and who drive themselves around in heavy overpowered diesel vehicles.\nWe could vote in councillors who don’t drive. Or who drive electric, hybrid and low emissions vehicles. The importance of leadership cannot be overstated.\nWe could vote in councillors who understand that a 20mph speed limit in Peterborough’s residential streets would make cycling and walking pleasanter and would reduce the number of journeys taken by car.\nWe could find a real time air pollution app which relies on independent air monitoring and which works in Peterborough, so that we are not obliged to rely solely on council owned data.\nThe council could live stream its incinerator emissions and on street air pollution monitoring data on its website. If it is proud of what it is doing, there should be no qualms in showing off its achievements.\n10am to 8pm – Monday 7th March to Saturday 12th March\nAdmission free to all events\nCome and find out how to use less energy, save money, live more sustainably and help to improve your environment.\nThe show combines an exhibition and evening events looking at energy saving measures and renewable technologies.

This is a rare thing in Peterborough: a ward hustings. As far as I am aware Park Ward is the only ward in the unitary authority of Peterborough which holds a regular hustings events. Here, voters are invited, either by the residents’ associations or by whoever leaflets the ward. Park Ward has begun to view them as an important part of the run up to election day. I am a big fan of hustings, as a glimpse at my blog will confirm. I’d like to see several in every ward, since they give people chances to thrash out where candidates stand on different issues, and how they perform, and what they are like.\nAnyway every candidate appearing on the ballot paper in May had been invited to the Church Hall by a local residents’ association and the turnout was small, but respectable and well informed. John Peach, CON, was the last candidate to arrive. I would probably have been taking my seat and organising bits of paper when there was the very slightest flutter of excitement in the audience. The hustings proceeded without incident.\nOne of the most true and telling observations of the 2015 election campaign was made by a man at the back of the audience. He pointed out that climate change had disappeared from all the parties’ election campaigns.\nAfter the event someone else came up to me and asked me to accompany him into the car park to see how John Peach had parked his car. He claimed to have felt an impact, but I am pretty sure his tongue was in his cheek and I have to say the wall did not move for me. But naturally I had a look. And of course I took a photo.\nI couldn’t see the wall behind the rear bumper at all. Can you?\nI realised that had there been the sort of penetrative event you see in a crazy American road movie, instead of talking to a man in a car park, I might have seen a man flying across my field of vision and just for a second I imagined him fly, hanging on to his church hall chair as a massive black car skidded across the parquet floor in a hail of bricks and plaster dust. But that was just me imagining something which certainly did not happen that evening. Thank goodness.\nWhat I did observe is that Cllr John Peach, (who was reelected and has since been crowned Mayor of our fair city) had proved himself capable of parking his car next to a wall in such a way that there is not a single millimetre between the car and the bricks. Not a single one.\nI blog this now only because the antique Jaguar, the mayoral vehicle EG1 is reportedly:\nand I for one would like to know how #PossibleRightOff happened.\nAnd what it costs to keep this particular mayor in maintenance and insurance.\nPerhaps Conservative councillors could tell the voters exactly what they each spend on driving around the city in very fancy cars, and how much of that expense is funded by residents?\nSaturday 16th January 2016 11am – 3pm at Riverside Pavilion, Candy Street, Peterborough, PE2 9RE\nAn Open Space discussion on how to create a green and sustainable Peterborough is being hosted by Peterborough Green Party. Tickets are free, but places are limited!\nThe event offers attendees a chance to share their views openly on a number of topics, which will be chosen by participants at the event. We hope to pursue the theme of a sustainable and green city and our objective is to facilitate and engage in ongoing dialogue with the City Council.\nI attended a workshop hosted by Civic Voice and as a result have joined a Peterborough “Asset of Community Value” group founded at the workshop. The workshop explained how an “asset of community value” can be registered with the local council and what that means should it be or become threatened. The rules were explained and what and what was not eligible.\nThe new group is not a “political” group in that peoples’ views on the legislation may be strong, but those views are not the point. I would describe this as a “technical” alliance between people prepared to share knowledge and help people in Peterborough who want to do this. I was quite shocked to learn that Peterborough has only registered two Assets of Community Value (the Green Backyard and the Football Ground) whereas Chelmsford identified seventy which needed to be registered.\nWhat about the Lido? We need a little list.\nCllr Andy Coles acted as spokesperson for the Peterborough group at the workshop and he was an obvious elected councillor lead. For those who don’t know him he is a keen supporter of The Green Backyard and used to be its beekeeper. He has also supported the parishing of Westwood (a project currently in abeyance, but which I strongly support) and he currently holds the council’s “community” brief.\nAlun Williams volunteered to look after the membership.\nAs part of my fundraising for Going to Mongolia I am hosting two events. The first is on the 4th of July at 19:30 and is a Piano Recital with Irena Radić who is currently studying at the Royal College of Music. Irena has won several awards: Peterborough Young Musician of the Year 2013; the Jaques Samuel Competition; Oundle young musician of the Year 2013; and the Teresa Carreno award. The program will include fun and exciting music by composers such as Bach Beethoven Debussy Faure and Scriabin. The concert venue is the St. John’s Church Cathedral Square, Peterborough and admission is free!\nYou can book at the following website or go by the short link:",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2018_05_16_3227/content_336.html": "Waste activism in Peterborough has a long and distinguished history and a great many people and many organised groups have got stuck in, many of them heroically and steadily cleaning up things which simply shouldn’t be where they are.\nThis blog years ago as a lament that I had not been able to achieve something I’d dedicated a great deal of time and energy to: stopping the construction of a plant to incinerate domestic waste. And in this blog I began to look at and discuss the politics of Peterborough generally, partly in order to understand and explain the weaknesses of campaigning organisations in the city (who I then felt could all have done better) against a political decision to incinerate, based on levels of (elected councillor) ignorance which I’d never encountered before in any organisation. I needed to understand how that had happened too, and who benefits from a toxic waste disposal policy. Who benefits from a waste policy which isn’t working.\nMeanwhile it seems that the attitudes I encountered: literally: “if you can’t see it, there is nothing there” approach to stack emissions has created a national problem, especially in England, which now does things worse and to lower standards than Scotland, Wales, the USA and Europe. Brexit might offer hope to those that are keen to practice toxic politics, but the toxins left in our environment aren’t going anywhere.\nBut about three years ago the Green Party began a Flash Mob Litter Pick, which roved around in response to resident callouts to deal with litter hotspots. Here’s a Flash Mob after a session litter picking in 2016, taken in a New England cul de sac: Like any litter picker, we were dealing with the council and its ways of doing things, with the odd hazardous item (discarded hypodermic needles are one of the worst at the moment) and we were also thinking about things like the bags the council uses, why people do what they do, where it comes from and how it travelled to where it is. We had hundreds of conversations, with each other, with passers by, with the council and with the people who deal with fly tipped toxic wastes (such as paints, oils, chemicals). It didn’t take us long to appreciate that people were sometimes being turned away by the legal disposal routes because of the way they had been implemented by the council or because of the conversations they had had with council operatives. We encountered a number of people who had been turned away from the Household Waste centre at Dogsthorpe. We realised that if you make people feel they are doing something wrong when they thought they were doing something right (they just didn’t know about the law or the procedure for doing what the council requires them to do) you are probably just building anti-council feelings and even another fly tip. The council operative is probably doing the right thing: saying all the right things, but the person to whom they are talking is struggling to cope with the situation. Some people get angry. Some people are shocked. In this situation, people may hear what is said to them, but they won’t be able to listen. So as we picked, we worked out that if one cul de sac could produce two car boot fulls of waste and a pile of fly tip, then there would be several skips full in each ward in the city. The volume of discarded waste lying around in our environment, defining our environment for everyone living or growing up in it – are unbelievable.\nWith fly tip, we looked at it and we began to understand the impact of the nice man at the front door who offers to take away your rubbish despite not having obtained the all important waste carrier’s licence. The role of this character is key: he (we think it is usually a he!) has perfectly understood the business opportunity provided to him by this corporate communications disaster.\nSometimes it is a whole house contents which is tipped out onto the highway, or someone else’s private property. Anybody in Peterborough can see that there is a big problem with landlords, or with people providing services to landlords and tenants. People living in or running the rental sector grab the cheapest furniture, because tenures are short and incomes are tight and what could be a re-use opportunity is instead a dumped problem. Legitimate house clearance businesses: where are they?\nJulie Howell (pictured here in New England) took the conclusions to Orton Waterville where she was a parish councillor and she applied herself to communicating directly with every resident. Waste management was just one of the things she tackled in her communications. Here she discusses fly tipping on her blog:\nhttp://howell4ortonwaterville.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/getting-grip-on-fly-tipping.html\nAnd here she is discussing fly tip on Radio Cambridgeshire yesterday morning:\nYesterday she was responding to the council leader who made some interesting comments in an article published in the Peterborough Telegraph soon after Julie was elected to the city councillor and thereby displaced the cabinet member responsible for waste management. The paper’s headline and the photograph put fly tipping into the spotlight.\nFirst he announces that fly-tipping will be “a focus” for the council this coming year. And admits that the issue was “repeatedly raised on the doorsteps in the run-up to the elections.” This might suggest that there is hope.\nBut then he says something really interesting. What he appears to do in a scant four lines of text, is give a summary of the results of the Free Bulky Waste Trial. I don’t know if a detailed analysis of the results of the trial has been made available to elected councillors or whether or not that analysis breaks down at ward level. But if not that is what I’d be asking for if I was a councillor.\nHoldich claims that the trial “made no difference to the amount of fly-tipping,” This suggests that the council has a way of very accurately measuring fly tipping activity over a period of time. That would be very interesting, if it were true. I think the police might be interested in how the council knows this too, since not being able to catch fly tippers is one of its defining and most annoying characteristics.\nThen he asserts that “the council missed out on £40,000 from fewer paid collections.” Now, assuming he’s right about that, it suggests to me that the people making use of the free trial were people who would otherwise have called the council to arrange a paid for collection. This group of people, complying with existing procedures and forking out for the collections they organise does not strike me as an appropriate target group if you wanted to attract the waste which is being fly tipped and the people doing the fly tipping, because this group is by Holdich’s definition not fly-tipping their waste anyway. They are doing it correctly and dutifully providing the council with additional revenue.\nThen Holdich claims that “It’s a national problem and nobody has come up with a panacea.” I think by calling on a Greek goddess, he is both looking for and deriding a universal fix. He might do better if he looked systematically at another goddess: Hygeia is the Greek goddess of cleanliness and hygiene, a goddess understood by the Greeks to be part of Aesclepius’ family of medicine, health and feeling good generally.\nBut let’s have a closer look at the council’s “Free Bulky Waste Trial”. It was designed to run for thirteen weeks: from 11th December to 9th March. A bulky waste collection normally costs £23.50. So adding up the available collections during the free trial, we have a cap of 52 collections per day, and an estimated “more than 1,000 free collections” during month one. Then a maximum of 26 per day for the remainder of the trial. Residents would be free to book a collection between 4th December to 5th March. So what actually happened?\nWe don’t know, except that the available slots were taken up enthusiastically to the extent that no more bookings for free collections were taken from 25th January, six weeks before the trial was supposed to end. Taking Christmas into account, the Trial stopped half way through. In fact it didn’t survive the Spring Clean Season. When the council closed new advance bookings, it was clear already that it was well organised people who were using the trial.\nWhat we do know is that if £40,000 revenue was lost to the council because people using the trial would otherwise have booked a chargeable collection, then 1702 free collections were made who’d otherwise pay for those collections. These will have been well organised people complying with procedures, who probably were unlikely to be fly tipping waste or giving it to to a fly tipper masquerading as a legitimate waste handler before the trial began.\nThe big question, then, is how many collections were made above 1702.\n52 per day for the first month would give us four weeks one of which includes the Christmas break. So let’s say 52 x 4 x 3 = 624\nThen we have 26 per day for the other nine weeks, so x 4 x 9 = 936\nIf we add these figures together and take them away from 1702, we get 142.\nRoughly one hundred and forty two collections were available to people who maybe would NOT normally have called the council. And that figure can only be true if the council and those people were able to use every single slot it had available. Given that this target group is likely to be less well organised, less well resourced and generally less compliant with how the council runs things, I find this highly unlikely.\nWe don’t know if the council added capacity, as it promised it would at the outset of the trial if demand was high. And if it didn’t, we don’t know why it didn’t. It may have realised that the non fly tipping community was not engaging very much with its trial, and if so, that would not surprise me.\nI am sure that Holdich feels that the trial proves his point. I dare say it proves mine too: that the systems in place are unfit for purpose for many sections of our community and it is also clear that the ruling Conservatives still have no sensible plan in place to change that.",

(I deplore the use of a word like “aggressive” to stereotype a wide community which cycles on pavements.)\nBut here we go again, this time with a word which suggests one superior tribe (maybe driving Chelsea tractors?) looking down on another primitive and uncivilised group (maybe all these things because they can’t afford a Chelsea tractor?).\nGiven that bicycles can’t really eat one another, I assume the police peep believes that the cyclists are stealing each others’ bicycles? I’m really not sure how such a useless assertion will help the police catch thieves. What I can tell the police is that this use of language is calculated to annoy cyclists with even the smallest bit of linguistic and political sensitivity. Like me.\nI wonder when Peterborough’s leading political and police peeps will make it into the twentieth century and or cycling enlightenment?\nOne thought on “Are Peterborough cyclists cannibals now?”",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_author_fionaradic_page_4/content_721.html": "If you live in Park Ward and your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nI am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again. Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.",

To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to.

Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nFirstly, Peterborough is BIGGER than Cambridge.\nI occasionally make just this point and people look at me as if I was mad. But yes it has been for a while and it still is. I’ve just double checked last census data available on Wikipedia:\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarked gets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn order to make something perfectly clear to your colleagues in a democratic forum it is a legal requirement to declare your interests. It is a criminal offence not to, if it happens to be a pecuniary interest. For some obscure reason, this requirement appears not to have been applied (at least by means of a publicly accessible document) by our Local Enterprise Partnership, until the MP complained. The Register is now available online and forms part of a section on Corporate Governance.\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nMeanwhile I’d love to know what you think.\nAnd if you happen to live in Chatteris or in Wisbech, I hope you vote for Julie too!",

Do you have enough information to have an opinion on where new unitary authority boundaries should lie? Do you know of a Peterborough event where this reorganisation will be considered?\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding Yaxley (Huntingdonshire District Council) and Whittlesey (Fenland District Council) residents from using their nearest (surely?) but “our” Household Recycling Facility!\nThe Nene is in flood, still transporting last summer and autumn’s above average rainfall to the Wash and new steadily heavy El Niño winter rain. Since my third update the Conservative administration at Peterborough City Council has been toppled and a well intentioned but inexperienced ex opposition multi party Cabinet is trying to keep the council’s finances afloat and to fix whatever has been going wrong. The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements to cycling and walking routes.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.\nThis can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they will get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues .\nheld in Park Ward on 16th April\nSome people were disappointed at the turnout at yesterday’s candidate hustings at the Willow Cafe in Park Ward, but top community activists tell me that “the people who turn up to things are the right people”.\nI was making a cup of tea this morning and it dawned on me that there had been a disproportionately high number of sustainable transport professionals in the room. That speaks to ongoing safety and speeding issues in Park Ward and it tallies with despair on the doorstep that the well understood underlying problems persist unfixed. In fact if we rearranged the chairs in the room, we probably had the skills right there in the room to fix the problem. What these experts don’t have (as things stand) is the council’s ear. Once again, it is often the case that the solutions are not somewhere else: we’ve likely got them right here, in Park Ward.\nCandidates on the ballot paper turned up, with the exception of the Labour and Reform candidates.\nAttending in the audience, were just the right number of loud voices. True, many people didn’t say anything, but, for whatever reason, they decided not to speak.\nIt was not a scary event. There were no fights and I did not spot intimidation. However, I took one concern expressed to the host at face value and will catch up with this (and them) as and when I can.\nI have come across electoral malpractices including intimidation which is a known (but I believe increasingly historic) problem in Park Ward and it is one of the reasons why CCTV cameras are frequently installed outside some or all of Park’s polling stations. I am aware of various pressures which have been applied over the years to voters in Park Ward (they tell me about shocking things going on in the past). Most of these pressures are “normal” family, social or party influences and feelings of obligation, which are part of normal life and a functioning democracy. But once a person feels they are being bullied, losing their right to choose freely or even having their vote stolen, voters and candidates shouldn’t hesitate to call the police or Electoral Services at the council (who can work out what the problem might be and will liaise with the police if necessary).\nJohn Peach in the middle of the room does not (in my book) constitute intimidation: his body language and his Cheshire Cat grin said louder than words how much enjoyed the event (announced on the 5th), despite failing to invite his online newsletter readers (emailed on the 8th) across the ward to it. Probably a communication problem rather than a deliberate omission.\nThere was disappointment expressed by a couple of people at the event’s format, which was cabaret layout for the audience and mingling for candidates, designed to facilitate more personal encounters. The room has a lovely but hard floor so for the hard of hearing one speaker at a time would work, whereas two voices would blur each other out. There was a very good (but also very well resourced) accessible hustings held during Peterborough’s parliamentary by-election in 2019.\nIt is worth pointing out that the traditional format (high table at the top for the candidates and seats for the public arranged as if for a theatre show – like BBC Question Time) does allow for the person who wants to ask a question to take the floor and, if they want to, to command the room. This can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues . It also allows for a bit of tit for tat between candidates and lets them demonstrate (and develop and practice) any debating skills they have: very likely to come in handy if elected.\nThe event was recorded by an unknown individual at the back who didn’t ask permission or make himself known to the host. I have no idea if the recording will go anywhere: but I doubt it. Shout if you spot it.\nNobody took names of attendees or pictures. It was probably the least “posed” hustings I’ve attended and that makes a pleasant change.\nSo, in summary all good. Thank you Park Streets Ahead for the invitation. And well done, Beki Sellick for doing very well the incredibly tough job of chairing.\nI got a great deal out of attending and personally enjoyed it very much. I learned many things, including that when the awesome Rosemary was elected the youngest ever female councillor in Scotland, her campaign had focussed on housing and the position of wardrobes in bedroom layouts. Presumably at a time of massive council house building. I shall have to catch up with her again to find out more. Something else on the list for after the election.\nNearby roads seem to be named after people. I hunted for any reference to a stone quarry: they are clearly some of the city’s older roads. Instead I found pictures of the mill which (I believe) gave Millfield its name. Mills have (and use up) millstones.\nGo to Peterborough Images (and browse this awesome resource) to view pictures of this area at the beginning of the twentieth century. This picture doesn’t answer my question. Do comment if you can.\nThe tram in the picture would have been tucked up at night in what is now the bus station on Lincoln Road. The rails ran out of there and radiated all over Peterborough. https://www.peterboroughimages.co.uk/millfield-c-1909/\nThe images of old Millfield are copyright, so I can’t upload them to my website.\nAnother fascinating detail in this picture is that the street tree has been planted in the gutter, rather than on the pavement. Watering the tree was presumably considered a sensible part of the storm drainage system.\nI don’t know why or when street trees were moved up onto pavements. Maybe to protect them from vehicular impacts? After all:\nCompetency tests were introduced by the Motor Vehicles Regulations 1935 applicable to all drivers who started driving after 1 April 1934. Competency tests were suspended in 1939 for seven years due to the Second World War and in 1956 for one year due to the Suez Crisis. The only person in the United Kingdom who is not required to have a driving licence in order to drive is the King.[24][25]\nWhy did relevant authorities (with information about the landfill) fail to identify or withhold the most probable cause of a child’s death?\nInto how toxic landfill met floodwater, releasing hydrogen cyanide into a home\nWhy relevant authorities (with information about the landfill) failed to identify or withhold the most probable cause of a child’s death\nHere are some questions which I personally would like to see answered:\nHow did not knowing about the landfill impact:\nthe pathologist who examined the boy’s body\nthe poisoned boy’s immediate family (one of whom survived, but was permanently paralysed)\nthe medical staff who treated the family\nemergency services personnel\nflood remediation workers\nand the wider connections and community surrounding the boy’s family, including his school.\nWhat happens when authorities fail the people relying on them?\nDid what happened (or didn’t happen) constitute negligence?\nAnd, if it did, what are the impacts of people failing to do the jobs they are paid to do properly on wider society and on people, paid or volunteering, trained and willing to do the right thing?\nDo members of our society need to be able to trust the mechanisms and organisations which constitute government?\nWhen something which should not fail does fail, why?\nDo government organisations have what they need to do their jobs?\nHow can we know how many times what went wrong in this case has also gone wrong previously and elsewhere?\nHow are government organisations accountable to us?\nAt what point does negligence become corporate manslaughter?\nAt what point do successive failures become systemic, permitted or intentional failure?

They’ve got through to the council and have been told the council is now going after “GKL”. I thought I’d established that they built the building and, presumably the embankment which has subsequently collapsed. The journalist were now being told that this entity is the property manager (which took me completely by surprise). So, RHRL is out of the picture, just for the moment. Which is interesting because as of a couple of days ago, the council’s press office were saying they were going after/in dispute/had settled with RHRL. Weren’t they? Isn’t it the name in the local paper, linked in my second update? Now why would the council’s press office have been saying that if it wasn’t true? Please note that my first assumption is absolutely not that the press office has “made a genuine error” (as claimed by Cllr Fitzgerald over the entirely unrelated cheque gate affair. But that is a whole other scandal.)\nCould this mean that the council is now chasing after a relevant, genuinely responsible entity and that maybe flat owners will not be held liable for the repairs? If so, there is hope.\nNew morning. New search. Google search immediately produces possibly irrelevant\nand, likely more relevant, GKL BUILDING & CIVIL ENGINEERING LTD\nTwo directors with significant influence or control.\nMr James Andrew BrackenburyACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthAugust 1977NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlHas significant influence or control\nWho has a B Eng in Civil Engineering from Nottingham Trent.\nand\nMr Eamonn Michael KillougheryACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthMay 1962NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlOwnership of shares – 75% or moreOwnership of voting rights – 75% or moreRight to appoint and remove directors\nand 28 other companies. Including GKL DEVELOPMENTS (UK) LTD, Company number 05599784. So what we have is a large multi sector group of companies, with activities including waste disposal, road construction, property development and management.\nThe story that the developer went broke looks unconvincing, at first glance, anyway. And anyway, thinking about it, where did that story come from? And why am I aerated about the issue? Oh yes, of course: Facebook.\nI’m not sure why Cllr Fitzgerald is still blocking me. Maybe he’s still cross about the starring role he played in my top post of all time?\nSo there we were about midday Friday 20th January. I came back to finish this early this morning.\nSince my first update on the collapse, the press got excited and phone calls were made. And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.",

Ed claims the award has a dating problem and could therefore have been made ultra vires.\nI was so stunned by the way this was handled by the new mayor (legal advice or comment was not even sought) that I missed the exact words of the dismissal, but it was dismissed in about four words. Could have been “You can’t have that.” Over so quickly.\nBasically from the Spectators Gallery our council appeared not interested last night in defending itself in public against a charge it may have acted “beyond its powers”, i.e. unconstitutionally. Not only that, but on one of the most politically contentious areas of its responsibility: executive pay being a marker for escalating levels of inequality in society and in our organisations.\nWhereas various councillors sprang to support Harrington’s dismissed second motion (which by then was history), not a single councillor supported Ed Murphy’s assertion (either properly at the time or subsequently by way of solidarity or rhetorical effect – both options being wide open to them).\nIt seems to me that there are at least three possible explanations:\nWhich is it? Or is there another?\nSo glad I’m not the minutes secretary!\nI did look up the Phrase and I am still no wiser.\nLikeLike\n“ultra vires” means “beyond powers” according to google translate.\nBasically when an organisation decides what it can do and how those things should be done it gives itself carefully defined powers. (Some organisations might have “standing orders” which define the boundaries of what is OK in exactly the same way.) When that very organisation then does something it didn’t decide it could do or does it in a way it didn’t authorise, it acts beyond the very powers it defined for itself.\nThat could amount to maladministration, which is extremely serious. It could be illegal. It could be merely improper. It could be unenforceable in a court of law. All sorts of uselessnesses.\nBut a “verdict” on what level of offence is committed needs to be arrived at in some sort of orderly fashion, such as that provided by the Ombudsman.\nI don’t know whether anybody complained to the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman can’t investigate if an issue is not raised in the correct fashion.\nI don’t know whether Peterborough City Councillors understand any of the above. Nor why Ed Murphy’s very important point failed to resonate with ANY of them.\nI don’t know whether or not Peterborough City Law officers are responsible for the council’s standing orders.\nLikeLike\nHello Fiona,\nI am very sorry to read about this councils latest abuse of power, which can be added to a very long list of examples that I am personally aware of. I do not think there is any doubt that as long as the conservatives remain in un-opposed control, Peterborough will remain a ‘rotten borough’, in many peoples eyes, and as long as the ombustman contiues its unofficial policy of siding with the council, what-ever the evidenve, I see no possability of justice playing any part in decision making here.\nI would be interested to read any sugestions as to what, if anything can be done to make the people who govern us in any way accountable for their actions,\nReagards,\nAlan\nLikeLike\nHello Alan Sorry for the delay in responding. I lost the comments to my blog when wordpress.com changed the engineering behind the scenes. I’m now catching up with the improvements (I’m graduating from aaargh! to ooooooh!) and found lots of new followers and your comment.\nI did read your comment at the time, but wasn’t sure how I could respond, especially to your last question. You couldn’t ask a bigger or more important question. I don’t have a complete answer for you and I doubt anybody else has. I do have lots of ideas and am doing my best to get some of these off the ground.\nbtw I don’t go along with your statement “…as long as the ombudsman continues its unofficial policy of siding with the council, whatever the evidence…” I can’t agree to what you say here because I’ve not seen evidence of ombudsman bias of this sort. If you have something substantial I could refer to on this perhaps you could point me in the right direction?\nLikeLike",

Again.

Happy as always to be corrected.\nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST – FOI-14-0299 A1139 Fletton Parkway\nAlthough it looks from this document as if there were “site supervision and clerk of works functions” identified, it is clear that one contractor to the council appointed another contractor to the contractor to perform the roles. This is not the same as having one qualified person on one’s own team and begs the question who the possibly qualified person was. Happy as always to be corrected.\nIf Clerk of Works is the role which secures budgetary control (see above video), why isn’t Morson (the contractor apparently covering the role) picking up 100% of the £4.5M cost overrun? One way to establish the reason for this would be to subject the relevant contracts and subcontracts to scrutiny by a person competent in law of contract.\nPersonally, if I were the council I’d bring the role of Clerk of Works straight back in-house to establish and secure a clear line of responsibility and management. A good properly qualified person in this role could save the city a fortune over time. I know that breathtaking achievements (even if you only count the beans) are often made, quietly and without a brass band, by people doing this sort of job for other organisations.\nInformation on the history of the role of Clerk of Works within Peterborough City Council’s remit very welcome.\nOne thought on “First Spalding Road.

If this committee does not “call-in” the decision the council is expected to proceed with incineration plans which still can’t be examined by the public.\nDocuments showing council’s current thinking and a brief history of its proposal for an EfW plant has been circulated to councillors. These documents reveal that fears which have often been expressed about the city’s recycling (how it does it and how much it does) and even bigger worries about incineration replacing recycling could well be justified.\nThe EfW plant was discussed at ITEM 5. Waste 2020 Programme- Energy from Waste Facility And Other Associated Works and Services Part of the discussion was to be “exempt”. The agenda item reads as follows, although the highlighting is mine:\n“In accordance with Standing Orders, Members are asked to determine whether the update report to be tabled at the meeting relating to agenda item 5. Waste 2020 Programme – Energy From Waste Facility which contains exempt appendices containing information relating to the financial or business affairs of a particular person (including the authority holding that information), as defined by Paragraph 3 of Schedule 12A of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1972, should be exempt and the press and public excluded from the meeting when these appendices are discussed or whether the public interest in disclosing this information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.”\nI asked from the public seating area that members be given the opportunity to vote on excluding members of the public because the chair seemed to be telling us to leave at the outset of ITEM 5 and without any vote. They were then allowed to vote. The chair also had to be persuaded by council officers that part of ITEM 5 could be discussed in public and that the exclusion could follow discussion of that part rather than apply to the whole item.\nHowever no discussion took place in this committee on the relative merits of the “public interest in disclosing” as opposed to the “public interest in maintaining the exemption” and it was not clear to me that members of the committee understood that standing orders provided them with an opportunity to debate the relative pros and cons of sharing the information with the public. The chair of the committee refused to let me raise this.\nThe public interest in disclosing is overwhelming in my view. I believe that this committee was led by its chair into a breach of its own standing orders by not having any debate about where the balance of public interest lay: whether it was better for the city to have disclosure or not. Members of the committee were simply not asked to contribute their thoughts on the subject or debate it before they were asked to vote.\nFor some members of the newly formed opposition (Independent/Labour) this was their first time sitting on this committee. I don’t know how they felt but I was in a state of mild shock by the time we were thrown out.\nPeterborough City Council’s call-in procedure\nrequires two members of a scrutiny committee to complete a form explaining the reasons for a call-in (eg failure to follow due process). The affected committee (the one within whose remit the decision takes place) then has to meet within 10 days to uphold the call-in or recommend action.\nOther councils’ procedures: Hackney Hertsmere Laudably, Thurrock Council provides for both its elected Members and the public to call-in these decisions prior to implementation.\nPeterborough has “suspended” its own call-in procedure on four occasions in 2005\n15 – 17th June: Festival on the Green (Botolph Green)\nPlease click on the title to find the Programme.\nCommunications and social media workshop – roll up, roll up! – Citizen Power: Peterborough\n“This free workshop is aimed at community groups and people who work with community groups and is a fantastic opportunity to find out more about social media (like Twitter, Facebook and blogs etc) and how it can enable you to get people more engaged and participating in what you are doing.\nSo, if you either know very little about social media and want to find out more or if you are already using social media this will provide the opportunity to compare experiences.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_planning_page_2/content_56.html": "Since I wrote that blog, I’ve been told that the reason nothing has been done to repair the broken path is that Peterborough City Council, (possibly Environment Agency) and one or more developers can’t agree on who owns the path and also that it was built out over the river without planning or any other kind of permission (I’m not sure what the procedure is for building out into a river). As ever I’m happy to be corrected if I have been misinformed this latter point. A slightly different story appeared almost a year ago, when a swift end to the legal tangle, (but apparently not involving the EA) was expected. It suggests that the council agrees it owns the surface of the path. But not its foundations. (Could that happen and if so, how could it have arisen?)\nA legal battle may make it awkward for the parties to it to speak to the press. But two of those parties are funded by the tax payer and the tax payer should be told why a solution and suitable repair could not precede settlement of the case. The costs could be recouped – if necessary – by means of a legal charge on the property. If the path is a property which was built by means of illegal invasion of the river, which seems a bit unlikely, what is the remedy in law? Does an illegal property exist or is it a bit like Schrödinger’s cat? Can a property which should not even be there be compulsorily purchased or confiscated? Can it even have an owner? Could a proper repair cost more than the value of a shoddy property (I’d bet it could). I think we should be told.\nMost unfortunately the council has set an awful precedent in Park Ward, where a drain it was given by Peterborough Development Corporation was built out into by a neighbouring property owner and a hideous building was given retrospective planning permission. So the council has established a flabby attitude to allowing people to develop beyond their own boundaries and into its watery properties (not something I condone or recommend).\nBut even if the story I was told holds water, it should be possible to find out who built a path on the bank capable of being washed away. While the flats were under construction, the whole site was fenced off, so the general public would not have been able to see anything. Is the organisation which built a soluble embankment still in business?\nIt should be possible to establish the position of the river bank before and after the flats were built. It should be possible to find out how many building regulations checks were performed as the flats were built and whether or not the rogue path was spotted or anything done about it during the flats’ construction. This is something the council’s planning department should be able to establish. I don’t have photographs. But someone must have some.\nI’ve been assured that no danger is posed to the buildings, but even if this is true, it is not the impression given by the landscaping: the dodgy path appears to have been held up by a steel retaining wall which has very definitely failed. It isn’t clear to the casual passer by (even if it is to the council’s structural engineering expert) what is holding the flats up. If the council’s building inspectors missed a dodgy retaining wall, can we be sure that they checked the one which may or may not be behind the dodgy one and which may or not be holding the embankment under the flats in place?\nThe path poses obvious hazards to pedestrians and cyclists and has, rightly, been closed. However repairs to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, even in Central Ward in Peterborough does not carry the priority it would if the route happened to carry cars. This despite the fact that the path is on the tourist trail. Peterborough remains a car crazy city and unattractive damage to the north bank river path persists apparently unnoticed by the city’s elected members. Voters should note that Cllr Jamil’s current term of office ends in May.\nWhy Bourges Boulevard continues to flood – some possible reasons\nIt is remarkable that Peterborough City Council and Anglian Water can’t seem to get together to clear and improve drainage on Bourges Boulevard just south of the roundabout at Town Bridge. Flooding at this location often happens in very heavy rain and is reported in the local paper, which used to have its big blue sign on a fancy modern office overlooking the roundabout. (The Peterborough Telegraph has since moved out of the city centre.)\nSo what is going wrong?\nAre Anglian Water and the City Council not talking to one another?\nSo are people not reporting poo pongs to Anglian Water?\nWell, oddly, it isn’t possible to report or describe this particular phenomenon accurately using Anglian Water’s ludicrously coy website. There is no free text field on its reporting forms, and every option avoids any mention of the blocking or the contents of sewers.\nI recently tried to report this problem at a different location and stumbled across this inexplicable reporting obstacle. The closest to a poo-stink-likely-to-be-a-drainage-problem I was able to report referred me to the “local drainage authority” (which in Peterborough is Peterborough City Council). Anglian Water’s reporting system also asks for my water account details, which are as relevant to a drainage problem wherever I happen to find it as my inside leg measurement. So, a bit cross, I rang them up. I know this is inadequate, but it is all I can recommend at the moment. So\nIf you smell poo, do a number one and a number two:\none: telephone Anglian Water on 0345 145 145\nand\ntwo: phone Peterborough City Council on 01733 747474\nIf anyone can identify a not so intrusive email address for Anglian Water, please put it in the comments, below. If you are happy to provide details of your personal water account (if you have one) when reporting an issue in the public realm you can report it using Anglian Water’s online form.\nIs Peterborough City Council a competent drainage authority?\nI’m not sure that the council is aware that when Peterborough Development Corporation handed its brief and assets over to the council, that package included drainage assets and all drainage authority responsibilities. The drainage boards outside the boundary of the council can be found online and there is local democratic involvement in their management: they are active and if there were to be a problem there is a democratic remedy available to local people. Peterborough City Council seems to think that if it ignores them, its drainage assets will look after themselves. This is certainly what happened in Park Ward, when a development on, and its “foundations” in a drain was permitted and the council remarkably failed to assert ownership of the drainage ditch (which it nevertheless clears from time to time). The development made the ditch less manageable and this resulted in a viable long term prospective asset owner walking away. But whatever its position since PDC handed drainage over to it, it has not been able to evade its responsibilities since 2010, when a law was enacted:\n“County and Unitary Authorities have been made Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs) under the Flood & Water Management Act 2010 with responsibilities to prepare and maintain a strategy for local flood risk management in their areas; maintain a register of flood management assets; investigate significant local flooding incidents; issue consents for altering, removing or replacing certain structures or features on ordinary watercourses (outside of Internal Drainage Districts) and play a lead role in emergency planning and recovery after a flood event.” https://www.ada.org.uk/member_type/local-authorities/\nAre Peterborough’s elected members aware of the council’s inherited drainage responsibilities?\nEvidence that they do is welcome.\nIs Peterborough City Council adequately funded to manage its drainage responsibilities?\nLegacy funding was never made available to the council when PDC was abruptly removed from continuing its work to develop and improve Peterborough. This explains the council’s ongoing difficulties funding the maintenance of the landscape the PDC built, including the Green Wheel. Central government has owed the city development infrastructure legacy funding since PDC left. In better economic times, it might have been possible to blur this. But now that the council is up against predictably far heavier rain (due to climate change) and impossible cuts (due to appalling decisions by central government), it makes sense now to claim what’s been due. The city has two MPs. The two of them should be able to do this for the city. They should also know whether other unitary authorities are also owed this funding.\nSo, until I find evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that no, it isn’t.\nIs Peterborough City Council competent to manage drainage and sewer works?\nI welcome evidence that it is. The prevalence of sewage pongs suggests it isn’t. As do the reports listed on the Anglian Water website, which lists long standing sewer repairs still not completed.\nThe city council claims to be under pressure to get its plans for Fletton Quays built. It is so anxious about this that it plans to decant itself from its own rather lovely Town Hall in Bridge Street so that it can rent out the space and encourage companies to join it on the other side of the river in a patch of land which would make a lovely river park or walkway and serve as a rain shed for the city, even a flood plain, if we were thinking in a truly sustainable way about what a river bank really is.\nThe nature of this pressure is not fully understood. At least I don’t understand it: I simply don’t share it, and given the amount of empty space available in the city, residential, retail and commercial, I admit to being bewildered.\nI am wondering also if the nature of the pressure is a bit more complicated and also whether the council isn’t so much being pressurised, as positively rushed into what could be a potentially very damaging decision. A decision is scheduled to be made at 10am on Monday morning. Are we sure we understand what the rush is all about?\nA few of us have been looking at the detail behind the company the council is planning to lend money to: Norlin Hotels Holdings Limited.\nNorlin Hotels Holdings Limited turns out to be one of a huge network of companies and a couple of people have spent a day or two hunting for assets, a history of solid achievement, or anything to reassure us that this is a good thing. So far we haven’t come across much to reassure us. In fact warning lights are flashing everywhere.\nThe company is based in Northern Ireland. One of its directors is Stephen Brian Symington.\nWhy would Peterborough not opt for a local developer? Local builders? A local workforce? Is the company it is talking to really based in Northern Ireland, or is it just an address?\nI remember talking to people working on the academy building project and they told me that they came up from London every day by bus. One of the men I spoke to had only recently arrived from Africa which really got me thinking about the nature of the investment and exactly how it was managed and who benefited most from the choice of workforce. Looking back now, I wonder what would this man have done if his manager wanted to skimp on wall ties, for example? What were his skills? How well qualified was he? Was he in a position to probe something if it did worry him? Was his immigration status a problem for him? Could this put him in difficulties in negotiations with an employer? There is no evidence of a problem like the wall tie scandal happening in Peterborough, but a wall certainly did collapse for want of a few ties in Scotland. What complicated decisions led to that? We need to stop assuming that everything is done for our benefit and we need to start asking basic questions.\nWhat was the tender process? Who got involved?\nWho benefits from the decision to appoint a Northern Irish developer?\nPhotos from Stephen Symington’s facebook profile\nWho is the developer? What do we know about them? Why is Peterborough, home of bricks, having to go so far to find a builder? Why is the council, which is so keen to focus on a “circular economy” not focussing locally and looking at people who have been educated and trained locally? Shouldn’t we be shortening the distances workers need to travel to find work?\nThen I see “Antigua” in an associated company’s name and I start thinking about tax havens. Quite a bit of Peterborough is now owned by offshore companies. This lowers the tax revenue available to central government. Has this got something to do with the city’s choice of company? What is the council’s approach to companies domiciled in a tax haven?\nAnd then since June it simply is not possible to ignore the heaviest political pressure on the Conservatives. Since the General Election, the Conservative Party has been and remains totally dependent on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to maintain its grip on power in Westminster. It is unlikely that the support is provided freely: the DUP is not known for being soft or a push over. Northern Ireland politicians will be trying to get as much out of this situation as they possibly can: and rightly so. But then, how exactly are they doing this? Could there be a party political aspect to the council’s choice of company? Is leverage being applied? If so is the council in a position to understand that sort of pressure, and to fully understand any risks which might be entailed?\nThe key issue is risk. What risks is the council running and has it got its eyes fully open to potential risks?\nI’ve spent the whole day (unpaid) searching for evidence that these two directors are experts in developing hotels. I haven’t found it. Others have had exactly the same experience. I’ve looked at all the active companies which have Symington or Irwin as a director. I’ve discovered that these two directors work closely together, that this set of companies is large and some are involved fun in the food industry, the racing sector, one or two are in the movie sector and that quite a few of them don’t file their accounts on time and several owe money to all sorts of financial institutions. Eastonville Investments Limited is controlled by a company based in the Cayman Islands, so I have no idea if the assets I was expecting to find are stashed safely and invisibly over there. I still think the organisation the council is talking to (which I still can’t really see as a functioning entity online – no website, for example or contact details) should be able to get a commercial bank loan if they have a viable business in our city, which I very very strongly doubt they do have, especially since they are hooked in to the old model of a hotel, rather than the fantastically popular AirB&B concept. The only company which has bothered with a website appears to be in biotech and has not thrived. Even if the hotel is a brilliant success, what impact will it have on the hotel sector already in the city? One hotel has already become infamous for housing Peterborough’s steadily growing homeless population. Is the Hilton chain really wanting to come to Peterborough?\nIf it goes wrong, the council will end up owing money against land it currently owns outright and owes nothing on, but which could fall dramatically in value in relation to any loaned amount borrowed against it. If that were to happen, the council tax payer will pick up the bill. Cllr David Seaton has honourably promised to resign if it does go pear shaped, but, frankly, resignation won’t cost him £15M.\nNor do I believe that our local council should in any way be in the business of baling out a bit of Northern Irish commercial property. The registered address of a network of companies, including the one which the council is proposing to deal with is 41-43 Waring Street, Belfast, County Antrim, BT1 2DY. And Waring Street Limited is also the name of a company. This is what that address looks like on google maps:\n41-43 Waring Street, Belfast, County Antrim, BT1 2DY\nI have asked people why the council hadn’t gone all out to fund a replacement bridge as soon as it realised Rhubarb Bridge was suffering an unusual degree of decay. This would have made sense, especially since there are national funding pots for sustainable travel infrastructure, and this bridge might well have qualified.\nSince then I have I received one really useful reply. My interlocutor pointed out to me that the money for repairs and maintenance comes out of the Revenue pot at the council. Revenue is for running costs, costs which recur year after year. The money for the an surface roundabout or for a replacement bridge would come out of the Capital pot. Capital is for one off costs, for buying or building assets such as buildings and infrastructure.\nThis made me think. Pressure on the Revenue pot is extreme. And it might be this extreme funding pressure which is leading to a decision not to maintain. If it replaces an an annual maintenance bill with a one off capital bill (with arguably a smaller ongoing maintenance cost), it will be relieving pressure on the funds which are needed to look after people in extreme need.\nFunding pressures on local government affect their Revenue funding primarily. Pressure on capital funding is not as bad. Revenue funds are used to fund social care, road repairs and waste disposal. It is this funding stream which is under impossible strains as central government imposes its Austerity measures and renders all our services less and less able to cope. So all local authorities have to balance roads and waste against social care. It is quite clearly insane, but until we sack the government as we are entitled to do at each general election, there is no sign of a change in this wicked situation. And local authority roads get a small fraction of the maintenance money which Highways England gets to maintain trunk roads. Unfortunately Rhubarb Bridge does not belong to Highways England. It belongs to the council.\nThis leaves a number of items which haven’t been accounted for: lets call them uncounted elephants in the room:\nThe likely cost of accidents at an at surface crossing. It is clear that this has not been factored in. There is clearly an increased risk of impacts on emergency, hospital and care services budgets.\nThe impact of being at ground level at an air pollution hot spot on all pedestrian and cyclists using the route. The higher you are the less likely you are to be inhaling high concentrates of particulates. The closer you are the more certain it is. In pushchairs children are face to face with exhaust pipes and this is just one reason (of many) why parents pop them in what seems to be the safer environment of a car.\nThe at surface crossing will result in cyclists taking to the road, rather than wait.\nThe at surface crossing will result in people getting into a car in preference to walking with a pram or pushchair.\nAnd it leaves my original question standing: why the council hasn’t tried to get hold of (let us add “capital”) funding to rebuild the bridge – if it is beyond economic repair?\nAn event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).\nI attended an event last Thursday which was about Rhubarb Bridge, but before I post anything about that, this is just a little news about the next bridge over the A47 going east (towards Wisbech). This bridge is on Highways England’s list of repairs and should be getting some much needed attention very soon. I hope it isn’t closed for long. It is certainly not planned for demolition. It is a useful bridge enabling cyclists and pedestrians to shortcircuit (North /South) one of Peterborough’s oddest and most confusing roundabouts over and onto the A47 (as it goes East/West).\nJames Palmer is the Conservative candidate expecting to be crowned Mayor of the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on May 4th. Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nCentres of population in Cambridgeshire, in order of size of population\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarkedgets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nCyclists, pedestrians and a runner gather at Rhubarb Bridge\n@SustransPBoro and Peterborough Cycling Forum members gathered this week to protest against the proposal (announced in the council’s budget) to demolish Rhubarb Bridge. Follow Sustrans Peterborough on facebook. A member of the Werrington Running Club explained that the running club members use the bridge. While we were there the bridge was never empty: children were making their way to school: many pupils at Voyager school will get to school via this bridge and commuters were cycling and walking over it.\nOn top of the bridge, it ducks under the A47: the path descends a bit, making it an up and under bridge. It is an extraordinary design and in its day was very innovative. It is difficult to envisage a better design, given the continuous roar of traffic along the A47 crosses the Lincoln Road here: the main trunk route north out of Peterborough. Rhubarb Bridge (apparently so called because rhubarb kept coming up on its embankments when it was newly built) allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross two major roads on a set of off road, fully segregated paths, ramps and steps. There is absolutely no conflict with road traffic, which as things are, only stops for more road traffic.\nThe only road user who is not catered for, is (possibly) someone using a wheelchair or mobility scooter. There are ramps and they are certainly no steeper than many hills, but on the morning of our photoshoot, I did not see anyone attempt them in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter (which are very popular in Peterborough).\nTalking to pedestrians in the dip in the bridge: where the bridge goes down into a tunnel under the A47\nFluorescent (?) light cover in the ceiling of the tunnel\nThe tunnel was unlit at 8am. It is possible to see quite well inside it. But it is not the most beautiful of Peterborough’s underpasses\nUpdate 2: The two men who died between Yaxley and Farcet\nMy blog was partly about the alienating effect of cars and our road infrastructure and understanding why car parks and bridges over roads are chosen by suicidal (women, most often). As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_05_07_my-bank-holiday-a-filthy-fire/content_579.html": "My intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough.

Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nFirstly, Peterborough is BIGGER than Cambridge.\nI occasionally make just this point and people look at me as if I was mad. But yes it has been for a while and it still is. I’ve just double checked last census data available on Wikipedia:\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarked gets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn order to make something perfectly clear to your colleagues in a democratic forum it is a legal requirement to declare your interests. It is a criminal offence not to, if it happens to be a pecuniary interest. For some obscure reason, this requirement appears not to have been applied (at least by means of a publicly accessible document) by our Local Enterprise Partnership, until the MP complained. The Register is now available online and forms part of a section on Corporate Governance.\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nMeanwhile I’d love to know what you think.\nAnd if you happen to live in Chatteris or in Wisbech, I hope you vote for Julie too!\n@SustransPBoro and Peterborough Cycling Forum members gathered this week to protest against the proposal (announced in the council’s budget) to demolish Rhubarb Bridge. Follow Sustrans Peterborough on facebook. A member of the Werrington Running Club explained that the running club members use the bridge. While we were there the bridge was never empty: children were making their way to school: many pupils at Voyager school will get to school via this bridge and commuters were cycling and walking over it.\nOn top of the bridge, it ducks under the A47: the path descends a bit, making it an up and under bridge. It is an extraordinary design and in its day was very innovative. It is difficult to envisage a better design, given the continuous roar of traffic along the A47 crosses the Lincoln Road here: the main trunk route north out of Peterborough. Rhubarb Bridge (apparently so called because rhubarb kept coming up on its embankments when it was newly built) allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross two major roads on a set of off road, fully segregated paths, ramps and steps. There is absolutely no conflict with road traffic, which as things are, only stops for more road traffic.\nThe only road user who is not catered for, is (possibly) someone using a wheelchair or mobility scooter. There are ramps and they are certainly no steeper than many hills, but on the morning of our photoshoot, I did not see anyone attempt them in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter (which are very popular in Peterborough).",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2013_10_09_peterborough-council-leader-would-like-to-ban-cycling-in-entire-city-centre/content_580.html": "This evening Cllr Darren Fower proposed a motion at Full Council. The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.\nI despair at the level of ill-informedness and lack of vision displayed by our esteemed local representatives. What is that they do not understand from the experience of a growing number of UK towns and cities and the considerable weight of real evidence from the continent where vibrant, pleasant, safe, often car-free, shared-use cities and town centres are the norm? The levels of cycling are tens of times more than in Peterborough and there is not a problem about pedestrian and cyclist conflict. The aged, Peterborough cycle route ‘network’ is incomplete and much of it is sub-standard, often causing more problems and safety issues than it seeks to overcome. We then wonder why cyclists often don’t use these ‘facilities’. Similarly, those fortunate enough to have cars, continue to use them and kill and seriously injure pedestrians and cyclists in and around this pro-car environment that is Peterborough. How many pedestrians are killed or seriously injured by cyclists? I believe that the facts are that more cyclists are killed or injured avoiding cyclists who step out in front of them when they are cycling on the roads! I am a car owner and I am not anti-car, there’s just a time and a place for the car. More cycling = safer cycling. The sooner that Peterborough politicians work this out, the better will be our city and the health and well-being of its citizens.\nLikeLike\nGood comments and I agree that cycling should be encouraged i.e. people should use bicycles more, rather than relying on cars.\nHowever, there is conflict between cyclists and pedestrians and it needs to be managed and prevented. My comments are based largely on what I have seen in London. Perhaps there are towns or cities elsewhere in the UK that have good arrangements for cycle lanes – I have not seen any.\nA lot of the conflict is due to (as Rob mentions) sub-standard cycle lanes. If you go to a European city such as Munich you see cycle lanes which are dedicated to cyclists, they are wide and have clear boundaries and proper signage (warnings to pedestrians etc.) and they are largely continuous except at road intersections.\nIn the UK so-called cycle lanes are often created by simply painting white lines on portions of existing roads for motor vehicles, with no boundary or barrier. They tend to be very narrow, only wide enough for one cycle. The cycle lanes are discontinuous. Cyclists using them are forced to exit them to travel in the same lanes as motor vehicles or on the pavement with pedestrians. This is unacceptable and dangerous. It is not surprising that cyclists often choose to either travel along with motor vehicles or wholly on the pavement.\nThere will always be a proportion of cyclists who ride irresponsibly. However, good design of cycle lanes would reduce the harmful consequences.\nMark Harris\nLikeLike\nI think that cyclists should be prevented from cycling in towns and cities in areas intended for people to walk in such as car-free pedestrian precincts and pavements. That is how it used to be.\nCycle lanes are often badly located and they often intersect pedestrian walkways. Cyclists are often abusive to pedestrians and cycle in an unsafe way (the less competent riders tending to ride on the pavement). Collisions occur between cyclists and pedestrians. Cyclists do not care much for the needs of pedestrians and see them as a nuisance. Surely pedestrians should have right of way over cyclists in a pedestrian area.\nIt is true that cyclists sometimes collide with motor vehicles on roads, but that is irrelevant in pedestrian zones. In any case, directing cyclists to cycle among pedestrians is not a solution, it is a very bad idea.\nMark Harris\nLikeLike",

I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nJulie Howell, the Green Party’s mayoral candidate for the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (which includes Huntingdonshire) went to the Treasury in the snow to protest the underfunding of Peterborough.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_pollution/content_460.html": "Picture is at http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/aqma/lis… and the status of the Air Quality Management Area (two small areas in Whittlesey) has not changed since 2007 when the breach of legal limits was notified to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).\nPeterborough City Council’s other progress on air pollution since then:\nCouncil has never had a public information campaign to stop domestic and commercial burning of landfill, construction and commercial wastes, which is particularly prevalent in high housing turnover areas close to the railway station. Smoke and smog affect visitors’ perceptions of the city as they step onto the platform and air quality has a serious and ongoing impact on residents’ health and wellbeing. Many people living in the city have actually forgotten what fresh air smells like: they are no longer aware they are living in smoggy conditions: they simply don’t smell the smoke any more. These fires (many of them illegal) are set in the evening, just as council officers go home and since they are usually “safe” (i.e. someone is supervising the fire and it isn’t getting out of control) the fire brigade is not required to take action.\nCouncil decided to approve, construct and launch (2016) its very own landfill waste incinerator with Cllr Kreling (on the planning committee at the time of approval) observing that if she couldn’t see anything coming out of the stack (the planning committee was taken on a tour of a similar monster), nothing was coming out. The council has never agreed to and is not live streaming data about its emissions from the stack.\nPeterborough Renewable Energy Limited who were the first to propose an incinerator for the city did agree to live stream their emissions data on their website. But this is not the incinerator which has gone live.\nThe Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor for East Ward, the ward with both planned incinerators sitting in it, offered to throw Richard Olive and me out of the council chamber She couldn’t throw us out because she couldn’t find a bailiff. But she was perfectly able to make a lousy decision without listening to evidence. For me, this was my introduction to the realities of politics in Peterborough. Most people have a vague sense of trust in their elected representatives. I lost whatever tiny bit I had left that day.\nBetween then and now council decided to knock down and pulverise numbers of large buildings made of brick, cement and plaster (Thomas Deacon School and several other predecessor-to-PFI schools, Bridge House, Peterborough District Hospital & assorted buildings on site). No dust suppression in place during the works and no coverage of the remaining mountains of dust (I observed the 20 ft high mountain of grey dust next to Aldermans Drive yesterday: 14th March 2016).\nThe Junction of Taverners Road with Bourges Boulevard is close to and downwind of the pile of pulverised sky scraper hospital and is also in a high density residential area. This junction is now close to breaching traffic pollution limits and that is according to official monitors. Are we surprised? Hardly. Cough Cough.\nIn London it has been shown that official monitoring is significantly understating the true state of affairs: http://cleanair.london/?s=monitorin…\nPeople feel there is nothing they can do. But there are a few things.\nMore people need to observe democracy in action, even if it does mean risking getting thrown out of meetings. The dishonour of getting thrown out is not yours.\nWe could choose not to reelect councillors who fail to help improve air quality and who drive themselves around in heavy overpowered diesel vehicles.\nWe could vote in councillors who don’t drive. Or who drive electric, hybrid and low emissions vehicles. The importance of leadership cannot be overstated.\nWe could vote in councillors who understand that a 20mph speed limit in Peterborough’s residential streets would make cycling and walking pleasanter and would reduce the number of journeys taken by car.\nWe could find a real time air pollution app which relies on independent air monitoring and which works in Peterborough, so that we are not obliged to rely solely on council owned data.\nThe council could live stream its incinerator emissions and on street air pollution monitoring data on its website. If it is proud of what it is doing, there should be no qualms in showing off its achievements.\nFor a second day running it has not been possible to see the sun in Peterborough at 09:30. I had made a note to check where it would be on Friday (tomorrow) when there is a chance to witness a near total solar eclipse. People have made plans and some have plotted parties and bought cameras, filters, projectors and protective eye wear, ready for the big day.\nI joined the Green Party in 2007 as I tried to reverse Peterborough City Council’s decision to support the incineration of domestic waste. This was a battle which we campaigners lost. We saw a neighbouring proposal fall in the face of a far more successful campaign. Lessons were learned, as they say. And I started to consider the vexed question of what exactly drives politics in Peterborough.\nThen in an online discussion elsewhere entirely about this morning’s fog, someone shared this video which I hadn’t come across previously. The story of this video’s making and removal from Chinese social media is available online. I just wish that we’d had this video at the time the council’s decision was still not made. At the notorious moment when Pam Kreling (then one of the councillors making the crucial decision about whether or not to use incineration) said words to the effect that if she couldn’t see anything emerging from a stack, then there was nothing there and there was by implication nothing which could do anyone any harm. As campaigners we weren’t allowed to speak at critical moments in meetings: in fact the chair of one of the meetings offered to have me and Richard Olive thrown out when we stood up to tell them they were being hopelessly misinformed by their advisors. But as I observed this pantomime (there was no beadle to implement the Chair’s desire) I was left reeling from a deeper revelation. I still wonder how people in key positions got through even basic level schooling, what exactly went on in their science lessons and what their marks were.\nBut the following Monday I received a very different second response. This one from Cllr John Shearman (here he is).\nFirst of all he apologises for not replying sooner. Frankly speediness of response is not the most important thing to me. And since I wrote about a jargon-prone subject which most people would find technical, difficult and tedious an over speedy response really wouldn’t impress me.\nBut offering an apology for responding within a week achieves so much. Starting like this says to me (these are my words, not his) “Hello, I am a human being with manners and I understand the common courtesies. Moreover I have standards: they are mine and…..”\nI don’t need to go on. And nor will I copy onto my blog the content of his response or our subsequent conversations. That would be impolite: he has expressed himself to me honestly, frankly and (absolutely critically important to me, and to anything relating to planning) he comes over as open-minded and prepared to listen. That is what I think people expect of a ward councillor.\nAnd, best of all, from what he says I can see that he has done his homework and understands the incinerator campaign work which has being quietly going on in the city. His email is a very tiny but very concise executive summary of how the situation actually is. Hats off.\nThank you, John.\nI am still waiting for a response from the third of my ward councillors.\nToday I wrote in the following terms to my ward councillors, copying in my MP.\nmass burn incinerator for household waste\nI invite your comments on how you have protected the interests of the residents of my ward and of the city in the years since 2007 in this matter.\nShould the council reconsider what it is doing: What would the costs of pulling out of this contract be today? And tomorrow (assuming it is signed tomorrow)?\nHave you checked whether or not the council considered options other than incineration? What evidence of careful consideration of other options are you relying on? Are you aware that the council has been consistently challenged on this since 2007, (and possibly earlier)?\nAre you aware that the business cases for incineration in general and for this particular incinerator are both now being challenged as unsafe (the economy and the market having changed substantially)? Have you considered the financial impact on council tax payers should these cautions turn out to be well founded? And that if the business performs as badly as expected are you aware of the likely impact on recycling, too?\nHas the contract been set up in such a way that it can attract structural or grant funding? Or has it been set up in such a way that it is ineligible?\nAre you aware of the total cost of this contract? Figures of £76M and £80M have been quoted recently in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph for the capital costs alone. Is that figure current? What are the overall 30 year costs for this project? Is it acceptable that this information is still not in the public domain? Is it acceptable that innocent readers of their local paper might assume that this figure is the total cost of the project?\nAre you aware that the council is deliberately choosing out of date technology and describing it as “tried and tested”? (the information on technology is still not in the public domain).\nAre you aware that the council might be comparing the energy recovery of its own plant with Scandinavian examples? If so are you aware that in Scandinavia (which is used to colder weather and historically much more aware of the importance of insulation and energy security) high performance hot water supply grids are planned in (eg for swimming pools or district heating). Peterborough has not planned a supply grid and has not explained who will buy energy and power generated by this incinerator. Have you seen an example of the output and recovery figures from either Peterborough’s as planned and have you compared that with an operational equivalent in Scandinavia and an operational equivalent in the UK (local campaigners are finding that those in the UK can’t sell their power).\nAre you aware that the UK’s statutory regulatory regime for air pollution (in which the council has placed its trust) is widely regarded as unfit for purpose? The Health Protection Agency is about to undertake research into whether or not it can substantiate the assurances and claims it has been making and upon which the Environment Agency and numerous councils have historically relied. Is the council aware of the potential damage it could do to its own Environment Capital “aspiration” if, as widely expected, it can’t?\nDo you know enough about air pollution and monitoring in the city? Does Peterborough monitor anything other than road traffic? Where are the monitoring stations and are they in the right places? What regime is planned for when the incinerator is operational?\nHave you considered the social, health and cost impacts on the city of a mass burn incinerator in an area with very high (and rising) levels of social deprivation?\nAre you aware that a new incinerator on an industrial site in Fletton is operating and is apparently making people ill, but that the council has not done anything about it, and that not one person amongst the “officers’ panel” and members present at the Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee Call in Meeting on 29th August was equipped to advise the ward councillor who asked about this problem in his ward? I understand that the ward councillor had been told by the Environment Agency that it was a matter for the council. As a member of the public I witnessed that not a single person actually knew how to deal with this relatively small problem – nobody offered to look into it or explain who the ward councillor should talk to, if it wasn’t the Environment Agency. This is despite the presence of senior council officers and (at least) three lawyers.\nAre you satisfied with the monitoring and regulation of pollution in the city?\nCan you write NONE against – or otherwise provide detail of any personal, family or party interest you have had, have or are likely to have – in any of the following:\nOn Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nMy intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough. What do you think?\nMeanwhile thank you to Blue Watch at Dogsthorpe Fire Station for helping today!",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_06_13_watching-the-grass-grow-in-peterborough/content_255.html": "A grassy walk in Peterborough Social media lit up in Peterborough last week and the topic was grass on a recreation field which had grown to one metre tall. So on Wednesday when Sue said shall we go for a walk in the Boardwalks? I thought: I really need to switch off and there could be some grass there! And indeed: lots of different kinds of grasses, with seed heads blowing about in the wind. You can watch the dance of the seed heads as the wind makes huge ripples across the meadow. This is the entrance to the boardwalks, I am wondering how high this grass is and how much is reeds and sedges and which is which. I don’t know my grasses. Recent very heavy rain has damaged the boardwalk, which was built in the 80s. This marshy area is a tiny patch of an important flood plain for the river Nene. By absorbing and retaining river and rainwater upstream soft squidgy places like this help to protect the city. Fit people can cross the boardwalk here, but please be very very careful. Might be three quarters of a pint of water in there with all sorts floating in it. Lovely fuzzy teasels. Here we say goodbye to the Boardwalk. A large grey heron with wings spread out, presumably to dry. Looks like a weird sculpture from a distance. I was just about to get the perfect shot from much closer up, but pushing our bikes along, we startled it, and off it went. (We’d cycled to get to the boardwalks and were now back on our bikes.). Found this not so delightful plant very close to the city centre. This is Japanese Knotweed. It is on the verge of Henry Penn walk, north Nene embankment. I have emailed the council and Railworld to find out who this patch of land belongs to: I am guessing it belongs to the council.

They’ve got through to the council and have been told the council is now going after “GKL”. I thought I’d established that they built the building and, presumably the embankment which has subsequently collapsed. The journalist were now being told that this entity is the property manager (which took me completely by surprise). So, RHRL is out of the picture, just for the moment. Which is interesting because as of a couple of days ago, the council’s press office were saying they were going after/in dispute/had settled with RHRL. Weren’t they? Isn’t it the name in the local paper, linked in my second update? Now why would the council’s press office have been saying that if it wasn’t true? Please note that my first assumption is absolutely not that the press office has “made a genuine error” (as claimed by Cllr Fitzgerald over the entirely unrelated cheque gate affair. But that is a whole other scandal.)\nCould this mean that the council is now chasing after a relevant, genuinely responsible entity and that maybe flat owners will not be held liable for the repairs? If so, there is hope.\nNew morning. New search.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_app/content_491.html": "Yesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2015_03_19_will-anybody-in-peterborough-see-tomorrows-solar-eclipse/content_687.html": "For a second day running it has not been possible to see the sun in Peterborough at 09:30. I had made a note to check where it would be on Friday (tomorrow) when there is a chance to witness a near total solar eclipse. People have made plans and some have plotted parties and bought cameras, filters, projectors and protective eye wear, ready for the big day.\nInstead we have “fog”. This is a polite word for particulate laden and polluted air. It might be a lot more accurate to call it “smog”. Yesterday it almost lifted just after lunch and shafts of sunlight penetrated into the city centre. Today we have what looks like heavy cloud. But it is more likely that the smog has simply floated up a bit. The government website is predicting worse pollution levels on Friday than today.\nI joined the Green Party in 2007 as I tried to reverse Peterborough City Council’s decision to support the incineration of domestic waste. This was a battle which we campaigners lost. We saw a neighbouring proposal fall in the face of a far more successful campaign. Lessons were learned, as they say. And I started to consider the vexed question of what exactly drives politics in Peterborough.\nA key supporter of incineration of waste is Cllr Marco Cereste (he is also a director of Peterborough Renewable Energy Limited which builds slightly cleaner incinerators than the one the council is building). As leader of the council he personally attracts huge amounts of anger, frustration and suspicion: some of it reasonable, some of it less so. But in the last couple of weeks he has told the story of his signing (on behalf of the city he represents) a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on his facebook profile (shared with his facebook friends). This MoU is with an entity locals understand is a Chinese government funded organisation, possibly what we’d call in the UK, an “NGO” (non governmental organisation).\nThen in an online discussion elsewhere entirely about this morning’s fog, someone shared this video which I hadn’t come across previously. The story of this video’s making and removal from Chinese social media is available online. I just wish that we’d had this video at the time the council’s decision was still not made. At the notorious moment when Pam Kreling (then one of the councillors making the crucial decision about whether or not to use incineration) said words to the effect that if she couldn’t see anything emerging from a stack, then there was nothing there and there was by implication nothing which could do anyone any harm. As campaigners we weren’t allowed to speak at critical moments in meetings: in fact the chair of one of the meetings offered to have me and Richard Olive thrown out when we stood up to tell them they were being hopelessly misinformed by their advisors. But as I observed this pantomime (there was no beadle to implement the Chair’s desire) I was left reeling from a deeper revelation. I still wonder how people in key positions got through even basic level schooling, what exactly went on in their science lessons and what their marks were.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough_page_3/content_441.html": "The Nene is in flood, still transporting last summer and autumn’s above average rainfall to the Wash and new steadily heavy El Niño winter rain. Since my third update the Conservative administration at Peterborough City Council has been toppled and a well intentioned but inexperienced ex opposition multi party Cabinet is trying to keep the council’s finances afloat and to fix whatever has been going wrong. The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?\nHow to get Santa back when his arrival down your chimney is threatened by UK Government Diktat. Could two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nAll children need to be told about this appalling story broken by Newsthump. Sit them down after they’ve had a good meal and read it as gently and softly as you can. Just before bed with the lights down. Don’t forget right at the end of this absolutely terrible story, to remind them that they are not allowed to vote for a change of government until they turn 18. But they can register to vote to change matters they disapprove of as soon as they turn 17.\nYour children might react by telling you not to be so silly, close their eyes and sleep, much as so often happens when you read one of the ghastliest and grimmest of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nBut if they sit up and protest against your bedtime story, here is how to suggest that they run a poll at their school. Younger doubters may ask for another story: this can’t after all, be how it all ends? Maybe an Adventure is in order? Or a Game? Tomorrow night, then.\nChildren can always run a Poll\nAt their School, Club in the Family or anywhere where there are three or more people who can be persuaded to join in. They will need to appoint an Electoral Returning Officer to run a Poll or even an Internal Election. A boring school would appoint a teacher to this role. But this would avoid about two weeks work for a whole school who could Research, Discuss, Decide and Vote on making their own Elected Officer or Appointment (could be either) from within the class (for a class poll) or a school (for a school wide poll). They’d also need to Decide (and how to do that) whether or not they can Vote in an Assembly (like Parliament) or whether they need a full scale Election, in which case they would need to Design and Manufacture their own Poll Cards, Ballot Boxes and Confidential Polling Booths, Specify the Dates and Times the Booths would be open and then Decide how to Organise the Count: Appoint Polling Staff, Appoint Counting Staff. They’d also have to Decide on the Definition of the Electorate (or determine an Electoral Boundary) and whether or not they need to Register Eligible Voters on an Electoral Register. Oh yes, they’d have to Decide on a Wording to be put on the Ballot and whether or not more than one Vote can be taken and if so, how. And whether or not a Simple Majority is the best Voting Strategy.\nThey could each run a Vote Count to find out who or what Motion has won the Poll. Offences Detected and Offences Not Detected could also be counted, by each of the smaller teams.\nTo make this slightly less deadly (nobody is pretending all this is super exciting!) for older and very bright students, maybe those with lively imaginations and career options including Crime Writer, you could have one small additional group working in a Vote Fraud Team (their Objective could be to Manipulate the Vote by whatever Illegal Means they can Concoct) and another small additional group working as an Electoral Police, working to Detect Electoral Offences. This is not recommended for children under the age of 14, who generally adhere to the Right and Wrong Theory of Everything.\nParticipants who don’t understand the Capitalised Words (there are even a couple in this Post’s Heading!) will find them Defined in Wikipedia.\nCould two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nWell, Arguably they could. Because a teacher who asks a class to Vote FOR or AGAINST an idea by asking for a Show of Hands can run a Poll in about forty seconds flat. Although, of course, that hyper efficient teacher’s class may never grasp the finer points of how elections are run (and policed) by UK governments and UK law enforcement.\nThe monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nPark Ward votes against the trend\nPark Ward gifts Prime Minister Rishi Sunak half his morning after soundbites\nBy the morning after the election, it was already clear that the Conservatives were heading for an enormous number of local election defeats. For their Chairman “good” would have been keeping that number to just one thousand. They failed. And lost many more seats than that. The monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nBut, against this trend, in Park Ward two Conservatives were elected.\nThe result for Park Ward is interesting and in voting in two Conservatives, the ward went clean against the trend in the rest of the UK, which has so far (result in Redcar & Cleveland still to come in) seen the Conservatives net a loss of 1,058 seats.\nIn Park, Conservative candidate Arfan Khan came first and will serve the ward as city councillor for four years.\nConservative Muhammad Asif, on the other hand will serve a term of only one year, since by coming second, he won the seat vacated by ex Councillor Shaz Nawaz when he resigned, and whose term would have expired in 2024.\nMost people I canvassed were very keen not to see the Conservatives take Park. A huge number of people also know that it was a Conservative led council combined with many years of Conservative national governments which have brought the city to its current crisis, a council close to bankruptcy, many residents unable to provide themselves with food or heat indoors and as soon as you step outside the unmistakeable signs of neglect, deprivation and disempowerment are unavoidable.\nA Conservative win therefore baffles many people, including me, frankly. So what happened, how, and why?\nIs it a personal, rather than a party vote\nIn Arfan Khan’s case, his vote is a personal one and, I strongly suspect, nothing to do with which party he stood for.\nArfan Khan is an individual who commands great personal affection and respect in the community he serves as a funeral director.\nIs it a pragmatic, rather than a party vote\nThe Moslem community is currently trying to deal with issues at current burial sites and is keen to establish (a) new burial ground(s) in or near Peterborough and these campaigns will be more significant for many voters than any and all the goings on in Westminster.\nI can’t speak for or about Muhammad Asif, except to observe that, on the basis of his speech at the Park Ward hustings, he seems agreeable: mild and quietly spoken.\nWas Labour’s collapse more extreme in Park\nIn Park Ward, the resignation of the Labour Group Leader, ex Councillor Nawaz and the last minute resignation of ex Councillor Ikra Yasin prior to the elections will inevitably have damaged Labour’s chances in the ward, necessitating as they did, a last minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign. It is possible that the degree of Labour Party turbulence in Peterborough and especially in Park Ward is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Conventional wisdom would suggest that by this stage in the parliamentary electoral cycle, and with the current disgrace-inclined government, Labour should be able to wipe the board. Its supporters are angry that it isn’t taking opportunities when they are available. Labour could have taken control of Peterborough City Council, had it been allowed to work with other opposition councillors. As it is, Labour remains the hardest party to work with for the Greens (not just here), however helpful individual councillors might be.\nSo far, so good: these elements may be more or less peculiar to Park Ward. But I think most of the residents of the ward – and beyond – will still be bewildered that the Conservatives now hold two of the three city council seats representing residents in the ward. This is very clear in comments on Facebook.\nDefections to the Green Party\nBut the turmoil in Labour is worth returning to, since it has affected Peterborough’s Green election campaigns beyond Park Ward – and beyond Peterborough – too.\nPeterborough Greens (in common with Greens elsewhere in the country) have benefitted this year by the defections from Labour to our party of two excellent councillors. Bright Green published an article about this phenomenon. Unfortunately only one of ours (Cllr Heather Skibstead) succeeded in retaining her seat in Peterborough (which was Orton Longueville): she had more months and more of her own free time in which to communicate in advance of the election with her ward’s residents. However, her success represents a national first for the Green Party and we here as well as the party at large are delighted and very proud of this achievement.\nIt is really important for a political party to be able to manage post defection retention elections well. I’d like the Green Party to be a good place for good hard working conscientious councillors who’d much rather be with us, to defect to. Lots of councillors hang on in a political party they don’t really like, putting up with things they despise only because they know that being on your own and going independent is so risky. It makes sense that we work together to make it less risky to transfer a prior party allegiance to the Green Party. If you are reading this and are considering making such a step: please talk to us confidentially well in advance.\nWhen minus one equals plus one\nOddly, Heather’s retaining her seat counts as a GAIN for the Greens (even though as far as we were concerned, she was already a Green Party councillor), because the press compares the results of this with those of the previous election, which is guaranteed to confuse anyone not following things at this level of detail.\nThe second defector to our ranks this year was ex Cllr Imtiaz Ali. His arrival resulted in our biggest yet Green group of four on the council and I am sorry for him as well as for the group that he didn’t retain his Fletton & Woodston seat in this election. It would have been nearly if not impossible to win it, given the very short timescale available to his campaign.\nOnce again, despite losing Cllr Imtiaz Ali from our Green group on the council, Greens in Peterborough are reported in the media as having gained one councillor for the same confusing reasons. So despite gaining one, this picture on the council’s website on the day of the election, will soon reduce down to three councillors.\nBeyond all this excitement and a little further away in Orton Waterville, Councillor Nicola Day campaigned calmly and steadily to retain her seat and her campaign’s approach was rewarded with a huge margin of success, helping to entrench Orton Waterville’s reputation locally as an exceptionally well represented and very-happy-to-be-Green ward.\nThank you\nThis campaign has been truly extraordinary.\nThe achievement of Cllr Kirsty Knight in supporting members of another party getting used to Green ways of working cannot be overstated. This (as with many of her other roles) is not easy. Thank you Kirsty.\nIn this election our campaign teams have attempted more than ever before. Thank you for your votes. I have never received so many messages of support. I have never worked alongside so many volunteers and helpers. Our councillor team and our election team are quite simply, awesome. The reception candidates have received on doorsteps has been amazing and I feel that voters in Peterborough get us, at last. What we are, what we do, how we do it, and what we are capable of is just beginning to be understood. We are beginning to be seen, rather than described by outside hostile voices. The objectives we set ourselves are difficult and it is even more difficult to take people with us on these journeys, but I for one no longer feel I am on my own: there are people I have never met personally coming along beside me, who see me immediately they open their front door. I’d like to thank everyone who has appreciated us and lent us a hand during this campaign. We could not have achieved a fraction of what we have without such magnificent commitment and support. I hope you have enjoyed it and got something out of it as well. Thank you.\nreaders of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might explain the late declaration.\nThursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late.As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph. (Please note that the second and fourth articles have subsequently been updated.)\nThe third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am.\nWhy did huge Photo ID queues build up so late on election night?\nAs a candidate, my job on election night is to wait for the ballot box to come in and to be present at the count. This is how candidates respect the voter’s voice. The ballot box contains the ballots and on their ballot papers are the choices of voters, speaking and expressing their wishes on the one day they are allowed to vote. Candidates observe their counts. We see what they say.\nThe first of Park Ward’s ballot boxes (Madeley House polling station) came in in reasonable time. The second ballot box (All Saints polling station) came in very late indeed, apparently owing to a long queue building up due to the Photo ID check. Queue tickets were issued to those in the queue at 10pm. This was clearly not expected to be a big thing by polling staff, who, when I left them had already been on duty for thirteen and a half hours, with only on-site breaks. The third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am. I do not know how long polling staff had been at their posts by the time they were discharged from their duties, nor in what state they were. Polling staff are not permitted to leave the polling station while they are on duty and although they are all prepared for a 15 -16 hour shift, which is already an outrageously long working day, they certainly do not expect to be on duty very much beyond 10pm. I am wondering how many polling staff had to endure a 20 hour working day extending beyond Thursday 4th May into the early hours of the 5th.\nIt is true that PhotoID was trialled. But the very small trials were failures.\nUK government implemented the legislation despite the pilots’ failures.\nBallot boxes are normally handed over to the transport soon after 10pm and will usually arrive about an hour later. This year Peterborough City Council could not afford huge numbers of high security transit vehicles (the trucks looked like refrigerated container trucks) so some polling station staff at the eighty polling stations open at this year’s local election (there will be more polling stations for next year’s elections) will have had to wait for one of the five trucks waiting for a hold up somewhere else. I do not know how many polling stations were impacted by delays occurring in Park Ward. Nor do I know if other wards were themselves affected by late long queues.\nI cannot physically be in two places at once and all my team was already with me at the Town Hall. So, what I want to know is exactly what happened at the All Saints and St Georges polling stations. The advice I was given by polling staff was that the dinner time rush which usually starts between 5pm and 6pm was already dying down. Something clearly changed from the ward’s normal voting behaviour. How come? Why did such long queues form so late in the voting window?\nWere you in one of the queues? Please describe what happened.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements to cycling and walking routes.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.\nPostal ballots began to land on doormats only two days ago\nI’ve been standing at a great many front doors, ready to introduce myself when suddenly this week, there was no need: “Ah, so you’re Fiona. I’ve voted for you already.” The first time, it took my breath away. (Postal ballots only began to land on doormats two days ago!)\nThis can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they will get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues .\nheld in Park Ward on 16th April\nSome people were disappointed at the turnout at yesterday’s candidate hustings at the Willow Cafe in Park Ward, but top community activists tell me that “the people who turn up to things are the right people”.\nI was making a cup of tea this morning and it dawned on me that there had been a disproportionately high number of sustainable transport professionals in the room. That speaks to ongoing safety and speeding issues in Park Ward and it tallies with despair on the doorstep that the well understood underlying problems persist unfixed. In fact if we rearranged the chairs in the room, we probably had the skills right there in the room to fix the problem. What these experts don’t have (as things stand) is the council’s ear. Once again, it is often the case that the solutions are not somewhere else: we’ve likely got them right here, in Park Ward.\nCandidates on the ballot paper turned up, with the exception of the Labour and Reform candidates.\nAttending in the audience, were just the right number of loud voices. True, many people didn’t say anything, but, for whatever reason, they decided not to speak.\nIt was not a scary event. There were no fights and I did not spot intimidation. However, I took one concern expressed to the host at face value and will catch up with this (and them) as and when I can.\nI have come across electoral malpractices including intimidation which is a known (but I believe increasingly historic) problem in Park Ward and it is one of the reasons why CCTV cameras are frequently installed outside some or all of Park’s polling stations. I am aware of various pressures which have been applied over the years to voters in Park Ward (they tell me about shocking things going on in the past). Most of these pressures are “normal” family, social or party influences and feelings of obligation, which are part of normal life and a functioning democracy. But once a person feels they are being bullied, losing their right to choose freely or even having their vote stolen, voters and candidates shouldn’t hesitate to call the police or Electoral Services at the council (who can work out what the problem might be and will liaise with the police if necessary).\nJohn Peach in the middle of the room does not (in my book) constitute intimidation: his body language and his Cheshire Cat grin said louder than words how much enjoyed the event (announced on the 5th), despite failing to invite his online newsletter readers (emailed on the 8th) across the ward to it. Probably a communication problem rather than a deliberate omission.\nThere was disappointment expressed by a couple of people at the event’s format, which was cabaret layout for the audience and mingling for candidates, designed to facilitate more personal encounters. The room has a lovely but hard floor so for the hard of hearing one speaker at a time would work, whereas two voices would blur each other out. There was a very good (but also very well resourced) accessible hustings held during Peterborough’s parliamentary by-election in 2019.\nIt is worth pointing out that the traditional format (high table at the top for the candidates and seats for the public arranged as if for a theatre show – like BBC Question Time) does allow for the person who wants to ask a question to take the floor and, if they want to, to command the room. This can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues . It also allows for a bit of tit for tat between candidates and lets them demonstrate (and develop and practice) any debating skills they have: very likely to come in handy if elected.\nThe event was recorded by an unknown individual at the back who didn’t ask permission or make himself known to the host. I have no idea if the recording will go anywhere: but I doubt it. Shout if you spot it.\nNobody took names of attendees or pictures. It was probably the least “posed” hustings I’ve attended and that makes a pleasant change.\nSo, in summary all good. Thank you Park Streets Ahead for the invitation. And well done, Beki Sellick for doing very well the incredibly tough job of chairing.\nI got a great deal out of attending and personally enjoyed it very much. I learned many things, including that when the awesome Rosemary was elected the youngest ever female councillor in Scotland, her campaign had focussed on housing and the position of wardrobes in bedroom layouts. Presumably at a time of massive council house building. I shall have to catch up with her again to find out more. Something else on the list for after the election.\nIf you live in Park Ward and your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nI am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again.Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2015_05_29_wrong-side-of-the-road-in-peterborough/content_159.html": "The previous cycle route ran to the RIGHT of the vehicular one. (It was one of two city centre roads which require moving to the wrong side of the roads and was a top local knowledge quiz question.) It was used by cyclists to EXIT Long Causeway onto Broadway. During recent new surfacing work, inexplicably the old route has been blocked off by a new bit of fence.\nLong Causeway is one way for vehicles but two way for cyclists.\nNo entry signs at the EXIT of Long Causeway don’t make sense, even to car drivers, who wouldn’t see them, if they were driving in the right direction. The road is one way for cars, (isn’t it?) which would be coming towards you in this picture. The only vehicular exit is via Cathedral Square. Which is behind you.\nOnly council permitted vehicles are allowed in past the rising bollards. Although they are not currently working, it looks as if a new monitor has been installed.\nAn exit is required onto Broadway for cyclists. At the moment cyclists are cycling straight past the completely pointless no entry sign and over the potentially rising bollards.\nIs the council planning to\n- reinstate the previous cycle route and remove the fence? This would separate cars from bikes and leave a favourite quiz question intact.\n- remove the no entry signs?\n- add a cycling contraflow sign (as at the roundabout end of Cowgate)? But if it is going to do this will it explain how it intends to ensure cyclists aren’t accidentally impaled on a rising bollard they haven’t noticed?\nWe did have a Council Leader who wanted to abolish cycling in the whole city centre. He lost his seat in May.\nWhile he is gone, I for one am hoping the Council will be able to resolve this particular road sign nonsense quickly, sensibly and constructively. And if whoever is responsible for traffic signs in the city wants to comment below, he or she is very welcome.\nThere is hope. The view in the other direction makes a little bit more sense, (except for the temporary signage).",

Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.\nWhy is it proposed to build flats? I guess it is due to high demand for housing. Why is there a high demand for housing?

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_07_26_suspend-cllr-andy-coles/content_614.html": "Email sent to Cllr Holdich\nPlease Suspend Cllr Andy Coles!\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIf I was Jessica’s mum, what would I do?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nDemo for Andy Coles’ Resignation, Peterborough – Campaign …campaignopposingpolicesurveillance.com/event/demo-andy–coles…\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well.

I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\n- Jessica’s statement at the Police Spies Out of Lives and the PSOOL blog, 12 May 2017.\n- Paul Gravett, Andy Davey, the quiet spycop turned tory councillor an deputy police and crime commissioner, ARspycatcher, 12 May 2017.\n- Rob Evans, Cambridgeshire deputy police commissioner facing calls to resign over spy allegations, Guardian, 12 May 2017.\n- Simon Isreal, Police official under pressure to quit, Channel4 News, 12 May 2017.\nA biography is provided here: http://powerbase.info/index.php/Andy_Coles\nWhere the Met stands: re: previous similar but proved cases\nAll councillors inclined to agree with keeping Coles on their body should read this:\nhttp://news.met.police.uk/news/claimants-in-civil-cases-receive-mps-apology-138574\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\n— COPS (@copscampaign) July 25, 2017\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him. It is reasonable that he is suspended. It is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while these dreadful allegations remain unresolved.\nPeterborough Green Party supports the continued use of the Spectators Gallery as what it says on this notice:\nSpectators Gallery sign in Peterborough Town Hall showing the way up four flights of stairsand the door leading to it from Bridge Street. #OpenTheDoor (locked last Wednesday).\nPress Coverage of Coles’ resignation from his PCC role\nCambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy …www.edp24.co.uk/news/crime/cambridgeshire-s-deputy-police-and…\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned following allegations that he deceived … Cambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy Coles resigns.\nAndy Coles, Cambridgeshire’s deputy crime … – BBC Newswww.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-39920189\nThe allegation relates to Andy Coles‘ work as an undercover police officer in the 1990s. … Cambridgeshire’s deputy PCC resigns over ‘sex deceit’ claim.\nCambridgeshire deputy police commissioner resigns over spy …https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/15/cambridgeshire…\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned after being accused of deceiving a woman into a sexual relationship while he was an undercover officer.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_05_31_open-letter-pr/content_501.html": "There’s a Hole in your Logic\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nLet’s look at what Fiona Onasanya has had to say on electoral reform. A quick google search produces no comments on electoral reform (except where her name comes up alongside mine!). (Beki Sellick: very similar). As for Stewart Jackson: he has voted against electoral reform or been absent on every available occasion.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nGiven the maths, I don’t rate Labour’s chances in Peterborough at all. I don’t think Lisa Forbes thought she stood a hope either. There is only one candidate who could have swung it, in my opinion: the one who won) in the Peterborough area in the PCC election in 2012.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\nI hope this letter helps to minimise that risk.\nUseful links:\ntactical2017.com #Tactical2017\nTimeline:\n25/4/17 11:26 LAB 2015 candidate regrets she can’t stand in June 2017\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n29/4/17 12:50 UKIP announces it won’t field a candidate\n2/5/17 11:54 Greens announce their Peterborough (& NWC) selection results\n2/5/17 23:34 LAB reveal Fiona Onasanya is their Peterborough candidate\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess. It would be ridiculous, if it weren’t also dangerous.\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding non PCC residents from using “our” Household Recycling Facility!\nHave you lobbied your councillors on your preferences? Do you have enough information to have an opinion on where new unitary authority boundaries should lie? Do you know of a Peterborough event where this reorganisation will be considered?\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding Yaxley (Huntingdonshire District Council) and Whittlesey (Fenland District Council) residents from using their nearest (surely?) but “our” Household Recycling Facility!\na good budget requires highly effective team work\nThis meeting was live-streamed here. It began at 6pm.\nThe absence of ten councillors for the budget meeting is concerning. It is a high percentage. My very best wishes to Mayor Marco Cereste who has had a major health shock, and to his family. One councillor was legally prohibited from attending, pending a court appearance, but was able to ask a question from a remote location. I am very happy to live in a country where laws are respected and those who understand how best to implement them are able to do so. Hats off to officers for working to demonstrate a never before observed (by me, at any rate) example of inclusion.\nElected representatives who ABSTAIN on a budget might be expressing frustration or unhappiness, which, however genuinely felt, are emotions of no practical use to the residents they were elected to serve. Where the budget is concerned, it is irresponsible, because a good budget requires effective team work.\nThere is a point in voting AGAINST a budget. But to vote usefully AGAINST a budget, you must have done your homework and have another “alternative” budget up your sleeve. And you must also have the support of other elected representatives, so that you can be confident that it stands a chance of being supported if presented. In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work. You could then vote AGAINST the budget presented by the administration of the government (in this case a council) with a clean conscience, because you have built a better option. When the administration’s proposed budget falls to pass, you can then present your alternative budget. This might be just what the people who elected you need you to do.\nYou can see the breakdown of votes and who said what here.\nPeterborough’s unitary government in recent years has too often featured two sides sneering at each other’s ideas and policies and individuals not listening to good alternative policies simply because they originate from outside their own hard baked ideology (a classic example was the destruction of the local 20’s Plenty campaign, achieved by kicking a worthwhile project into the long grass of a “pilot project” and then those who kicked it never brought the results of that project back to council). Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets. The independent panel seems to have helped sort this out.\nHowever there is still some bad behaviour. During council meetings, councillors are frequently talking to their electorate in the council chamber and putting themselves onto social media. Councillor Nicola Day even took a team selfie during the meeting. Some appear to struggle to put their phone down and are constantly watching their phones while on a livestream. They embarrass Peterborough and its residents. It should be possible for councillors to switch their phones off during a meeting: it is professional to do so and it is simply good manners to give your full attention to the agenda and to your colleagues in a meeting.\nThe passage of the council’s budget on Wednesday was too tight for comfort, but compared with recent years, it was a welcome moment of calm organisation. I congratulate all those who worked constructively with Councillor Mohammed Jamil, Cabinet Member for Finance & Corporate Governance, whose approach has been consultative and consensual, to contribute to it and to vote for it. Hats off especially to Councillor Dennis Jones and to Councillor Wayne Fitzgerald. Without their closing speeches, their clarity and eloquence, this might not have passed and I strongly suspect that there was no superior alternative budget waiting in the wings. Passing any kind of workable budget in this era of badly managed economic decline (Westminster has never ended the “Austerity”) is nothing short of miraculous. I had high hopes for a new Labour government, but so far it has disappointed.\nWe have yet to see what happens as the independent supervisory panel finally walks away.\nThe council had leverage at that point. It needed to act when the residential developer was ready to rent or sell.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nfor me, it was a jaw on floor moment\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\n.. the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too ..\nAt 08:15 (once the programme ends) Just elected Paul Waugh MP (of all people!) describes, (as only a highly articulate, politically savvy and most importantly an experienced journalist could) what was going on there. I recognised his description as applicable to events in Peterborough. If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nSt Johns Church is holding a General Election Hustings\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nIs a bad portrait worse than no portrait at all?\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2024_04_19_address-to-voters-2/content_456.html": "Last year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nHowever, what I said last year about what needs doing in Park Ward has not changed. Park Ward still suffers from the same problems, so please re-read last year’s address. But this year I’m adding a couple of things:\nBin Lids – outside houses\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nBig Bins – outside flats and shops\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nHealth & Education services struggle with residents who move\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nResources for Roads\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.",

I gritted my teeth and started watching, expecting at best a bit of a civic heads up for me. It looked as if it was going to be grim.\nI used to go to the odd police panel (they preceded the introduction of the PCC) and here you can read my previous blogs about the new role of Police and Crime Commissioner and its disastrous roll out in Cambridgeshire (the quality of candidates selected for election by the Conservatives has been terrible). Sitting through meetings (whether they are community based panels or the meet-the-latest-commissioner-in-the-town-hall type) does give you some insight into what issues the police face and how their priorities are decided.

He was responding to ‘the Mayor‘s review’ or, to give it its full name, ‘The review into Operation Span and the investigation of non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’ which has just been published. The next speaker was Rochdale Council leader Councillor Neil Emmott, the leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, who also apologised for what the council had got wrong.\nNext came three women, each of whom had headed up an organisation working with the thousands of (mostly female and very young) victims of human trafficking and sexual abuse. (nobody’s names came up from start to finish). The first woman had been through the barrier known as the end of one’s tether, her hair got in her way, and she was gasping for air and needed water, but she was clearly a warrior and won my respect for getting out in short order the horrible truths she needed to speak.\nThe second woman was wearing a very smart cream dress and had her hair and make up done: full Manchester female in armour, elegantly equipped equally for the dance floor, lifting someone up out of the gutter, or take her presentation to any board room or civic assembly rooms of the city prepared to listen to what goes on in the darkest corners of the city: where corruption, physical, emotional and psychological abuse and the systemic collusion of letting offenders go: the institutional joint enterprise (how come that is not an offence, she asks?) of deliberately letting known and identified criminals walk free.\nShe struck a line through the whole of the older Oldham predecessor report, revealing that during that investigation, only one victim had been able to speak to the reviewers. It’s people like her I want to see working where they can do what is needed: in the House of Lords.\nThen, just as the third woman, in a dark suit began speaking, she was rudely interrupted by a far more important man: Grant Schapps, talking about the state of the world and threats had multiplied and increased in severity during the horrible reign of his own ghastly Tory Party. I have no idea what the third woman wanted to say.\nHow dare the BBC cut this third woman short? They had three channels they could have used. BBC1, BBC2 and BBCNews. The handling of this press release was outrageous. Instead 10 Downing St was able to shut up a woman speaking on matters of concern to every woman and child and every decent man in the UK.\nI think I might have to complain to the BBC. Three news channels.\nWhat happened to the third woman’s voice, please?\nCan anyone figure out where the broadcast continued?\nWho has broadcast what she said, please?\nMeanwhile, I search for Rochdale report on Youtube and, depressingly, I find:\nThe Nene is in flood, still transporting last summer and autumn’s above average rainfall to the Wash and new steadily heavy El Niño winter rain. Since my third update the Conservative administration at Peterborough City Council has been toppled and a well intentioned but inexperienced ex opposition multi party Cabinet is trying to keep the council’s finances afloat and to fix whatever has been going wrong. The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?\nHow to get Santa back when his arrival down your chimney is threatened by UK Government Diktat. Could two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nAll children need to be told about this appalling story broken by Newsthump. Sit them down after they’ve had a good meal and read it as gently and softly as you can. Just before bed with the lights down. Don’t forget right at the end of this absolutely terrible story, to remind them that they are not allowed to vote for a change of government until they turn 18. But they can register to vote to change matters they disapprove of as soon as they turn 17.\nYour children might react by telling you not to be so silly, close their eyes and sleep, much as so often happens when you read one of the ghastliest and grimmest of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nBut if they sit up and protest against your bedtime story, here is how to suggest that they run a poll at their school. Younger doubters may ask for another story: this can’t after all, be how it all ends? Maybe an Adventure is in order? Or a Game? Tomorrow night, then.\nChildren can always run a Poll\nAt their School, Club in the Family or anywhere where there are three or more people who can be persuaded to join in. They will need to appoint an Electoral Returning Officer to run a Poll or even an Internal Election. A boring school would appoint a teacher to this role. But this would avoid about two weeks work for a whole school who could Research, Discuss, Decide and Vote on making their own Elected Officer or Appointment (could be either) from within the class (for a class poll) or a school (for a school wide poll). They’d also need to Decide (and how to do that) whether or not they can Vote in an Assembly (like Parliament) or whether they need a full scale Election, in which case they would need to Design and Manufacture their own Poll Cards, Ballot Boxes and Confidential Polling Booths, Specify the Dates and Times the Booths would be open and then Decide how to Organise the Count: Appoint Polling Staff, Appoint Counting Staff. They’d also have to Decide on the Definition of the Electorate (or determine an Electoral Boundary) and whether or not they need to Register Eligible Voters on an Electoral Register. Oh yes, they’d have to Decide on a Wording to be put on the Ballot and whether or not more than one Vote can be taken and if so, how. And whether or not a Simple Majority is the best Voting Strategy.\nThey could each run a Vote Count to find out who or what Motion has won the Poll. Offences Detected and Offences Not Detected could also be counted, by each of the smaller teams.\nTo make this slightly less deadly (nobody is pretending all this is super exciting!) for older and very bright students, maybe those with lively imaginations and career options including Crime Writer, you could have one small additional group working in a Vote Fraud Team (their Objective could be to Manipulate the Vote by whatever Illegal Means they can Concoct) and another small additional group working as an Electoral Police, working to Detect Electoral Offences. This is not recommended for children under the age of 14, who generally adhere to the Right and Wrong Theory of Everything.\nParticipants who don’t understand the Capitalised Words (there are even a couple in this Post’s Heading!) will find them Defined in Wikipedia.\nCould two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nWell, Arguably they could. Because a teacher who asks a class to Vote FOR or AGAINST an idea by asking for a Show of Hands can run a Poll in about forty seconds flat. Although, of course, that hyper efficient teacher’s class may never grasp the finer points of how elections are run (and policed) by UK governments and UK law enforcement.\nThe monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nPark Ward votes against the trend\nPark Ward gifts Prime Minister Rishi Sunak half his morning after soundbites\nBy the morning after the election, it was already clear that the Conservatives were heading for an enormous number of local election defeats. For their Chairman “good” would have been keeping that number to just one thousand. They failed. And lost many more seats than that. The monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nBut, against this trend, in Park Ward two Conservatives were elected.\nThe result for Park Ward is interesting and in voting in two Conservatives, the ward went clean against the trend in the rest of the UK, which has so far (result in Redcar & Cleveland still to come in) seen the Conservatives net a loss of 1,058 seats.\nIn Park, Conservative candidate Arfan Khan came first and will serve the ward as city councillor for four years.\nConservative Muhammad Asif, on the other hand will serve a term of only one year, since by coming second, he won the seat vacated by ex Councillor Shaz Nawaz when he resigned, and whose term would have expired in 2024.\nMost people I canvassed were very keen not to see the Conservatives take Park. A huge number of people also know that it was a Conservative led council combined with many years of Conservative national governments which have brought the city to its current crisis, a council close to bankruptcy, many residents unable to provide themselves with food or heat indoors and as soon as you step outside the unmistakeable signs of neglect, deprivation and disempowerment are unavoidable.\nA Conservative win therefore baffles many people, including me, frankly. So what happened, how, and why?\nIs it a personal, rather than a party vote\nIn Arfan Khan’s case, his vote is a personal one and, I strongly suspect, nothing to do with which party he stood for.\nArfan Khan is an individual who commands great personal affection and respect in the community he serves as a funeral director.\nIs it a pragmatic, rather than a party vote\nThe Moslem community is currently trying to deal with issues at current burial sites and is keen to establish (a) new burial ground(s) in or near Peterborough and these campaigns will be more significant for many voters than any and all the goings on in Westminster.\nI can’t speak for or about Muhammad Asif, except to observe that, on the basis of his speech at the Park Ward hustings, he seems agreeable: mild and quietly spoken.\nWas Labour’s collapse more extreme in Park\nIn Park Ward, the resignation of the Labour Group Leader, ex Councillor Nawaz and the last minute resignation of ex Councillor Ikra Yasin prior to the elections will inevitably have damaged Labour’s chances in the ward, necessitating as they did, a last minute and ultimately unsuccessful campaign. It is possible that the degree of Labour Party turbulence in Peterborough and especially in Park Ward is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Conventional wisdom would suggest that by this stage in the parliamentary electoral cycle, and with the current disgrace-inclined government, Labour should be able to wipe the board. Its supporters are angry that it isn’t taking opportunities when they are available. Labour could have taken control of Peterborough City Council, had it been allowed to work with other opposition councillors. As it is, Labour remains the hardest party to work with for the Greens (not just here), however helpful individual councillors might be.\nSo far, so good: these elements may be more or less peculiar to Park Ward. But I think most of the residents of the ward – and beyond – will still be bewildered that the Conservatives now hold two of the three city council seats representing residents in the ward. This is very clear in comments on Facebook.\nDefections to the Green Party\nBut the turmoil in Labour is worth returning to, since it has affected Peterborough’s Green election campaigns beyond Park Ward – and beyond Peterborough – too.\nPeterborough Greens (in common with Greens elsewhere in the country) have benefitted this year by the defections from Labour to our party of two excellent councillors. Bright Green published an article about this phenomenon. Unfortunately only one of ours (Cllr Heather Skibstead) succeeded in retaining her seat in Peterborough (which was Orton Longueville): she had more months and more of her own free time in which to communicate in advance of the election with her ward’s residents. However, her success represents a national first for the Green Party and we here as well as the party at large are delighted and very proud of this achievement.\nIt is really important for a political party to be able to manage post defection retention elections well. I’d like the Green Party to be a good place for good hard working conscientious councillors who’d much rather be with us, to defect to. Lots of councillors hang on in a political party they don’t really like, putting up with things they despise only because they know that being on your own and going independent is so risky. It makes sense that we work together to make it less risky to transfer a prior party allegiance to the Green Party. If you are reading this and are considering making such a step: please talk to us confidentially well in advance.\nWhen minus one equals plus one\nOddly, Heather’s retaining her seat counts as a GAIN for the Greens (even though as far as we were concerned, she was already a Green Party councillor), because the press compares the results of this with those of the previous election, which is guaranteed to confuse anyone not following things at this level of detail.\nThe second defector to our ranks this year was ex Cllr Imtiaz Ali. His arrival resulted in our biggest yet Green group of four on the council and I am sorry for him as well as for the group that he didn’t retain his Fletton & Woodston seat in this election. It would have been nearly if not impossible to win it, given the very short timescale available to his campaign.\nOnce again, despite losing Cllr Imtiaz Ali from our Green group on the council, Greens in Peterborough are reported in the media as having gained one councillor for the same confusing reasons. So despite gaining one, this picture on the council’s website on the day of the election, will soon reduce down to three councillors.\nBeyond all this excitement and a little further away in Orton Waterville, Councillor Nicola Day campaigned calmly and steadily to retain her seat and her campaign’s approach was rewarded with a huge margin of success, helping to entrench Orton Waterville’s reputation locally as an exceptionally well represented and very-happy-to-be-Green ward.\nThank you\nThis campaign has been truly extraordinary.\nThe achievement of Cllr Kirsty Knight in supporting members of another party getting used to Green ways of working cannot be overstated. This (as with many of her other roles) is not easy. Thank you Kirsty.\nIn this election our campaign teams have attempted more than ever before. Thank you for your votes. I have never received so many messages of support. I have never worked alongside so many volunteers and helpers. Our councillor team and our election team are quite simply, awesome. The reception candidates have received on doorsteps has been amazing and I feel that voters in Peterborough get us, at last. What we are, what we do, how we do it, and what we are capable of is just beginning to be understood. We are beginning to be seen, rather than described by outside hostile voices. The objectives we set ourselves are difficult and it is even more difficult to take people with us on these journeys, but I for one no longer feel I am on my own: there are people I have never met personally coming along beside me, who see me immediately they open their front door. I’d like to thank everyone who has appreciated us and lent us a hand during this campaign. We could not have achieved a fraction of what we have without such magnificent commitment and support. I hope you have enjoyed it and got something out of it as well. Thank you.\nreaders of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might explain the late declaration.\nThursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late.As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph. (Please note that the second and fourth articles have subsequently been updated.)\nThe third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am.\nWhy did huge Photo ID queues build up so late on election night?\nAs a candidate, my job on election night is to wait for the ballot box to come in and to be present at the count. This is how candidates respect the voter’s voice. The ballot box contains the ballots and on their ballot papers are the choices of voters, speaking and expressing their wishes on the one day they are allowed to vote. Candidates observe their counts. We see what they say.\nThe first of Park Ward’s ballot boxes (Madeley House polling station) came in in reasonable time. The second ballot box (All Saints polling station) came in very late indeed, apparently owing to a long queue building up due to the Photo ID check. Queue tickets were issued to those in the queue at 10pm. This was clearly not expected to be a big thing by polling staff, who, when I left them had already been on duty for thirteen and a half hours, with only on-site breaks. The third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am. I do not know how long polling staff had been at their posts by the time they were discharged from their duties, nor in what state they were. Polling staff are not permitted to leave the polling station while they are on duty and although they are all prepared for a 15 -16 hour shift, which is already an outrageously long working day, they certainly do not expect to be on duty very much beyond 10pm. I am wondering how many polling staff had to endure a 20 hour working day extending beyond Thursday 4th May into the early hours of the 5th.\nIt is true that PhotoID was trialled. But the very small trials were failures.\nUK government implemented the legislation despite the pilots’ failures.\nBallot boxes are normally handed over to the transport soon after 10pm and will usually arrive about an hour later. This year Peterborough City Council could not afford huge numbers of high security transit vehicles (the trucks looked like refrigerated container trucks) so some polling station staff at the eighty polling stations open at this year’s local election (there will be more polling stations for next year’s elections) will have had to wait for one of the five trucks waiting for a hold up somewhere else. I do not know how many polling stations were impacted by delays occurring in Park Ward. Nor do I know if other wards were themselves affected by late long queues.\nI cannot physically be in two places at once and all my team was already with me at the Town Hall. So, what I want to know is exactly what happened at the All Saints and St Georges polling stations. The advice I was given by polling staff was that the dinner time rush which usually starts between 5pm and 6pm was already dying down. Something clearly changed from the ward’s normal voting behaviour. How come? Why did such long queues form so late in the voting window?\nWere you in one of the queues? Please describe what happened.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements to cycling and walking routes.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2019_05_30_video-mystery-1/content_201.html": "I don’t remember dreaming last night. I often dream. But last night I slept that dark recovery sleep which comes night after night when you have been sleep deprived for a long time. Like Guinness. Dark and deep. No images. But something important got stitched together in the night. As I swung out of bed I knew exactly why I had got so cross yesterday about the livestream being cancelled during the hustings at the St Johns Hustings on Tuesday. Anger is never a good thing, but it is the most important directional kick and motivator available. Incredibly powerful. Understanding it and reflecting on it matters: I always try to do that. I was puzzling about my feelings when I went to bed. But it took a whole night’s sleep to alert me to what had made me incandescent with fury yesterday.\nI’d been looking in the wrong place for the answer.\nLast night’s sleep brought me back to another painful memory. I am very aware of other candidates’ emotions: I’ve been upset several times. The way candidates are treated is very important. One party leader at the Tuesday railed against his candidate’s exclusion from the platform. I couldn’t help but sympathise. Candidates need so much support and help in doing what they try to do. It is impossible not to see the hurt and pain which they encounter on the way. During the night two memories of anger and a feeling of me personally being badly let down connected themselves together. I’d been reflecting on yet another occasion (yes standing for election is full of drama and high emotion!), but of course: it wasn’t that occasion which mattered.\nNearly the same thing happened before. Of course it did. I was told years ago at another hustings that a professional recording would be made and that it would be broadcast but it never was. My performance on the platform was pretty awful. But the broken promise was what mattered to and hurt me.\nThat’s why I was nearly incoherent yesterday on Twitter. Do go and have a look. https://twitter.com/FionaRadic\nThis morning I am calm. I realise this is a rerun of what has happened before. There is a pattern. The murderer of tracks may have struck before.\nThe trouble with getting upset about things is that you can’t always confront the actual problem so you embalm it in a better buried place in your consciousness in order to “move on”. This is especially true if you are a directly affected and traumatised candidate. But as it happens, this week I have a huge advantage. I am not the candidate. True I am in recovery from having been the candidate in two very exciting and over close together elections. But I am deliciously and delightfully free of the specific challenges which every candidates faces: including having to put a lot of very important things on one side in order to deal with the urgent things. And I can sleep. I am looking after another candidate. But I am not him. I can reflect. I can think. Bliss.\nA high level of disappointment between what was promised at an event and what is delivered is why I now go equipped with a camera and even a crew if I can assemble one and try to report on the event as well as perform (when I am a candidate) at a hustings. Of course this is entirely because it has happened before. My behaviour is totally conditioned by the occasion which sleep brought back to me. I’d somehow excluded it from my thoughts yesterday even though it was the causative event of my current behaviour. You can only know what it is like to do both jobs if you’ve done it. Candidates shouldn’t need to perform as candidates and as reporter. Multiple reasons why not, including obvious bias.\nIt isn’t an accident that I’ve never been elected. For me that is never, has never been the most important thing. A functioning democracy is far more important to me. I was aware when I started my blog things didn’t work properly in Peterborough.\nWell here’s a very important example of things going utterly wrong. If you have an election, voters need to see the candidates as soon as possible so that they can make as good a decision as they possibly can.\nAnything which supports that process is contributing to the workings of democracy. Huge numbers of people not directly involved in the party political processes help the democratic process to work as well as it can. They often don’t get a thank you. The vast majority get absolutely nothing in return. We need more of them and they need to be supported and feel far more empowered.\nAnything or anyone which obstructs that needs to be identified and exposed.\nNobody and nothing should have had the power to murder the livestream on Tuesday. The host of an event is in charge and a candidate at a public event is in a public place. So how was that even possible?\nSo today I’ve decided to stop yelling frantically on twitter, get out the meditative garden fork which is my blog and ask people what they can tell me about these recordings and who stops them being broadcast and why. And if they are used, who uses them. Comments are open if you can talk openly (you can comment anonymously too).

It met to decide whether or not to call-in the decision made by Deputy Leader Councillor Matthew Lee (CONSERVATIVE) to make Viridor the preferred bidder to run the council’s planned incinerator (Lot 1).\nThe members of this committee are:\n- Councillor Marion Todd (Chairman)\n- Councillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman)\n- Councillor Mohammed Nadeem\n- Councillor Yasmeen Maqbool\n- Councillor Stuart Martin\n- Councillor Nick Thulbourn\n- Councillor Judy Fox\n- Councillor Dale McKean (Reserve)\n- Councillor Lisa Forbes (Reserve)\n- Councillor Chris Ash (Reserve) (source: Peterborough City Council)\nCllr Maqbool had given advance notice of her absence and Cllr Dale McKean attended in her place.\nAt the end of about four hours of lengthy, soporific, off topic but occasionally revelatory proceedings the committee decided 4 to 3 to reject the request for a call-in.\nVoted AGAINST calling in the decision (and therefore supporting Cllr Lee’s decision)\nCouncillor Marion Todd (Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Mohammed Nadeem CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Dale McKean (Reserve) CONSERVATIVE\nVoted FOR calling in the decision (and supporting reference back to Full Council or decision maker, but unable to vote for either option since the other vote took place first)\nCouncillor Stuart Martin LABOUR\nCouncillor Nick Thulbourn LABOUR\nCouncillor Judy Fox INDEPENDENT\nThe meeting began at 6pm with Apologies and Declaration of Interests. No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.",

Democratic deficiencies open up cracks and we have crises of trust. So while people feel that they are being exposed to economic, climatic and political threats, voters are furious that their wishes as expressed at the ballot box are disregarded when they can see that politicians have no choice but to work together and across party lines.”\nFiona Radic stood for parliament in 2010 and celebrated a decade of campaigning with the Green Party by standing again in 2017’s snap election. She helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which Julie Howell kept her deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proving strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. Julie Howell was subsequently elected to the city council in 2018 as Peterborough’s first Green city councillor.\nFiona campaigned to remain in the EU during the referendum and previously stood for election in East Region to the European Parliament in 2014.\n“My family is international in its connections and outlook. The EU referendum was divisive and profoundly destructive. It caused alarm and dismay at a time of unprecedented international economic stress and political upheaval. I stand firmly with those whose rights and relationships – personal and business – are being overlooked by the state. People are not bargaining chips. It isn’t acceptable for politicians to play to the gallery by discarding peoples’ hard won rights. It is one thing for the state to assert its right to govern itself (even if that right was never endangered). It is entirely another to put our current economic system at risk, and to threaten family life. And not just family life. Businesses are also being rocked by incompetent and self interested styles of government. If we are to leave the EU, let us be sure to make that a sensible and constructive process and make full use of Green Party thinking on local decision making and empowerment. But I am now absolutely sure that the decision about leaving the EU was founded on shoddy information and that those in power will have to give voters a sensible and fully informed choice. Of course voters will be cross: they are entitled to be furious. But fake news, anger and fear are not sound bases for complicated and difficult decisions and those who whipped it up should be ashamed of themselves and I hope that in this extraordinary European election which nobody thought would happen, that voters will hold them accountable by casting their vote for the Green Party.”\nFiona has campaigned on the NHS, on transport, planning and infrastructure, on nuclear power and Trident, air quality, green spaces, social justice and equality, maternity services and housing.

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_02_27_palmer-apology/content_135.html": "Palmer Admits Government has Failed our Area\nJames Palmer is the Conservative candidate expecting to be crowned Mayor of the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on May 4th. Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nFirstly, Peterborough is BIGGER than Cambridge.\nI occasionally make just this point and people look at me as if I was mad. But yes it has been for a while and it still is. I’ve just double checked last census data available on Wikipedia:\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarked gets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn order to make something perfectly clear to your colleagues in a democratic forum it is a legal requirement to declare your interests. It is a criminal offence not to, if it happens to be a pecuniary interest. For some obscure reason, this requirement appears not to have been applied (at least by means of a publicly accessible document) by our Local Enterprise Partnership, until the MP complained. The Register is now available online and forms part of a section on Corporate Governance.\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nMeanwhile I’d love to know what you think.\nAnd if you happen to live in Chatteris or in Wisbech, I hope you vote for Julie too!\nFiona, the whole Cambs and Pbo devo deal is distinctly dodgy. We are being forced to accept second best because Gillian wants to stay as CEO of both Pbo city and Cambs county!!!!\nLikeLike",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_06_13_watching-the-grass-grow-in-peterborough/content_8.html": "A grassy walk in Peterborough Social media lit up in Peterborough last week and the topic was grass on a recreation field which had grown to one metre tall. So on Wednesday when Sue said shall we go for a walk in the Boardwalks? I thought: I really need to switch off and there could be some grass there! And indeed: lots of different kinds of grasses, with seed heads blowing about in the wind. You can watch the dance of the seed heads as the wind makes huge ripples across the meadow. This is the entrance to the boardwalks, I am wondering how high this grass is and how much is reeds and sedges and which is which. I don’t know my grasses. Recent very heavy rain has damaged the boardwalk, which was built in the 80s. This marshy area is a tiny patch of an important flood plain for the river Nene. By absorbing and retaining river and rainwater upstream soft squidgy places like this help to protect the city. Fit people can cross the boardwalk here, but please be very very careful. Might be three quarters of a pint of water in there with all sorts floating in it. Lovely fuzzy teasels. Here we say goodbye to the Boardwalk. A large grey heron with wings spread out, presumably to dry. Looks like a weird sculpture from a distance. I was just about to get the perfect shot from much closer up, but pushing our bikes along, we startled it, and off it went. (We’d cycled to get to the boardwalks and were now back on our bikes.). Found this not so delightful plant very close to the city centre. This is Japanese Knotweed. It is on the verge of Henry Penn walk, north Nene embankment. I have emailed the council and Railworld to find out who this patch of land belongs to: I am guessing it belongs to the council.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_08_30_mini-sit-in-at-call-in/content_383.html": "Last night the committee with a very long name about which I have blogged previously met again, this time to consider a Call-In Request. It met to decide whether or not to call-in the decision made by Deputy Leader Councillor Matthew Lee (CONSERVATIVE) to make Viridor the preferred bidder to run the council’s planned incinerator (Lot 1).\nThe members of this committee are:\n- Councillor Marion Todd (Chairman)\n- Councillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman)\n- Councillor Mohammed Nadeem\n- Councillor Yasmeen Maqbool\n- Councillor Stuart Martin\n- Councillor Nick Thulbourn\n- Councillor Judy Fox\n- Councillor Dale McKean (Reserve)\n- Councillor Lisa Forbes (Reserve)\n- Councillor Chris Ash (Reserve) (source: Peterborough City Council)\nCllr Maqbool had given advance notice of her absence and Cllr Dale McKean attended in her place.\nAt the end of about four hours of lengthy, soporific, off topic but occasionally revelatory proceedings the committee decided 4 to 3 to reject the request for a call-in.\nVoted AGAINST calling in the decision (and therefore supporting Cllr Lee’s decision)\nCouncillor Marion Todd (Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Mohammed Nadeem CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Dale McKean (Reserve) CONSERVATIVE\nVoted FOR calling in the decision (and supporting reference back to Full Council or decision maker, but unable to vote for either option since the other vote took place first)\nCouncillor Stuart Martin LABOUR\nCouncillor Nick Thulbourn LABOUR\nCouncillor Judy Fox INDEPENDENT\nThe meeting began at 6pm with Apologies and Declaration of Interests. No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_06_27_2nd-eu-referendum-petition-brings-two-sides-together/content_706.html": "After I posted my comments on why people might be sharing the 2nd EU Referendum petition, I had a day out: trying to do something other than reflect on the nightmare of the Leave vote, which was totally impossible.\nWhile out I learned that the police or the government (depending which story you read) were investigating a possible fraud to do with the people who had signed the petition: some of whom didn’t live in the UK and some of whom were apparently surplus to the entire populations of whole countries, so presumably might consist only of an email address. 77,000 false signatures had apparently been removed. Variations on this tale are numerous but you have to go to twitter for a laugh.\nIncidentally isn’t it wonderful that a Leave petition is being so enthusiastically embraced by the Remain side? Perhaps the petitions office should have let the No Confidence in David Cameron petition get a debate? Looking back, it might have been an easier way for him to leave office and the office might not have been left in quite such an appalling mess.",

And since I wrote about a jargon-prone subject which most people would find technical, difficult and tedious an over speedy response really wouldn’t impress me.\nBut offering an apology for responding within a week achieves so much.

That would be impolite: he has expressed himself to me honestly, frankly and (absolutely critically important to me, and to anything relating to planning) he comes over as open-minded and prepared to listen. That is what I think people expect of a ward councillor.\nAnd, best of all, from what he says I can see that he has done his homework and understands the incinerator campaign work which has being quietly going on in the city.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_nappy/content_239.html": "Yesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.",

For their Chairman “good” would have been keeping that number to just one thousand. They failed. And lost many more seats than that. The monstrous cost of Conservative policies landed almost as heavily on their councillors as it has been landing on the great British public.\nBut, against this trend, in Park Ward two Conservatives were elected.\nThe result for Park Ward is interesting and in voting in two Conservatives, the ward went clean against the trend in the rest of the UK, which has so far (result in Redcar & Cleveland still to come in) seen the Conservatives net a loss of 1,058 seats.\nIn Park, Conservative candidate Arfan Khan came first and will serve the ward as city councillor for four years.\nConservative Muhammad Asif, on the other hand will serve a term of only one year, since by coming second, he won the seat vacated by ex Councillor Shaz Nawaz when he resigned, and whose term would have expired in 2024.\nMost people I canvassed were very keen not to see the Conservatives take Park. A huge number of people also know that it was a Conservative led council combined with many years of Conservative national governments which have brought the city to its current crisis, a council close to bankruptcy, many residents unable to provide themselves with food or heat indoors and as soon as you step outside the unmistakeable signs of neglect, deprivation and disempowerment are unavoidable.\nA Conservative win therefore baffles many people, including me, frankly.

It is possible that the degree of Labour Party turbulence in Peterborough and especially in Park Ward is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Conventional wisdom would suggest that by this stage in the parliamentary electoral cycle, and with the current disgrace-inclined government, Labour should be able to wipe the board. Its supporters are angry that it isn’t taking opportunities when they are available. Labour could have taken control of Peterborough City Council, had it been allowed to work with other opposition councillors. As it is, Labour remains the hardest party to work with for the Greens (not just here), however helpful individual councillors might be.\nSo far, so good: these elements may be more or less peculiar to Park Ward. But I think most of the residents of the ward – and beyond – will still be bewildered that the Conservatives now hold two of the three city council seats representing residents in the ward. This is very clear in comments on Facebook.\nDefections to the Green Party\nBut the turmoil in Labour is worth returning to, since it has affected Peterborough’s Green election campaigns beyond Park Ward – and beyond Peterborough – too.\nPeterborough Greens (in common with Greens elsewhere in the country) have benefitted this year by the defections from Labour to our party of two excellent councillors. Bright Green published an article about this phenomenon. Unfortunately only one of ours (Cllr Heather Skibstead) succeeded in retaining her seat in Peterborough (which was Orton Longueville): she had more months and more of her own free time in which to communicate in advance of the election with her ward’s residents. However, her success represents a national first for the Green Party and we here as well as the party at large are delighted and very proud of this achievement.\nIt is really important for a political party to be able to manage post defection retention elections well. I’d like the Green Party to be a good place for good hard working conscientious councillors who’d much rather be with us, to defect to. Lots of councillors hang on in a political party they don’t really like, putting up with things they despise only because they know that being on your own and going independent is so risky. It makes sense that we work together to make it less risky to transfer a prior party allegiance to the Green Party. If you are reading this and are considering making such a step: please talk to us confidentially well in advance.\nWhen minus one equals plus one\nOddly, Heather’s retaining her seat counts as a GAIN for the Greens (even though as far as we were concerned, she was already a Green Party councillor), because the press compares the results of this with those of the previous election, which is guaranteed to confuse anyone not following things at this level of detail.\nThe second defector to our ranks this year was ex Cllr Imtiaz Ali. His arrival resulted in our biggest yet Green group of four on the council and I am sorry for him as well as for the group that he didn’t retain his Fletton & Woodston seat in this election. It would have been nearly if not impossible to win it, given the very short timescale available to his campaign.\nOnce again, despite losing Cllr Imtiaz Ali from our Green group on the council, Greens in Peterborough are reported in the media as having gained one councillor for the same confusing reasons. So despite gaining one, this picture on the council’s website on the day of the election, will soon reduce down to three councillors.\nBeyond all this excitement and a little further away in Orton Waterville, Councillor Nicola Day campaigned calmly and steadily to retain her seat and her campaign’s approach was rewarded with a huge margin of success, helping to entrench Orton Waterville’s reputation locally as an exceptionally well represented and very-happy-to-be-Green ward.\nThank you\nThis campaign has been truly extraordinary.\nThe achievement of Cllr Kirsty Knight in supporting members of another party getting used to Green ways of working cannot be overstated. This (as with many of her other roles) is not easy. Thank you Kirsty.\nIn this election our campaign teams have attempted more than ever before. Thank you for your votes. I have never received so many messages of support. I have never worked alongside so many volunteers and helpers. Our councillor team and our election team are quite simply, awesome. The reception candidates have received on doorsteps has been amazing and I feel that voters in Peterborough get us, at last. What we are, what we do, how we do it, and what we are capable of is just beginning to be understood. We are beginning to be seen, rather than described by outside hostile voices. The objectives we set ourselves are difficult and it is even more difficult to take people with us on these journeys, but I for one no longer feel I am on my own: there are people I have never met personally coming along beside me, who see me immediately they open their front door. I’d like to thank everyone who has appreciated us and lent us a hand during this campaign. We could not have achieved a fraction of what we have without such magnificent commitment and support. I hope you have enjoyed it and got something out of it as well. Thank you.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_environmental-health-officer/content_648.html": "On Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_05_07_my-bank-holiday-a-filthy-fire/content_577.html": "My intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough. What do you think?\nMeanwhile thank you to Blue Watch at Dogsthorpe Fire Station for helping today!\n2 thoughts on “My bank holiday & a filthy fire”",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_02_02_how-i-wonder-how-you-park/content_451.html": "On the 21st April 2015 a hustings was held in All Saints Church Hall, Park Road Peterborough. This is a rare thing in Peterborough: a ward hustings. As far as I am aware Park Ward is the only ward in the unitary authority of Peterborough which holds a regular hustings events. Here, voters are invited, either by the residents’ associations or by whoever leaflets the ward. Park Ward has begun to view them as an important part of the run up to election day. I am a big fan of hustings, as a glimpse at my blog will confirm. I’d like to see several in every ward, since they give people chances to thrash out where candidates stand on different issues, and how they perform, and what they are like.\nAnyway every candidate appearing on the ballot paper in May had been invited to the Church Hall by a local residents’ association and the turnout was small, but respectable and well informed. John Peach, CON, was the last candidate to arrive. I would probably have been taking my seat and organising bits of paper when there was the very slightest flutter of excitement in the audience. The hustings proceeded without incident.\nOne of the most true and telling observations of the 2015 election campaign was made by a man at the back of the audience. He pointed out that climate change had disappeared from all the parties’ election campaigns.\nAfter the event someone else came up to me and asked me to accompany him into the car park to see how John Peach had parked his car. He claimed to have felt an impact, but I am pretty sure his tongue was in his cheek and I have to say the wall did not move for me. But naturally I had a look. And of course I took a photo.\nI couldn’t see the wall behind the rear bumper at all. Can you?\nI realised that had there been the sort of penetrative event you see in a crazy American road movie, instead of talking to a man in a car park, I might have seen a man flying across my field of vision and just for a second I imagined him fly, hanging on to his church hall chair as a massive black car skidded across the parquet floor in a hail of bricks and plaster dust. But that was just me imagining something which certainly did not happen that evening. Thank goodness.\nWhat I did observe is that Cllr John Peach, (who was reelected and has since been crowned Mayor of our fair city) had proved himself capable of parking his car next to a wall in such a way that there is not a single millimetre between the car and the bricks. Not a single one.\nI blog this now only because the antique Jaguar, the mayoral vehicle EG1 is reportedly:\nand I for one would like to know how #PossibleRightOff happened.\nAnd what it costs to keep this particular mayor in maintenance and insurance.\nPerhaps Conservative councillors could tell the voters exactly what they each spend on driving around the city in very fancy cars, and how much of that expense is funded by residents?",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_leaflet/content_187.html": "Yesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.",

The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available.

The heat map was discussed in cabinet but all this particular councillor took away from the meeting was a magnificent opportunity to blame the Labour Party on Twitter for the hot spots.\nGiven the recent resignations of Cllrs Mahabadi and Ferris from East and Park wards respectively, and especially noting what they said in their resignation address, you’d expect him to think for a minute or two before launching into his usual blame game.

Her memories and stories would reduce me to tears of laughter as she brought the city she remembered to life.\nThen this morning, looking for something else entirely, I stumbled on an online book about Bungate.

So if you have the cash and could use that to pay, then we can keep that little bit. It all tots up, you see.”\nStartled. I paid with a note and got some coins back in my hand. I made a mental note to do something about the drift away from notes and coin. She had reminded me of something I’d forgotten.\nIsaac Newton got a mention in the programme for having gone after the coiners in his official capacity as Master of the Royal Mint. Coiners would snip off tiny pieces from the edges of circulating coins and they’d use the shavings to forge new ones. Counterfeiting is an age old criminal offence described here on the Royal Mint’s website.\nThis morning’s Ramblings came from Calderdale, and that is where some of the coining went on. Click the link for an article about it or hunt out the novel ‘The Gallows Pole’ by Benjamin Myers or look out for the six-part series, The Gallows Pole, which is expected to air on BBC One in 2023:\nRudyard Kipling’s poem The Coiner did not get a mention in this morning’s Ramblings. Kipling has been regarded as politically incorrect for a large part of my lifetime. But he is now being read by a post imperial generation, which seems to be able to read and to appreciate his work within the contexts of his time. I wonder what he’d have said about “card charges” and how he’d have described what the banks do to our cash each time they process our card transactions? Listen here to how his song pays tribute to the huge positive social impact the coiners had! And this probably isn’t merely the stuff of fiction, because they could not possibly have committed the crimes they did without a great many people being prepared to cooperate with them.\nCould one point thirty percent help to “wreck Britain’s economy”? And even if it couldn’t, should something be done about it? Anyone got an idea? Legal, of course.\nStriking workers assembled on Wednesday to hear speeches and protest against the government’s attempts to ban the legal and human right we all have to strike and our well established and accepted rights to demonstrate and protest.\nA strike is the withdrawal of labour and is used as a last resort by trades unions only when negotiations with employers are continuously failing to reach settlement. As I write, there is only one trades union with an offer on the table which might be acceptable to workers.\nJoin a union\nThere is a trades union for any worker.

To help achieve this we need to raise more money for printing than we’ve needed in any previous local election. What we raise will be used to print the leaflets which we distribute to residents. You can find out in detail how the money will be spent here.\nJoin our Crowd\nGreens often use Crowdfunding, which is a wonderful way to raise lots of small donations from a large community of people. We grow the “crowd” of donors by reaching out to include as many people in and beyond the city as we can reach.\nPlease share too\nThe cost of living means that many of the people who might usually feel able to donate, may not be able to do so this year. Please don’t feel bad, if this is the situation you are in. In the face of the crisis, we need to spread the word by sharing this post online, or by going to the Crowdfunder itself and sharing it from there. Shares also help!\nI had a useful exchange of information with the journalist since my second update. They’ve got through to the council and have been told the council is now going after “GKL”. I thought I’d established that they built the building and, presumably the embankment which has subsequently collapsed. The journalist were now being told that this entity is the property manager (which took me completely by surprise). So, RHRL is out of the picture, just for the moment. Which is interesting because as of a couple of days ago, the council’s press office were saying they were going after/in dispute/had settled with RHRL. Weren’t they? Isn’t it the name in the local paper, linked in my second update? Now why would the council’s press office have been saying that if it wasn’t true? Please note that my first assumption is absolutely not that the press office has “made a genuine error” (as claimed by Cllr Fitzgerald over the entirely unrelated cheque gate affair. But that is a whole other scandal.)\nCould this mean that the council is now chasing after a relevant, genuinely responsible entity and that maybe flat owners will not be held liable for the repairs? If so, there is hope.\nNew morning. New search. Google search immediately produces possibly irrelevant\nand, likely more relevant, GKL BUILDING & CIVIL ENGINEERING LTD\nTwo directors with significant influence or control.\nMr James Andrew BrackenburyACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthAugust 1977NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlHas significant influence or control\nWho has a B Eng in Civil Engineering from Nottingham Trent.\nand\nMr Eamonn Michael KillougheryACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthMay 1962NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlOwnership of shares – 75% or moreOwnership of voting rights – 75% or moreRight to appoint and remove directors\nand 28 other companies. Including GKL DEVELOPMENTS (UK) LTD, Company number 05599784. So what we have is a large multi sector group of companies, with activities including waste disposal, road construction, property development and management.\nThe story that the developer went broke looks unconvincing, at first glance, anyway. And anyway, thinking about it, where did that story come from? And why am I aerated about the issue? Oh yes, of course: Facebook.\nI’m not sure why Cllr Fitzgerald is still blocking me. Maybe he’s still cross about the starring role he played in my top post of all time?\nSo there we were about midday Friday 20th January. I came back to finish this early this morning.\nSince my first update on the collapse, the press got excited and phone calls were made. And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_ely/content_372.html": "Palmer Admits Government has Failed our Area\nJames Palmer is the Conservative candidate expecting to be crowned Mayor of the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on May 4th. Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nFirstly, Peterborough is BIGGER than Cambridge.\nI occasionally make just this point and people look at me as if I was mad. But yes it has been for a while and it still is. I’ve just double checked last census data available on Wikipedia:\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarked gets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn order to make something perfectly clear to your colleagues in a democratic forum it is a legal requirement to declare your interests. It is a criminal offence not to, if it happens to be a pecuniary interest. For some obscure reason, this requirement appears not to have been applied (at least by means of a publicly accessible document) by our Local Enterprise Partnership, until the MP complained. The Register is now available online and forms part of a section on Corporate Governance.\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.\nMeanwhile I’d love to know what you think.\nAnd if you happen to live in Chatteris or in Wisbech, I hope you vote for Julie too!",

Help spread the word: download and print electoral fraud poster 1 (sorry it isn’t beautiful, please send in your or a fresh or newer version!)\nNCT Nearly New SALE on Wednesday 25th March\nMy MP emailed me and he said:\nThank you for contacting me about fracking, I understand your concerns with this matter and appreciate your correspondence.\nShale gas is a promising new potential energy resource which could reduce our reliance on imported gas and help with keeping energy costs low. It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough\nI emailed my MP and I said:\nI am writing to ask you to vote against the Government’s changes to the Infrastructure Bill on fracking that remove any guarantee that drinking water sources will be protected from fracking, and to call for an immediate fracking moratorium.\nThe changes made in the House of Lords weaken several of the 13 conditions accepted by Government in the House of Commons, including vital provisions to protect drinking water from fracking.\nPlease vote to ensure fracking is banned in all ground water source protection zones 1 – 3.\nAlthough these protections would make fracking safer, they cannot make it safe because fracking is inherently risky, and would exacerbate climate change.\nI am therefore asking that you call for an immediate fracking moratorium in the House of Commons. While the UK Government attempts to weaken the few protections we have, the rest of Britain is taking measures to protect the health of communities and the climate.\nI urge you call on Government to follow the lead of Wales and Scotland by bringing forward an immediate fracking moratorium so that the risks to health and climate change can be fully investigated.\nThe sooner we follow in the footsteps of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, New York State, Denton (Texas) – and the rest of Britain – by stopping fracking, the better for our communities, the climate and our local environment.\nYours Sincerely,\nFiona Radic\nDid Peterborough police arrest a homeless man…\n.. without reading him his rights?\nAre Peterborough cyclists cannibals now?\nI’ve blogged before about Peterborough and the attitude to cyclists held by the Leader of the Council and the centre of the city has just experienced “aggressive pavement cyclists” targeted by police. (I deplore the use of a word like “aggressive” to stereotype a wide community which cycles on pavements.)\nBut here we go again, this time with a word which suggests one superior tribe (maybe driving Chelsea tractors?) looking down on another primitive and uncivilised group (maybe all these things because they can’t afford a Chelsea tractor?).\nGiven that bicycles can’t really eat one another, I assume the police peep believes that the cyclists are stealing each others’ bicycles? I’m really not sure how such a useless assertion will help the police catch thieves. What I can tell the police is that this use of language is calculated to annoy cyclists with even the smallest bit of linguistic and political sensitivity. Like me.\nI wonder when Peterborough’s leading political and police peeps will make it into the twentieth century and or cycling enlightenment?\nFirst Spalding Road. Now Fletton Parkway!\nThe A16 from Peterborough to Spalding subsided and was closed (if I remember correctly before it opened) until remedial work was completed. It starts in Paston Ward and travels through Northborough Ward in the Peterborough unitary authority area (governed by Peteborough City Council).\nIt then enters the Lincolnshire County Council & South Holland District Council areas where it travels through county & district wards: Crowland & Deeping St Nicholas, Moulton (Weston and Cowbit) and Spalding St Mary’s\nIt also passes through the following parishes:\nNewborough, Borough Fen (Peterborough)\nCrowland, Cowbit, Weston and Spalding South (South Holland, Lincolnshire)\nIt travels through two parliamentary constituencies: that of Peterborough Borough and South Holland and the Deepings.\nThe Fletton Parkway is the A1139\nThe roadworks which are currently underway and which have hit a £4.5M size brick are within the following areas of local government:\nparliamentary constituency: North West Cambridgeshire\nunitary authority area: Peterborough City Council\nunitary authority wards: Orton Waterville, Orton Longueville and Orton with Hampton\nparishes: Orton Waterville, Orton Longueville (and an unparished area)\nFurther reading\nNew Listerner\nPeterborough Telegraph\n30th January http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/politics-news/contaminated-soil-and-new-works-land-city-council-with-4-5-million-roads-bill-1-6549612\nWas there a Clerk of Works?\nOh!

Happy as always to be corrected.\nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST – FOI-14-0299 A1139 Fletton Parkway\nAlthough it looks from this document as if there were “site supervision and clerk of works functions” identified, it is clear that one contractor to the council appointed another contractor to the contractor to perform the roles. This is not the same as having one qualified person on one’s own team and begs the question who the possibly qualified person was. Happy as always to be corrected.\nIf Clerk of Works is the role which secures budgetary control (see above video), why isn’t Morson (the contractor apparently covering the role) picking up 100% of the £4.5M cost overrun? One way to establish the reason for this would be to subject the relevant contracts and subcontracts to scrutiny by a person competent in law of contract.\nPersonally, if I were the council I’d bring the role of Clerk of Works straight back in-house to establish and secure a clear line of responsibility and management. A good properly qualified person in this role could save the city a fortune over time. I know that breathtaking achievements (even if you only count the beans) are often made, quietly and without a brass band, by people doing this sort of job for other organisations.\nInformation on the history of the role of Clerk of Works within Peterborough City Council’s remit very welcome.\nMayor’s Charity Concert in Oundle Tonight\nThe Mayor’s Charity Concert begins at 7:45 tonight, Saturday January 17th at St. Peter’s Church Oundle.\nThe concert will showcase the talents of outstanding young performers, including previous winners of Oundle Young Musician of Year, Pianist Irena Radic & Cellist Ellen Porter and Daniel Dixon, 2014 Oundle Young Singer.

Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:",

And in this blog I began to look at and discuss the politics of Peterborough generally, partly in order to understand and explain the weaknesses of campaigning organisations in the city (who I then felt could all have done better) against a political decision to incinerate, based on levels of (elected councillor) ignorance which I’d never encountered before in any organisation. I needed to understand how that had happened too, and who benefits from a toxic waste disposal policy. Who benefits from a waste policy which isn’t working.\nMeanwhile it seems that the attitudes I encountered: literally: “if you can’t see it, there is nothing there” approach to stack emissions has created a national problem, especially in England, which now does things worse and to lower standards than Scotland, Wales, the USA and Europe. Brexit might offer hope to those that are keen to practice toxic politics, but the toxins left in our environment aren’t going anywhere.\nBut about three years ago the Green Party began a Flash Mob Litter Pick, which roved around in response to resident callouts to deal with litter hotspots. Here’s a Flash Mob after a session litter picking in 2016, taken in a New England cul de sac: Like any litter picker, we were dealing with the council and its ways of doing things, with the odd hazardous item (discarded hypodermic needles are one of the worst at the moment) and we were also thinking about things like the bags the council uses, why people do what they do, where it comes from and how it travelled to where it is. We had hundreds of conversations, with each other, with passers by, with the council and with the people who deal with fly tipped toxic wastes (such as paints, oils, chemicals). It didn’t take us long to appreciate that people were sometimes being turned away by the legal disposal routes because of the way they had been implemented by the council or because of the conversations they had had with council operatives. We encountered a number of people who had been turned away from the Household Waste centre at Dogsthorpe. We realised that if you make people feel they are doing something wrong when they thought they were doing something right (they just didn’t know about the law or the procedure for doing what the council requires them to do) you are probably just building anti-council feelings and even another fly tip. The council operative is probably doing the right thing: saying all the right things, but the person to whom they are talking is struggling to cope with the situation. Some people get angry. Some people are shocked. In this situation, people may hear what is said to them, but they won’t be able to listen. So as we picked, we worked out that if one cul de sac could produce two car boot fulls of waste and a pile of fly tip, then there would be several skips full in each ward in the city. The volume of discarded waste lying around in our environment, defining our environment for everyone living or growing up in it – are unbelievable.\nWith fly tip, we looked at it and we began to understand the impact of the nice man at the front door who offers to take away your rubbish despite not having obtained the all important waste carrier’s licence. The role of this character is key: he (we think it is usually a he!) has perfectly understood the business opportunity provided to him by this corporate communications disaster.\nSometimes it is a whole house contents which is tipped out onto the highway, or someone else’s private property. Anybody in Peterborough can see that there is a big problem with landlords, or with people providing services to landlords and tenants. People living in or running the rental sector grab the cheapest furniture, because tenures are short and incomes are tight and what could be a re-use opportunity is instead a dumped problem. Legitimate house clearance businesses: where are they?\nJulie Howell (pictured here in New England) took the conclusions to Orton Waterville where she was a parish councillor and she applied herself to communicating directly with every resident. Waste management was just one of the things she tackled in her communications. Here she discusses fly tipping on her blog:\nAnd here she is discussing fly tip on Radio Cambridgeshire yesterday morning:\nYesterday she was responding to the council leader who made some interesting comments in an article published in the Peterborough Telegraph soon after Julie was elected to the city councillor and thereby displaced the cabinet member responsible for waste management. The paper’s headline and the photograph put fly tipping into the spotlight.\nFirst he announces that fly-tipping will be “a focus” for the council this coming year. And admits that the issue was “repeatedly raised on the doorsteps in the run-up to the elections.” This might suggest that there is hope.\nBut then he says something really interesting. What he appears to do in a scant four lines of text, is give a summary of the results of the Free Bulky Waste Trial. I don’t know if a detailed analysis of the results of the trial has been made available to elected councillors or whether or not that analysis breaks down at ward level. But if not that is what I’d be asking for if I was a councillor.\nHoldich claims that the trial “made no difference to the amount of fly-tipping,” This suggests that the council has a way of very accurately measuring fly tipping activity over a period of time. That would be very interesting, if it were true. I think the police might be interested in how the council knows this too, since not being able to catch fly tippers is one of its defining and most annoying characteristics.\nThen he asserts that “the council missed out on £40,000 from fewer paid collections.” Now, assuming he’s right about that, it suggests to me that the people making use of the free trial were people who would otherwise have called the council to arrange a paid for collection. This group of people, complying with existing procedures and forking out for the collections they organise does not strike me as an appropriate target group if you wanted to attract the waste which is being fly tipped and the people doing the fly tipping, because this group is by Holdich’s definition not fly-tipping their waste anyway. They are doing it correctly and dutifully providing the council with additional revenue.\nThen Holdich claims that “It’s a national problem and nobody has come up with a panacea.” I think by calling on a Greek goddess, he is both looking for and deriding a universal fix. He might do better if he looked systematically at another goddess: Hygeia is the Greek goddess of cleanliness and hygiene, a goddess understood by the Greeks to be part of Aesclepius’ family of medicine, health and feeling good generally.\nBut let’s have a closer look at the council’s “Free Bulky Waste Trial”. It was designed to run for thirteen weeks: from 11th December to 9th March. A bulky waste collection normally costs £23.50. So adding up the available collections during the free trial, we have a cap of 52 collections per day, and an estimated “more than 1,000 free collections” during month one. Then a maximum of 26 per day for the remainder of the trial. Residents would be free to book a collection between 4th December to 5th March. So what actually happened?\nWe don’t know, except that the available slots were taken up enthusiastically to the extent that no more bookings for free collections were taken from 25th January, six weeks before the trial was supposed to end. Taking Christmas into account, the Trial stopped half way through. In fact it didn’t survive the Spring Clean Season. When the council closed new advance bookings, it was clear already that it was well organised people who were using the trial.\nWhat we do know is that if £40,000 revenue was lost to the council because people using the trial would otherwise have booked a chargeable collection, then 1702 free collections were made who’d otherwise pay for those collections. These will have been well organised people complying with procedures, who probably were unlikely to be fly tipping waste or giving it to to a fly tipper masquerading as a legitimate waste handler before the trial began.\nThe big question, then, is how many collections were made above 1702.\n52 per day for the first month would give us four weeks one of which includes the Christmas break. So let’s say 52 x 4 x 3 = 624\nThen we have 26 per day for the other nine weeks, so x 4 x 9 = 936\nIf we add these figures together and take them away from 1702, we get 142.\nRoughly one hundred and forty two collections were available to people who maybe would NOT normally have called the council. And that figure can only be true if the council and those people were able to use every single slot it had available. Given that this target group is likely to be less well organised, less well resourced and generally less compliant with how the council runs things, I find this highly unlikely.\nWe don’t know if the council added capacity, as it promised it would at the outset of the trial if demand was high. And if it didn’t, we don’t know why it didn’t. It may have realised that the non fly tipping community was not engaging very much with its trial, and if so, that would not surprise me.\nI am sure that Holdich feels that the trial proves his point. I dare say it proves mine too: that the systems in place are unfit for purpose for many sections of our community and it is also clear that the ruling Conservatives still have no sensible plan in place to change that.\nThis is the speech I delivered to residents and activists at Park Ward Hustings on 15th April in the run up to the local elections on May 3rd – this is the uncut version\nWe live in Park Ward so we live in the heart of Peterborough\nI am delighted to be standing again in Park Ward this year. I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.\nAt the time “Jessica”‘s story broke, I expected people in Peterborough who knew the gregarious and popular Cllr Andy Coles to experience shock and there has been a little of that. That is why I wrote about the sensation of falling which is how the shock of the allegations first affected me.\nI have been too busy out and about campaigning to write much about this story but while I’ve been busy a great deal has happened. This post is an update and a pulling together of threads.\nThe council can’t do anything\nFirstly in response to a number of points and questions I communicated to the council’s leader and chief executive officer, the council has explained its position with respect to removing an elected representative:\n“The legal position is that all democratically elected councillors, are entitled as of right to attend all meetings of full council. There is no power for officers or members to remove that right.”\nSo while “Jessica” believes that Coles should resign as a city councillor (and I wholeheartedly support her call) I don’t think that anybody can force that to happen. If Coles continues not to resign, it seems that he can’t be pushed.\nHis party won’t do anything\nI believe that a decent political party would have suspended Coles already, pending clarification of his situation. However his party is the Conservative Party which is in power and which has been close to being in power for a century. It is an integral part of the establishment which has used the police to target over 1,000 organisations, including my own political party, my party’s only MP and my party’s only member of the House of Lords. This is why I personally have no expectations that the Conservative Party will even worry about behaving decently: that simply isn’t what the party or the British establishment is about. They are about power full stop. If they did suspend or expel him I would expect him to opt to remain in post as an independent councillor. This may be more of a worry to them than his remaining in post. The horrible question which then arises is where are the other 120 ex spy cops and how do their current networks, contacts, employments or appointments help to protect their secrets and abuses or those of others and to what extent and how might such arrangements be tolerated or even organised? Let’s not underestimate the usefulness of professional, political and cultural networks. Cllr Coles is one of the best connected people in Peterborough.\nThree investigations are underway: none of which stop him talking\nBack to fast moving present reality. There are now three investigations or cases ongoing. As far as I am aware none of these require Coles to maintain silence on the allegations: his silence is entirely a matter of personal choice, not of contractual or legal obligation. I am as ever happy to be corrected.\nwhich at first glance looks as if the IPCC is not investigating and did not investigate. But if you check what the IPCC does and how it does it, it is perfectly possible that this interpretation is not quite correct. IPCC can supervise local investigations without actually doing them. This statement does not eliminate the possibility that it could be involved in supervising a Cambridgeshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (Cambridgeshire OPCC or here just OPCC) investigation which hasn’t started yet. As for regulations, here is something which may or may not help in understanding what they are and what will or won’t happen next.\nIn order to understand what has or hasn’t happened here, it would be necessary to see both referrals and to form a judgement about their sufficiency or otherwise. It would also be necessary to understand whether these referrals relate only to Coles’ behaviour while he was applying for or occupying the post of Cambridgeshire Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner (as I strongly suspect is the case).\nMeanwhile the local paper indicates that the Cambridgeshire OPCC has delegated the investigation to the Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel. This body meets next on 6th September. The agenda for that meeting is not yet online, but it should be available on the 1st at the latest.\nWe really do need to know what Coles’ motives were in going for the role of Deputy PCC and we need to know everything about who knew the whats and the whys about that appointment.\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nPlease let me know if I have been incorrectly advised.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nIf whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so promptly, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity and (unfortunately now) your stated personal approval (I think you may have done this in some ignorance of the gravity of what has been alleged – I know you are a very busy man).\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well. It is important that the Andy …\nIn her own words: “I welcome the news that Andy Coles has resigned from his post as Cambridgeshire’s Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner. I would like to know …\nColes did resign quickly and in terms of media coverage in a sudden and media-spectacular way from his post as Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner but he did this on the basis that the allegations were getting in the way of him performing the role, not on a point of principle or honour. I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nA list is available below the video on this post.\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him. It is reasonable that he is suspended. It is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while these dreadful allegations remain unresolved.\nPeterborough Green Party supports the continued use of the Spectators Gallery as what it says on this notice:\nSpectators Gallery sign in Peterborough Town Hall showing the way up four flights of stairsand the door leading to it from Bridge Street. #OpenTheDoor (locked last Wednesday).\nPress Coverage of Coles’ resignation from his PCC role\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned following allegations that he deceived … Cambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy Coles resigns.\nThe allegation relates to Andy Coles‘ work as an undercover police officer in the 1990s. … Cambridgeshire’s deputy PCC resigns over ‘sex deceit’ claim.\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned after being accused of deceiving a woman into a sexual relationship while he was an undercover officer.

But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\nMy January 2015 post received quite a bit of feedback and I realised that I was wrong about what the remedy is. Or at any rate that what I believed I meant was capable of being misunderstood. So, I don’t believe that the city needs a Clerk of Works any more. I believe that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works. I didn’t update my blog at the time (I often don’t) but now that the issue of budgets and management of major infrastructure projects at Peterborough City Council will be making headlines again, I am correcting my recommended solution so as to make absolutely clear to decision makers what I believe Peterborough needs.\nI learned last year that technically – i.e. on paper, legally, contractually and presumably somewhere in its accounts spreadsheet the council can actually claim to “have” a Clerk of Works. But also that (astonishingly) that function is currently performed by an employee or employees of the contractor doing the job and is not necessarily even a single nameable person. It may be “contractually normal” to organise a clerk of works function like this: I am told it is. But to my mind it is a notion, provided in the contract, but where it sits in any practical sense and who performs the function and why these persons unknown’s first loyalty should be our council and how the council can hold them accountable (for example by sacking them) is all shrouded in mystery. So a Clerk of Works is effectively useless: like a button floating free of the shirt, as it were.\nI believe now that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works who must be a member of Peterborough City Council’s staff, on their payroll and their payroll only and 100% and solely accountable to Peterborough City Council. I believe that role should be filled by a highly qualified person (i.e., they might have at least one civil engineering degree). They should be paid a professional and competitive salary and that the job should be advertised publicly and include local advertisements and the appointment process should be open to scrutiny within the council’s audit and compliance procedures.\nThe In House Clerk of Works I envisage would be supported by a planning department within the city council with immediate access to council archives and records. It is not good enough for planning staff to be located in one place and the documents in another. It is very difficult for members of the public to cope with the current system. How members of staff cope with using it on a daily basis beats me. I remain suspicious about how the Fletton Parkway contaminated land managed to come as a surprise to the Fletton Parkway Widening Project team:\nThe In House Clerk of Works should be empowered to scrutinise and halt any and all jobs done for the council at any stage in the application, approval and completion processes and to withhold sign off and payment until all the council’s quality standards are met. I hate seeing money being spent on works which are shoddy and unpleasing to the eye and hearing about decisions which nobody realised were as bad as they were at the time.* It does nothing for our local environments, which we pay good money to empower our councils to improve. And it does even less for our self respect as a city.\nIncidentally, taking down a wood or removing a green space is not a neutral act. In an Environment City you’d expect it to be considered especially controversial. But in addition to basic ecological concerns, woodland has long been used to conceal problems with the soil. Where you can’t grow a crop, farmers and landowners will often grow trees which will perform all sorts of useful functions within a landscape. Perhaps the cost of removing these particular patches of woodland and scrub will teach Peterborough to respect its green spaces and what they are actually doing a little more? We are often told by people who don’t realise we depend upon it and that we live in it that we “can’t afford” the environment. Perhaps this wacky but all too widespread reasoning informed the decision to widen Fletton Parkway? But in the city with the highest dependency on cars, it is likely that a £6M overspend (on top of what was originally budgeted) will be seen as “unavoidable” and “necessary”, because building a bigger road network remains at the uncontested top of Peterborough’s spending priorities.\n*For example:\nthe decision to turn one third of the A1139 parkway lights off and damaging whole lengths of under road cabling in the process, leaving a lethal bright stretch followed by a dark stretch, a bright stretch and another dark stretch. This light and dark lighting phenomenon (particularly noticeable near Stanground) happened all around the city because decision makers failed to check with the relevant qualified electrician what the impact of removing those particular light bulbs would be. In order to put it right all the affected lengths of road would have to be dug up.\n“Peterborough needs The Broadway Theatre, it does not need more flats. Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_ed-murphy/content_674.html": "Last night full council refused to discuss the executive pay award which Cllr Ed Murphy (LAB) raised as a comment on the minutes. Ed claims the award has a dating problem and could therefore have been made ultra vires.\nI was so stunned by the way this was handled by the new mayor (legal advice or comment was not even sought) that I missed the exact words of the dismissal, but it was dismissed in about four words. Could have been “You can’t have that.” Over so quickly.\nBasically from the Spectators Gallery our council appeared not interested last night in defending itself in public against a charge it may have acted “beyond its powers”, i.e. unconstitutionally. Not only that, but on one of the most politically contentious areas of its responsibility: executive pay being a marker for escalating levels of inequality in society and in our organisations.\nWhereas various councillors sprang to support Harrington’s dismissed second motion (which by then was history), not a single councillor supported Ed Murphy’s assertion (either properly at the time or subsequently by way of solidarity or rhetorical effect – both options being wide open to them).\nIt seems to me that there are at least three possible explanations:\nWhich is it? Or is there another?\nSo glad I’m not the minutes secretary!",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_cycle-2/content_133.html": "This evening Cllr Darren Fower proposed a motion at Full Council. The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_08_09_accounting-for-rhubarb-bridge-decision/content_504.html": "I have asked people why the council hadn’t gone all out to fund a replacement bridge as soon as it realised Rhubarb Bridge was suffering an unusual degree of decay. This would have made sense, especially since there are national funding pots for sustainable travel infrastructure, and this bridge might well have qualified.\nI wrote a post about the stakeholder event, at which my question did not receive an answer.\nSince then I have I received one really useful reply. My interlocutor pointed out to me that the money for repairs and maintenance comes out of the Revenue pot at the council. Revenue is for running costs, costs which recur year after year. The money for the an surface roundabout or for a replacement bridge would come out of the Capital pot. Capital is for one off costs, for buying or building assets such as buildings and infrastructure.\nThis made me think. Pressure on the Revenue pot is extreme. And it might be this extreme funding pressure which is leading to a decision not to maintain. If it replaces an an annual maintenance bill with a one off capital bill (with arguably a smaller ongoing maintenance cost), it will be relieving pressure on the funds which are needed to look after people in extreme need.\nFunding pressures on local government affect their Revenue funding primarily. Pressure on capital funding is not as bad. Revenue funds are used to fund social care, road repairs and waste disposal. It is this funding stream which is under impossible strains as central government imposes its Austerity measures and renders all our services less and less able to cope. So all local authorities have to balance roads and waste against social care. It is quite clearly insane, but until we sack the government as we are entitled to do at each general election, there is no sign of a change in this wicked situation. And local authority roads get a small fraction of the maintenance money which Highways England gets to maintain trunk roads. Unfortunately Rhubarb Bridge does not belong to Highways England. It belongs to the council.\nThis leaves a number of items which haven’t been accounted for: lets call them uncounted elephants in the room:\n- The likely cost of accidents at an at surface crossing. It is clear that this has not been factored in. There is clearly an increased risk of impacts on emergency, hospital and care services budgets.\n- The impact of being at ground level at an air pollution hot spot on all pedestrian and cyclists using the route. The higher you are the less likely you are to be inhaling high concentrates of particulates. The closer you are the more certain it is. In pushchairs children are face to face with exhaust pipes and this is just one reason (of many) why parents pop them in what seems to be the safer environment of a car.\n- The at surface crossing will result in cyclists taking to the road, rather than wait.\n- The at surface crossing will result in people getting into a car in preference to walking with a pram or pushchair.\nAnd it leaves my original question standing: why the council hasn’t tried to get hold of (let us add “capital”) funding to rebuild the bridge – if it is beyond economic repair?",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_author_fionaradic_page_7/content_738.html": "This is the speech I delivered to residents and activists at Park Ward Hustings on 15th April in the run up to the local elections on May 3rd – this is the uncut version\nWe live in Park Ward so we live in the heart of Peterborough\nI am delighted to be standing again in Park Ward this year. I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nJulie Howell, the Green Party’s mayoral candidate for the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (which includes Huntingdonshire) went to the Treasury in the snow to protest the underfunding of Peterborough.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim.

They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.",

(My sample was tiny: but I did one.) They fined about a third of the people they stopped: most of them probably incapable of being polite and apologising nicely to a policeman. (Some offenders just got warned, although whether or not cycling on a pavement is an offence in all circumstances is a moot point.) So I think it only fair to point out that cycling on the pavement can be a perfectly logical and reasonable response to dangerous junctions, roads and cycle lanes and is a better place to cycle if your lights have just packed up.\nCars which park in the Park Road cycle lane, or across it or on the pavement are a regular feature of life at this end of Park Road and I for one don’t think it is safe. I think badly behaved drivers are one of a number of contributory factors encouraging “pavement cycling”.\nI didn’t paint in the double yellow lines (which most people don’t even believe are there any more: they are virtually worn out). The Conservative council did. So I think elected Conservative members of all people should be able to show us how we can all live happily with their decisions.\nA third was the proportion fined according to the police at a police panel I attended, if memory serves. If there are people who are being injured by hit and run cyclists, then there needs to be an education campaign. This is not a problem limited to cyclists. It would also be good to see offenders taken to court through a legitimate and fair process. If the council really wants to get cyclists onto the road, the safety and condition of cycle lanes should be a top priority.\nLikeLike\nAnd, as I have pointed out before, the action on pavement cyclists was called for by concerned pedestrians, some of them having been victims (several needing hospital treatment). One third were fined? Have you obtained information from the Police? Pavement cyclists wre spoken to by the Police and Council Road Safety officers which, I wluld suggest, was not unreasonable. Meanwhile, I have also pressed for action on speeding traffic, attending sppedwatch sessions; and have held a number of meetings with Road Safety Team officers to discuss the need for better, more joined-up cycle lanes, as well as the introduction of 20mph speed limits in residential areas across the city. In fact, I attended this year’s annual 20s Plenty conference in Cambridge, along with the Principal Road Safety officer. I think my record stands up! Richard Ferris (Lab, Park Ward).\nLikeLike\nThey are all breaking road traffic act and highway code rule 140 by parking in a cycle lane! If they want to enforce road laws let’s put own house in order first!\nLikeLike\nUtterly unsurprising I’m afraid. These people wouldn’t know sustainable travel if they tripped over it.\nLikeLike\nRule 240 of your Highway Code fellas.\nAnd car numbers one and three are breaking Rule 239 of the Highway Code by parking facing oncoming traffic.\nCannot quite see if they are breaking Rule 243, with regards to parking next to a dropped kerb or in front of an entrance to a property. So I’ll let that one pass.\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peteborough-city-council/content_35.html": "This evening Cllr Darren Fower proposed a motion at Full Council. The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_notinmyname/content_438.html": "Today’s story about the jailing of Philippa by Judge Noble in Peterborough highlights several critical problems in Peterborough.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\nRanked with all the other parliamentary constituencies in the UK, the City of Peteborough is ranked fifth from the bottom. Bad driving is at epidemic levels in the city and around it. And given its appalling safety record, one has to ask why Judge Noble feels any need to conciliate the community of motorists living anywhere round here.\nThis is not Philippa’s fault either.\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\n4 Jan 2017",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_05_31_open-letter-pr/content_696.html": "There’s a Hole in your Logic\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nLet’s look at what Fiona Onasanya has had to say on electoral reform. A quick google search produces no comments on electoral reform (except where her name comes up alongside mine!). (Beki Sellick: very similar). As for Stewart Jackson: he has voted against electoral reform or been absent on every available occasion.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nGiven the maths, I don’t rate Labour’s chances in Peterborough at all. I don’t think Lisa Forbes thought she stood a hope either. There is only one candidate who could have swung it, in my opinion: the one who won) in the Peterborough area in the PCC election in 2012.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\nI hope this letter helps to minimise that risk.\nUseful links:\ntactical2017.com #Tactical2017\nTimeline:\n25/4/17 11:26 LAB 2015 candidate regrets she can’t stand in June 2017\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n29/4/17 12:50 UKIP announces it won’t field a candidate\n2/5/17 11:54 Greens announce their Peterborough (& NWC) selection results\n2/5/17 23:34 LAB reveal Fiona Onasanya is their Peterborough candidate\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

This photo was taken from the Spectators Gallery which is currently closed. Elected councillors are (I think) sitting at the long tables with some very strange headwear at rest on them. None of them is female, although there are a few women sitting behind them, one with a dark cloche hat and most of the others sporting dark berets. Headwear is not flashy. The gallery (behind the photographer) is probably full to bursting. Guests and public are seated around the councillors very tightly, leaving “the floor” clear. Slender tables are unencumbered with lights and mics. The room is shown at its best: lit by daylight. The Mayor’s parlour is packed with what could be a choir in uniform (door to the right) and so is the balcony of the foyer (door to the left). The principal uniform is the man’s suit, worn with greater or less formality. One or two of the men may be wearing gowns and one on the left side may be wearing a chain of office. High table is court like. The chair’s chair is a proper throne and whoever sat on it would have a commanding view of the entire room, including the whole of the Spectators Gallery. (The current layout – I’m not sure when or why the room was turned around – is not at all as clever from the point of view of the chair.) Still familiar today: the person in clerical garb. The architecture is happily and joyfully calling on medieval precedent within a confident classically formatted & commercially alive building (rented shops were built below this room, the income to the council intended to keep rates as low as possible).

I had made a note to check where it would be on Friday (tomorrow) when there is a chance to witness a near total solar eclipse. People have made plans and some have plotted parties and bought cameras, filters, projectors and protective eye wear, ready for the big day.\nInstead we have “fog”. This is a polite word for particulate laden and polluted air. It might be a lot more accurate to call it “smog”. Yesterday it almost lifted just after lunch and shafts of sunlight penetrated into the city centre. Today we have what looks like heavy cloud. But it is more likely that the smog has simply floated up a bit. The government website is predicting worse pollution levels on Friday than today.\nI joined the Green Party in 2007 as I tried to reverse Peterborough City Council’s decision to support the incineration of domestic waste. This was a battle which we campaigners lost. We saw a neighbouring proposal fall in the face of a far more successful campaign. Lessons were learned, as they say. And I started to consider the vexed question of what exactly drives politics in Peterborough.\nA key supporter of incineration of waste is Cllr Marco Cereste (he is also a director of Peterborough Renewable Energy Limited which builds slightly cleaner incinerators than the one the council is building). As leader of the council he personally attracts huge amounts of anger, frustration and suspicion: some of it reasonable, some of it less so. But in the last couple of weeks he has told the story of his signing (on behalf of the city he represents) a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on his facebook profile (shared with his facebook friends). This MoU is with an entity locals understand is a Chinese government funded organisation, possibly what we’d call in the UK, an “NGO” (non governmental organisation).\nThen in an online discussion elsewhere entirely about this morning’s fog, someone shared this video which I hadn’t come across previously. The story of this video’s making and removal from Chinese social media is available online. I just wish that we’d had this video at the time the council’s decision was still not made. At the notorious moment when Pam Kreling (then one of the councillors making the crucial decision about whether or not to use incineration) said words to the effect that if she couldn’t see anything emerging from a stack, then there was nothing there and there was by implication nothing which could do anyone any harm. As campaigners we weren’t allowed to speak at critical moments in meetings: in fact the chair of one of the meetings offered to have me and Richard Olive thrown out when we stood up to tell them they were being hopelessly misinformed by their advisors. But as I observed this pantomime (there was no beadle to implement the Chair’s desire) I was left reeling from a deeper revelation. I still wonder how people in key positions got through even basic level schooling, what exactly went on in their science lessons and what their marks were.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_politics_page_6/content_740.html": "This is the speech I delivered to residents and activists at Park Ward Hustings on 15th April in the run up to the local elections on May 3rd – this is the uncut version\nWe live in Park Ward so we live in the heart of Peterborough\nI am delighted to be standing again in Park Ward this year. I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nJulie Howell, the Green Party’s mayoral candidate for the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (which includes Huntingdonshire) went to the Treasury in the snow to protest the underfunding of Peterborough.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2013_12_13_solardebate-with-all-sides-taking-part-paulstainton/content_435.html": "I happily accepted an invitation to join a “participating audience” tonight and gave away my ticket for the James Galway concert in Ely Cathedral.\nI turned up at the Copeland Community Centre to listen to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) challenge the solar voltaic project planned for Newborough and which has been vocally and enthusiastically led by Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative), Leader of Peterborough City Council (Conservative) who believes it presents the answer to what he (Conservative) describes as “the black hole” created by the ConDem (but mainly Conservative) government of which Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) is an elected representative. They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked. Something has to be very seriously wrong: when nobody\n- understands the process\n- bothers to explain it\n- knows what it is or\n- why it is there\nWhy does nobody ever challenge this preposterous pile of garbage? If someone fly-tipped vomit soaked nappies all over Cllr Nick Sandford (Liberal Democrat), would he actually mind? I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\n- lack of transparency (no figures available to the residents of Peterborough and – because I couldn’t ask my second question the audience was able to rest secure in the assumption – to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) himself.\n- treatment of farmers (I’ll expand for him here: the council’s first communication to 18 farmers was to warn them that they would be evicted if the plan went ahead)\n- risk of a change in the subsidy regime: no safety plan if the government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) changes the regime governing ROCs (again no discussion: no explanation)\n- no contingency fund if the sums are wrong\n- conflict with government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) policy on renewables (this was not explained at all)\n- has no plan B (if I may expand any decent proposal presents alternatives, preferably a well thought out range of options)\n- didn’t even know which brownfield sites it owned\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this. I think Peterborough should be enthusiastically refusing to reduce its tenanted farm land holdings.\nOnce Paul Stainton said they were starting to wind up and I still hadn’t succeeding in asking any of my questions I decided that since I wasn’t actually required as a speaking participant, as I had expected, I wasn’t going to be part of any awful preorganised tedious windbag wind up. So I left and expressed my feelings as clearly as I possibly could (being at that point absolutely livid) to David Murray, radio editor.\nSo what questions would I have asked? I had two: the first was in response to Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative). I wanted to ask him (and I’ll be honest I really wanted to ask this in front of a rolling TV camera):\n- Can you explain why you are not sure exactly how much income the solar voltaic array on the Freemans building is bringing in and why should anyone trust your figures if you are in the slightest bit uncertain on this point?\nAnd the other one was to Stewart Jackson. I wanted to ask him:\n- Whether or not public authorities (including Peterborough City Council) don’t have to disclose to our elected representative in parliament whatever information is requested of them and to confirm that he does actually have all the figures because he has asked the city council for them and they have been obliged to disclose them.\nPlease go to @PaulStainton or https://twitter.com/PaulStainton for more and use hashtag #solardebate\nPlease comment here if you don’t tweet or want more space\nHi Fiona,\nThank you for the email about that t***** S Jackson – under orders from above no doubt.\nThere is no doubt a lot of money and influence being applied by vested interests in the present unsustainable system.\nOn a happier note, please see attached a poster for our Christmas Party on Fri 2oth Dec, where all new starters go FREE J\nYou are warmly invited to join us, along with any friends that could do with a fun evening out J\nPlease advertise the event for us, if you can, as the more people attend, the better the atmosphere J\nBest wishes,\nAlan\nLikeLike",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_election_page_2/content_624.html": "The Green Party is the East of England’s Remain Party and the UK’s biggest pro-European party in the European Parliament.\nWe have launched our campaign to mobilise one of the strongest pro-European movements anywhere on the continent. Our campaign is proudly standing up for free movement, for gold standard climate action and for the rights of all Europeans. Now is the time to decide what kind of Britain we want to have and what our values are.\nWe are asking you to #JoinOurCrowd of backers.\nIf we can grow our fundraising crowd big enough we will raise enough to leaflet every home in the region (yes: that is millions!), and we will be able also to fund a social media campaign to ensure that everybody can see what we are standing for in this election. By all means give us a big donation. Or if you can’t do that, give us a small donation: whatever you can afford. But please whatever you can or can’t do in the way of money, please give us a share. Sharing will take this post to people not in my social media network already and if they also share to people we’ve never reached before. Please share this with people you think might be delighted to support our hard working team to win our first seat in Eastern. So important for our region to bring European Green cooperation, constructiveness and creativity into our part of the world.\nSocial media offers politicians a very tempting way of doing all sorts of things. To my mind, there is nothing wrong with that. On the face of it.\nBut what people reading things on social media don’t always know is that there are laws governing political messaging and advertising, and also that social media offers ingenious ways of getting round rules.\nOne of the UK rules is to do with imprints: basically an imprint allows the reader to understand who is behind what they are reading. In turn this allows the reader to check who is behind whatever or whoever is being promoted. Look for the small print on any political flier which is delivered through your letterbox. You should find it. It is a legal requirement.\nThis “imprint” is key to finding out who is being promoted (usually a candidate) and (with this knowledge) who is funding a political campaign, and yes, there is also UK legislation surrounding political donations to UK campaigns. Another legal requirement is to obey the laws about donations.\nCampaigners in Peterborough found a piece of printed material which lacked an imprint during the EU Referendum campaign. This was reported to the Electoral Commission. It is an offence to omit an imprint, although this A5 flier wasn’t impressive and at first glance this is not a big thing. It could always be someone who is a newcomer to political campaigner and who doesn’t know any better. That’s wrong, but understandable. But….\nThe imprint rules for social media advertising by political entities have no legal force behind them. They are merely recommendations laid down by the Electoral Commission indicating basic standards of good practice. This leaves people who know very much better than a beginner able to advertise on social media, deliberately concealing the organiser, the cause, the funder and the objectives. One I think fits this description crossed my path recently.\nHere’s me, picking up on someone’s comment that an image in a facebook advertisement featured comes from a Third Reich archive. It reminded me of a certain Prime Ministerial field of wheat. Even the wheat is old fashioned: we don’t grow it tall like that any more. We’re in the realms of nostalgia.\nHere’s his tweet:\nYou might have seen this popping into your timeline recently. You probably focused on the words, but let's examine the image. pic.twitter.com/nItcYLD7M7\nIt's a painting by Wolfgang Willrich, a leading artist of the Third Reich. He organised the Nazis' Degenerate Art exhibition. He refused party membership because he considered it *too soft* on modern \"cultural bolshevist\" art. https://t.co/x3xus5xKQc\nDon't think that the people behind this organisation don't know that. It didn't take me long to discover it. Third Reich Art to go with their Third Reich agenda.\nThe other painting was Erntepause (Break in the Harvest) by Georg Günther, one of at least two artists by that name. Here is the detail as used on the website. pic.twitter.com/uyAkhryRH3\nThe painting is in @GNM_Nuernberg's collection. It provides this background. Hitler liked it so much that he personally acquired it at one of the approved German art exhibitions (where many of Willrich's works, incidentally, were displayed). Good choice to champion rural Britain. pic.twitter.com/66QGROtxi3\nWhat seized my interest is that I’ve already seen the image out of the corner of my eye. It has already crossed my facebook feed, but as I was doing something else (as I usually am) I paid it no attention: I registered the image, but didn’t read the text. This is how subliminal advertising works. But now that someone has said something astonishing about the picture the advertisement, text and picture, now has my full attention. So (apologising for the format – it looks so much better on twitter!) here we go:\nBut it isn't really like that. It is much nastier. Check out the thread below to the end and then go and have a look at the entity on twitter which it discusses. @JohnofThorneyhttps://t.co/6hO2AyiAMG Then tell me what you think this organisation is likely doing.\nSo then I go looking for Robert J Davies the journalist behind the website and (at 9am this morning the only named person on it – a new twitter handle has just taken over the comms). At 12:26 still no address or contact details provided, so it could be run by anyone anywhere.\nAgain, assuming I've tracked down the right person, what is he doing running a website to unite the right in the UK with literal N a z i imagery @Ofcom@ElectoralCommUK@carolecadwalla@Twitter@NCA_UK Who's funding the operation please?\nThis looks like an operation to collect email addresses and to raise funds: but it will have to be funded by someone, somewhere. I and every other person who encounters this should be able to see who is doing what and for whom. We can’t.\nPart one was an email, and isn’t on my blog.\nHappy to be corrected: I looked at this a few days ago and just went over what I did. Nothing much has changed, except the organisation now claims it is in the UK (but doesn’t provide an address) and the entity the website claims is editing it is apparently also in the UK: https://twitter.com/rjdavies7 I have no idea if these two accounts relate to the same human being.\nNorth West Cambridgeshire is a historically extremely safe seat. It is where the Conservative Party stand the candidates they really don’t want to risk losing. Brian Mawhinney (eventually CON Party Chairman) was MP for Peterborough but was moved to the neighbouring North West Cambridgeshire constituency when Peterborough started to look a bit too risky.\nA “safe” seat presents a number of challenges to residents but also to opposition parties, one of which is that voters who know their vote “doesn’t count” (in terms of securing democratic representation) are inclined to think that their vote “isn’t counted” (but watch this video to see why this is an entirely different thing!).\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\na statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\na statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\nthe revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\nthe loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\nthe loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\nthe exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\nthe exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\nthe exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\nthe possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\nthe likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\nno plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\nthe awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\nLeave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\nLeave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\nthe growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.\nI thought I’d share a couple of thoughts. The first is about “counting agents”. There was a recount for Fletton & Stanground called by UKIP, who were only three votes away from winning third place. The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_politics_page_9/content_702.html": "A petition launched apparently launched three weeks before Thursday’s decision of the UK electorate to Leave the EU has garnered over three million signatures since Thursday as I write at half past ten on Sunday morning.\nSomeone asked me:\n“I have 5 friends sharing this. The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\n- a statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\n- a statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\n- the revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\n- the loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\n- the loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\n- the exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\n- the exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\n- the exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\n- the possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\n- the likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\n- no plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\n- the awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\n- Leave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\n- Leave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\n- the growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.",

If this committee does not “call-in” the decision the council is expected to proceed with incineration plans which still can’t be examined by the public.\nDocuments showing council’s current thinking and a brief history of its proposal for an EfW plant has been circulated to councillors. These documents reveal that fears which have often been expressed about the city’s recycling (how it does it and how much it does) and even bigger worries about incineration replacing recycling could well be justified.\nThe EfW plant was discussed at ITEM 5. Waste 2020 Programme- Energy from Waste Facility And Other Associated Works and Services Part of the discussion was to be “exempt”. The agenda item reads as follows, although the highlighting is mine:\n“In accordance with Standing Orders, Members are asked to determine whether the update report to be tabled at the meeting relating to agenda item 5. Waste 2020 Programme – Energy From Waste Facility which contains exempt appendices containing information relating to the financial or business affairs of a particular person (including the authority holding that information), as defined by Paragraph 3 of Schedule 12A of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1972, should be exempt and the press and public excluded from the meeting when these appendices are discussed or whether the public interest in disclosing this information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.”\nI asked from the public seating area that members be given the opportunity to vote on excluding members of the public because the chair seemed to be telling us to leave at the outset of ITEM 5 and without any vote. They were then allowed to vote. The chair also had to be persuaded by council officers that part of ITEM 5 could be discussed in public and that the exclusion could follow discussion of that part rather than apply to the whole item.\nHowever no discussion took place in this committee on the relative merits of the “public interest in disclosing” as opposed to the “public interest in maintaining the exemption” and it was not clear to me that members of the committee understood that standing orders provided them with an opportunity to debate the relative pros and cons of sharing the information with the public. The chair of the committee refused to let me raise this.\nThe public interest in disclosing is overwhelming in my view. I believe that this committee was led by its chair into a breach of its own standing orders by not having any debate about where the balance of public interest lay: whether it was better for the city to have disclosure or not. Members of the committee were simply not asked to contribute their thoughts on the subject or debate it before they were asked to vote.\nFor some members of the newly formed opposition (Independent/Labour) this was their first time sitting on this committee. I don’t know how they felt but I was in a state of mild shock by the time we were thrown out.\nPeterborough City Council’s call-in procedure\nrequires two members of a scrutiny committee to complete a form explaining the reasons for a call-in (eg failure to follow due process). The affected committee (the one within whose remit the decision takes place) then has to meet within 10 days to uphold the call-in or recommend action.\nOther councils’ procedures: Hackney Hertsmere Laudably, Thurrock Council provides for both its elected Members and the public to call-in these decisions prior to implementation.\nPeterborough has “suspended” its own call-in procedure on four occasions in 2005",

(It was one of two city centre roads which require moving to the wrong side of the roads and was a top local knowledge quiz question.) It was used by cyclists to EXIT Long Causeway onto Broadway. During recent new surfacing work, inexplicably the old route has been blocked off by a new bit of fence.\nLong Causeway is one way for vehicles but two way for cyclists.\nNo entry signs at the EXIT of Long Causeway don’t make sense, even to car drivers, who wouldn’t see them, if they were driving in the right direction. The road is one way for cars, (isn’t it?) which would be coming towards you in this picture. The only vehicular exit is via Cathedral Square. Which is behind you.\nOnly council permitted vehicles are allowed in past the rising bollards. Although they are not currently working, it looks as if a new monitor has been installed.\nAn exit is required onto Broadway for cyclists. At the moment cyclists are cycling straight past the completely pointless no entry sign and over the potentially rising bollards.\nIs the council planning to\n- reinstate the previous cycle route and remove the fence? This would separate cars from bikes and leave a favourite quiz question intact.\n- remove the no entry signs?\n- add a cycling contraflow sign (as at the roundabout end of Cowgate)? But if it is going to do this will it explain how it intends to ensure cyclists aren’t accidentally impaled on a rising bollard they haven’t noticed?\nWe did have a Council Leader who wanted to abolish cycling in the whole city centre. He lost his seat in May.\nWhile he is gone, I for one am hoping the Council will be able to resolve this particular road sign nonsense quickly, sensibly and constructively. And if whoever is responsible for traffic signs in the city wants to comment below, he or she is very welcome.\nThere is hope.

Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:",

He was responding to ‘the Mayor‘s review’ or, to give it its full name, ‘The review into Operation Span and the investigation of non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’ which has just been published. The next speaker was Rochdale Council leader Councillor Neil Emmott, the leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, who also apologised for what the council had got wrong.\nNext came three women, each of whom had headed up an organisation working with the thousands of (mostly female and very young) victims of human trafficking and sexual abuse.

The first woman had been through the barrier known as the end of one’s tether, her hair got in her way, and she was gasping for air and needed water, but she was clearly a warrior and won my respect for getting out in short order the horrible truths she needed to speak.\nThe second woman was wearing a very smart cream dress and had her hair and make up done: full Manchester female in armour, elegantly equipped equally for the dance floor, lifting someone up out of the gutter, or take her presentation to any board room or civic assembly rooms of the city prepared to listen to what goes on in the darkest corners of the city: where corruption, physical, emotional and psychological abuse and the systemic collusion of letting offenders go: the institutional joint enterprise (how come that is not an offence, she asks?) of deliberately letting known and identified criminals walk free.\nShe struck a line through the whole of the older Oldham predecessor report, revealing that during that investigation, only one victim had been able to speak to the reviewers. It’s people like her I want to see working where they can do what is needed: in the House of Lords.\nThen, just as the third woman, in a dark suit began speaking, she was rudely interrupted by a far more important man: Grant Schapps, talking about the state of the world and threats had multiplied and increased in severity during the horrible reign of his own ghastly Tory Party.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_05_17_my-bank-holiday-and-a-filthy-fire-eleven-days-later/content_598.html": "Last week on Wednesday morning I wrote a post to celebrate the council’s repairing some broken bonfire links on its website. I’d found them on the May Day Bank Holiday when I had described a filthy fire which had rather spoiled the day.\nAt midday that same Wednesday I heard from the Strategic Regulatory Services Manager:\n“I understand from my Colleague XXX that you have enquired as to why no out of hours Pollution Control Service is provided by the Council. The Council though having a duty to provide a Pollution Control Service has no legal responsibility to provide an out of hours service I am afraid, the decision as to the level of resources put into providing the service and the hours it operates is one in law for the Council to decide. The Council to my knowledge has never provided a out of hours service and has certainly not during the last 7 years.\nIn what is an extremely challenging financial climate difficult decisions have to be made with regards to service provision, and that does result in services Pollution Control being no exception having to operate within financial constraints. From both an efficiency perspective, looking at the most effective use of staff time, and a financial one, budgets having already been set for the year, it is not possible to provide an out of hours service in Peterborough this year.\nIt is appreciated that at times having an officer on call may be helpful to a member of public, officers are however still able through planned measures, to operate when necessary at different in order to gain evidence of any offences being committed. In recent times officers have been able to attend a site at a weekend following prior arrangements in order to observe an illegal bonfire which was known to take place regularly, evidence obtained resulted in the case being put before the courts.\nIn your particular case XXX will continue to liaise with you over the problems you are experiencing.”\nThis response confirms the absence of any out of hours toxic fire procedure. It suggests that the council is content with this situation. If, as happened on Monday, the fire service tells the resident that use of their emergency number is not appropriate, the resident has no way to get a toxic fire put out.\nThen on Friday I the Pollution Control Officer said:\n“Following our conversation earlier this week, I can now provide an update on the issue of the bonfire.\nI have spoken to XXX from the Fire Brigade and he is reasonably confident that following the warnings given both by him and his colleagues to the person on site and the Fire Brigade’s action in extinguishing the fire, the problem is unlikely to recur at this particular site.\nGiven this, the council have decided not to take legal action at this time. The reasons for this are as follows:\n- The most useful legislation for dealing with bonfires is the Clean Air Act. However this Act only applies to “trade or industrial premises” or to waste being burned at a site as part of a business’ activities. The premises in question is a domestic property and there is no evidence that the waste was part of the activity of a business – certainly the fire brigade do not believe any of it was brought to the site from elsewhere and the landlord is (at the moment) essentially the occupier of the premises as it is vacant.\n- For domestic properties, the primary legislation is the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), which has two main provisions that apply here: Statutory Nuisance and the requirements in relation to duty of care and proper disposal of waste.\n- Statutory Nuisance law is rarely applied in ‘one-off’ circumstances because it is much easier to prove the existence (or likely occurrence/recurrence) of a nuisance if it has happened more than once.\n- Burning waste such as that which was burned on Monday is against the provisions laid down in the EPA for the proper disposal of waste. However, the burden for the success of legal action on this would fall very much on yourself and the fire officer as given that no officer of the council witnessed the event (for reasons I hope XXX has explained in his email to you) our effectiveness will be limited.\n- Additionally, there are a number of tests that must be applied to any intended legal action in order to ascertain whether it is reasonable and proportionate and in the public interest. The council believe that prosecuting an individual for a first offence of this nature is not reasonable or proportionate and would not be likely to result in a particularly harsh penalty to act as a deterrent.\nFor these reasons, it is not felt that the time, effort and cost required in taking a case to court are justifiable. Yesterday a hand-delivered letter was issued warning of the potential consequences of any further occurrence. Please can you continue to monitor the situation, and should there be a recurrence of the problem we will investigate the likely occurrence of a nuisance.\nShould you have any further questions please do not hesitate to get in touch. …”\nI am suggesting that we need a working procedure open and available to anybody who wants to get a toxic fire put out and investigated outside the council’s working hours.\nAs things stand I must dial 999 even though the fire service doesn’t consider these events merit an emergency call.\nOne thought on “My bank holiday and a filthy fire – eleven days later”",

Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:\nLast week I visited Cambridgeshire’s newest foodbank, which opened a year ago in Ramsey. This visit formed one of a number of visits to the region’s growing number of food banks by members of the European Green Team in the run up to the European elections on 22nd May. Our team has reported on Hunger in the East.\nThe Ramsey foodbank is based at St Thomas a Becket on Ramsey High Street and it works as part of the network of Trussell Trust foodbanks which now serve no fewer than fourteen communities throughout Cambridgeshire.\n“I arrived with me lots of grand ideas and optimism. Less than a week before my visit I had been at the opening of a new food cooperative in Peterborough which has huge ambitions to change the way we shop and eat in the city. I am talking to growers and makers and I am often around people who jar and pot things.\n“When I arrived in Ramsey the market town sitting in an area of rich arable land was particularly green and beautiful, and lush with recent rain. The harsh realities of hunger in an area which is so very rich agriculturally brought me down to earth and made me think.”\nRev’d Gita Bond, who manages the Ramsey project explained that “The foodbank provides an emergency food supply for people without an income or on an income so low that they cannot afford food. Its clientele is identified by one of a dozen different agencies as in need of emergency food. They are issued with a voucher.”\nThe food bank relies on ongoing donations from parishioners and residents and it is also on the lookout for people who can deliver donations to people who are not mobile or who live further away.\nGita didn’t need to explain about the tea and biscuit which awaits volunteers: a group of people were talking and organising all manner of things around a busy and welcoming table. The church works with a wide range of community groups and there is a warm welcome for everybody.\nFoodbanks have proliferated because successive governments have failed and failed and failed again to tackle poverty wages.\nThe costs of living rise and people in work find their pay stands still and it is impossible to pay all the bills and put food on the table. People earning poverty pay are a growing part of those turning to food banks for help.\nPeople not in work for various reasons are more obviously vulnerable to hunger. But they are also victims of ideologically motivated and regressive government decisions.\nThe Green Party disapproves very strongly of the Department of Work and Pensions’ “sanctions” regime, which literally removes the welfare safety net from vulnerable claimants. Although a sanction can later be removed, a hunger gap opens up immediately. If the person falling into that hunger gap is lucky, they might get help from the foodbank.\n“Worries have recently been expressed to me that employees in the DWP may be being prevented by their line managers from identifying and referring people who need food immediately.”\n“We need an immediate change in government policy. Policy has gone back to before the second world war: we had malnutrition then and it is shameful that it has come back.\n“And on the ground, regardless of who gets elected on 22nd May, we need to figure out how we can improve our food resilience.\n“I was both impressed and horrified. I could see that almost all the food in the store is processed and packaged and it needs to be like that in order to have a reasonably long shelf life. Consequently there is nothing fresh at all. If someone donates something with a source of protein in it, such as a tin of fish or meatballs it can be issued. But if what is received is nutritionally unbalanced or poor, or all if all the donations are pasta, then that is all the foodbank can issue.\n“I suspect that what happens is that someone steps in: I bet it is someone with very limited means themselves, but it will be someone who cares. Communities work like this: but it is awful that they have to. But I am so very impressed with what they do manage to achieve despite the problems.\n“What I simply don’t understand is why we accept this system. Isn’t it insane for a country as wealthy as ours to function in this miserable way?\nThe Green Party is urging retail chains with outlets in the Ramsey area to make small regular donations of suitable items. A list is available from the foodbank.\n“But beyond these immediate calls for help, we are urging food processors to identify and minimise food waste. I sometimes hear about large amounts of perfectly edible food being dumped in Cambridgeshire: some of it destined for landfill (because it has been packaged and it is not worth unpacking it). Some of it goes for composting. In fact I heard a little while ago that on a farm close to Ramsey supermarket reject tomatoes were being composted. They might be the wrong colour or shape. This is not sustainable: this is not right.\n“It is high time we got this edible fresh food quickly to people who want and need good quality local food. I am perfectly happy to go and talk to a producer or a shop myself about what goes wrong in our broken food systems and how we can work to tackle hunger. I think the co-existence of food waste and hunger demonstrates that the food economy is not working efficiently. This is not good for consumers, but it doesn’t do any good to local farmers or food producers either.",

Smoke and smog affect visitors’ perceptions of the city as they step onto the platform and air quality has a serious and ongoing impact on residents’ health and wellbeing. Many people living in the city have actually forgotten what fresh air smells like: they are no longer aware they are living in smoggy conditions: they simply don’t smell the smoke any more. These fires (many of them illegal) are set in the evening, just as council officers go home and since they are usually “safe” (i.e. someone is supervising the fire and it isn’t getting out of control) the fire brigade is not required to take action.\nCouncil decided to approve, construct and launch (2016) its very own landfill waste incinerator with Cllr Kreling (on the planning committee at the time of approval) observing that if she couldn’t see anything coming out of the stack (the planning committee was taken on a tour of a similar monster), nothing was coming out. The council has never agreed to and is not live streaming data about its emissions from the stack.\nPeterborough Renewable Energy Limited who were the first to propose an incinerator for the city did agree to live stream their emissions data on their website. But this is not the incinerator which has gone live.\nThe Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor for East Ward, the ward with both planned incinerators sitting in it, offered to throw Richard Olive and me out of the council chamber She couldn’t throw us out because she couldn’t find a bailiff. But she was perfectly able to make a lousy decision without listening to evidence. For me, this was my introduction to the realities of politics in Peterborough. Most people have a vague sense of trust in their elected representatives. I lost whatever tiny bit I had left that day.\nBetween then and now council decided to knock down and pulverise numbers of large buildings made of brick, cement and plaster (Thomas Deacon School and several other predecessor-to-PFI schools, Bridge House, Peterborough District Hospital & assorted buildings on site). No dust suppression in place during the works and no coverage of the remaining mountains of dust (I observed the 20 ft high mountain of grey dust next to Aldermans Drive yesterday: 14th March 2016).\nThe Junction of Taverners Road with Bourges Boulevard is close to and downwind of the pile of pulverised sky scraper hospital and is also in a high density residential area. This junction is now close to breaching traffic pollution limits and that is according to official monitors. Are we surprised? Hardly. Cough Cough.\nIn London it has been shown that official monitoring is significantly understating the true state of affairs: http://cleanair.london/?s=monitorin…\nPeople feel there is nothing they can do. But there are a few things.\n- More people need to observe democracy in action, even if it does mean risking getting thrown out of meetings. The dishonour of getting thrown out is not yours.\n- We could choose not to reelect councillors who fail to help improve air quality and who drive themselves around in heavy overpowered diesel vehicles.\n- We could vote in councillors who don’t drive. Or who drive electric, hybrid and low emissions vehicles. The importance of leadership cannot be overstated.\n- We could vote in councillors who understand that a 20mph speed limit in Peterborough’s residential streets would make cycling and walking pleasanter and would reduce the number of journeys taken by car.\n- We could find a real time air pollution app which relies on independent air monitoring and which works in Peterborough, so that we are not obliged to rely solely on council owned data.\n- The council could live stream its incinerator emissions and on street air pollution monitoring data on its website. If it is proud of what it is doing, there should be no qualms in showing off its achievements.",

Ed claims the award has a dating problem and could therefore have been made ultra vires.\nI was so stunned by the way this was handled by the new mayor (legal advice or comment was not even sought) that I missed the exact words of the dismissal, but it was dismissed in about four words. Could have been “You can’t have that.” Over so quickly.\nBasically from the Spectators Gallery our council appeared not interested last night in defending itself in public against a charge it may have acted “beyond its powers”, i.e. unconstitutionally. Not only that, but on one of the most politically contentious areas of its responsibility: executive pay being a marker for escalating levels of inequality in society and in our organisations.\nWhereas various councillors sprang to support Harrington’s dismissed second motion (which by then was history), not a single councillor supported Ed Murphy’s assertion (either properly at the time or subsequently by way of solidarity or rhetorical effect – both options being wide open to them).\nIt seems to me that there are at least three possible explanations:\nWhich is it?

Follow Sustrans Peterborough on facebook. A member of the Werrington Running Club explained that the running club members use the bridge. While we were there the bridge was never empty: children were making their way to school: many pupils at Voyager school will get to school via this bridge and commuters were cycling and walking over it.\nOn top of the bridge, it ducks under the A47: the path descends a bit, making it an up and under bridge. It is an extraordinary design and in its day was very innovative. It is difficult to envisage a better design, given the continuous roar of traffic along the A47 crosses the Lincoln Road here: the main trunk route north out of Peterborough. Rhubarb Bridge (apparently so called because rhubarb kept coming up on its embankments when it was newly built) allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross two major roads on a set of off road, fully segregated paths, ramps and steps. There is absolutely no conflict with road traffic, which as things are, only stops for more road traffic.\nThe only road user who is not catered for, is (possibly) someone using a wheelchair or mobility scooter. There are ramps and they are certainly no steeper than many hills, but on the morning of our photoshoot, I did not see anyone attempt them in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter (which are very popular in Peterborough).",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_politics_page_4/content_711.html": "held in Park Ward on 16th April\nSome people were disappointed at the turnout at yesterday’s candidate hustings at the Willow Cafe in Park Ward, but top community activists tell me that “the people who turn up to things are the right people”.\nThe event was hosted by Park Streets Ahead Residents Association and hosted by Beki Sellick (in her capacity as Chair).\nI was making a cup of tea this morning and it dawned on me that there had been a disproportionately high number of sustainable transport professionals in the room. That speaks to ongoing safety and speeding issues in Park Ward and it tallies with despair on the doorstep that the well understood underlying problems persist unfixed. In fact if we rearranged the chairs in the room, we probably had the skills right there in the room to fix the problem. What these experts don’t have (as things stand) is the council’s ear. Once again, it is often the case that the solutions are not somewhere else: we’ve likely got them right here, in Park Ward.\nCandidates on the ballot paper turned up, with the exception of the Labour and Reform candidates.\n| ARFAN Khan | address is on ballot | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| ASIF Muhammad | (address in Peterborough) | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| HARDMAN Ian | address is on ballot | Liberal Democrat |\n| HUSSAIN Junayd | (address in Peterborough) | Labour & Co-operative Party |\n| MORRIS Sue | (address in Peterborough) | Reform UK |\n| RADIC Fiona | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| WILSON Steve | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| YASIN Sabra | (address in Peterborough) | Labour Party |\nThe full list for all wards is here.\nAttending in the audience, were just the right number of loud voices. True, many people didn’t say anything, but, for whatever reason, they decided not to speak.\nIt was not a scary event. There were no fights and I did not spot intimidation. However, I took one concern expressed to the host at face value and will catch up with this (and them) as and when I can.\nI have come across electoral malpractices including intimidation which is a known (but I believe increasingly historic) problem in Park Ward and it is one of the reasons why CCTV cameras are frequently installed outside some or all of Park’s polling stations. I am aware of various pressures which have been applied over the years to voters in Park Ward (they tell me about shocking things going on in the past). Most of these pressures are “normal” family, social or party influences and feelings of obligation, which are part of normal life and a functioning democracy. But once a person feels they are being bullied, losing their right to choose freely or even having their vote stolen, voters and candidates shouldn’t hesitate to call the police or Electoral Services at the council (who can work out what the problem might be and will liaise with the police if necessary).\nJohn Peach in the middle of the room does not (in my book) constitute intimidation: his body language and his Cheshire Cat grin said louder than words how much enjoyed the event (announced on the 5th), despite failing to invite his online newsletter readers (emailed on the 8th) across the ward to it. Probably a communication problem rather than a deliberate omission.\nThere was disappointment expressed by a couple of people at the event’s format, which was cabaret layout for the audience and mingling for candidates, designed to facilitate more personal encounters. The room has a lovely but hard floor so for the hard of hearing one speaker at a time would work, whereas two voices would blur each other out. There was a very good (but also very well resourced) accessible hustings held during Peterborough’s parliamentary by-election in 2019.\nIt is worth pointing out that the traditional format (high table at the top for the candidates and seats for the public arranged as if for a theatre show – like BBC Question Time) does allow for the person who wants to ask a question to take the floor and, if they want to, to command the room. This can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues . It also allows for a bit of tit for tat between candidates and lets them demonstrate (and develop and practice) any debating skills they have: very likely to come in handy if elected.\nThe event was recorded by an unknown individual at the back who didn’t ask permission or make himself known to the host. I have no idea if the recording will go anywhere: but I doubt it. Shout if you spot it.\nNobody took names of attendees or pictures. It was probably the least “posed” hustings I’ve attended and that makes a pleasant change.\nSo, in summary all good. Thank you Park Streets Ahead for the invitation. And well done, Beki Sellick for doing very well the incredibly tough job of chairing.\nI got a great deal out of attending and personally enjoyed it very much. I learned many things, including that when the awesome Rosemary was elected the youngest ever female councillor in Scotland, her campaign had focussed on housing and the position of wardrobes in bedroom layouts. Presumably at a time of massive council house building. I shall have to catch up with her again to find out more. Something else on the list for after the election.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_bridge-street/content_109.html": "This evening Cllr Darren Fower proposed a motion at Full Council. The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_freephilippa/content_165.html": "Today’s story about the jailing of Philippa by Judge Noble in Peterborough highlights several critical problems in Peterborough.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\nRanked with all the other parliamentary constituencies in the UK, the City of Peteborough is ranked fifth from the bottom. Bad driving is at epidemic levels in the city and around it. And given its appalling safety record, one has to ask why Judge Noble feels any need to conciliate the community of motorists living anywhere round here.\nThis is not Philippa’s fault either.\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\n4 Jan 2017",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_sustainable/content_66.html": "If you live in Park Ward and your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nI am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again. Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.",

As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.",

The incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small. Very effective UK legislation to tackle vote fraud is already in place. QED Vote fraud does not need new legislation.\nHowever imposing “voter ID” is highly likely to have undesirable, oppressive and discriminatory effects and our UK government and our MP know this. Because making it harder to vote suppresses the vote in groups which find things hard anyway.\nBut there would be no harm in raising voter awareness of vote fraud. Vote fraud can and has been effectively detected and prosecuted: here in Peterborough and elsewhere. In fact, anybody taking part in the electoral process can spot vote fraud and report it (as long as they know what to look out for). Moreover it is already a statutory responsibility of the police to protect our democratic systems. If you witness vote fraud while it is actually happening, call the police on 999. If you’ve seen it in the past, report it online. It is a crime, like any other. If our MP is aware of instances which have not been detected, reported and prosecuted, perhaps he could explain what advice he gave those who witnessed a crime and what the police did with all those reports?\nIf my MP believes that the incidence of what he believes is a problem is statistically higher than extremely rare in the UK or if a vote fraud has ever been shown to have influenced the result of an election, perhaps he or our new Police and Crime Commissioner could produce the evidence? Evidence of crime can overturn an election result in the UK, which is exactly as it should be. But while not having enough evidence to substantiate your case can be expensive when an accusation goes to court (as happened after Peterborough’s own 2019 by election) wasting his constituents’ time is not chargeable to our MP and even more unfortunately (given the urgency of what needs doing in parliament) no offence of wasting parliamentary time has yet been put on the statute book. Perhaps it should be?",

If these paid for and targeted facebook ads are indeed only showing up in Labour Party constituency voter feeds, as has been suggested, how can that be done without access to the electoral register, and if you have access to the electoral register, who provided it to you? and why don’t you have the courtesy to provide electors with an imprint (What’s that?

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough_page_10/content_743.html": "Yesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.",

The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\n- a statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\n- a statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\n- the revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\n- the loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\n- the loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\n- the exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\n- the exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\n- the exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\n- the possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\n- the likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\n- no plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\n- the awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\n- Leave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\n- Leave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\n- the growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.",

As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_fraud/content_44.html": "This post Brexit government seems remarkably keen to solve microscopic and even non existent problems. The incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small. Very effective UK legislation to tackle vote fraud is already in place. QED Vote fraud does not need new legislation.\nHowever imposing “voter ID” is highly likely to have undesirable, oppressive and discriminatory effects and our UK government and our MP know this. Because making it harder to vote suppresses the vote in groups which find things hard anyway.\nBut there would be no harm in raising voter awareness of vote fraud. Vote fraud can and has been effectively detected and prosecuted: here in Peterborough and elsewhere. In fact, anybody taking part in the electoral process can spot vote fraud and report it (as long as they know what to look out for). Moreover it is already a statutory responsibility of the police to protect our democratic systems. If you witness vote fraud while it is actually happening, call the police on 999. If you’ve seen it in the past, report it online. It is a crime, like any other. If our MP is aware of instances which have not been detected, reported and prosecuted, perhaps he could explain what advice he gave those who witnessed a crime and what the police did with all those reports?\nIf my MP believes that the incidence of what he believes is a problem is statistically higher than extremely rare in the UK or if a vote fraud has ever been shown to have influenced the result of an election, perhaps he or our new Police and Crime Commissioner could produce the evidence? Evidence of crime can overturn an election result in the UK, which is exactly as it should be. But while not having enough evidence to substantiate your case can be expensive when an accusation goes to court (as happened after Peterborough’s own 2019 by election) wasting his constituents’ time is not chargeable to our MP and even more unfortunately (given the urgency of what needs doing in parliament) no offence of wasting parliamentary time has yet been put on the statute book. Perhaps it should be?",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_news_page_4/content_573.html": "If you live in Park Ward and your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nI am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again. Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.",

We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.",

That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nthat the approved planning application according to which the block was to be constructed is 96/00001/FUL | Validated: Mon 07 Oct 1996 | Status: Decided\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nBehind the sheeting is sand. Here is similar material taken from a picture about a road being built on the construction company’s Facebook page. This may or may not be what is behind the steel sheeting too.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.\nOne thought on “Henry Penn Walk collapse a second update”",

The incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small. Very effective UK legislation to tackle vote fraud is already in place. QED Vote fraud does not need new legislation.\nHowever imposing “voter ID” is highly likely to have undesirable, oppressive and discriminatory effects and our UK government and our MP know this. Because making it harder to vote suppresses the vote in groups which find things hard anyway.\nBut there would be no harm in raising voter awareness of vote fraud. Vote fraud can and has been effectively detected and prosecuted: here in Peterborough and elsewhere. In fact, anybody taking part in the electoral process can spot vote fraud and report it (as long as they know what to look out for). Moreover it is already a statutory responsibility of the police to protect our democratic systems. If you witness vote fraud while it is actually happening, call the police on 999. If you’ve seen it in the past, report it online. It is a crime, like any other. If our MP is aware of instances which have not been detected, reported and prosecuted, perhaps he could explain what advice he gave those who witnessed a crime and what the police did with all those reports?\nIf my MP believes that the incidence of what he believes is a problem is statistically higher than extremely rare in the UK or if a vote fraud has ever been shown to have influenced the result of an election, perhaps he or our new Police and Crime Commissioner could produce the evidence? Evidence of crime can overturn an election result in the UK, which is exactly as it should be. But while not having enough evidence to substantiate your case can be expensive when an accusation goes to court (as happened after Peterborough’s own 2019 by election) wasting his constituents’ time is not chargeable to our MP and even more unfortunately (given the urgency of what needs doing in parliament) no offence of wasting parliamentary time has yet been put on the statute book. Perhaps it should be?",

There are many different types of electoral fraud including:\n- Vote buying\n- Intimidation\n- Ballot stuffing\n- Misrecording of votes\n- Misuse of postal or proxy votes\n- Destruction or invalidation of ballot papers\nWhat can I do?\nThere are simple steps you can take in order to prevent yourself falling prey to electoral fraud:\n- Keep polling cards and postal ballots safe at home , not allowing others to handle them at any time\n- If you arrive at the polling station and someone has voted in your name, notify the Presiding Officer. They will provide you with a tendered ballot allowing you to vote\n- When filling in postal ballots, do so alone.

It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough\nI emailed my MP and I said:\nI am writing to ask you to vote against the Government’s changes to the Infrastructure Bill on fracking that remove any guarantee that drinking water sources will be protected from fracking, and to call for an immediate fracking moratorium.\nThe changes made in the House of Lords weaken several of the 13 conditions accepted by Government in the House of Commons, including vital provisions to protect drinking water from fracking.\nPlease vote to ensure fracking is banned in all ground water source protection zones 1 – 3.\nAlthough these protections would make fracking safer, they cannot make it safe because fracking is inherently risky, and would exacerbate climate change.\nI am therefore asking that you call for an immediate fracking moratorium in the House of Commons. While the UK Government attempts to weaken the few protections we have, the rest of Britain is taking measures to protect the health of communities and the climate.\nI urge you call on Government to follow the lead of Wales and Scotland by bringing forward an immediate fracking moratorium so that the risks to health and climate change can be fully investigated.\nThe sooner we follow in the footsteps of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, New York State, Denton (Texas) – and the rest of Britain – by stopping fracking, the better for our communities, the climate and our local environment.\nYours Sincerely,\nFiona Radic\nDid Peterborough police arrest a homeless man…\n.. without reading him his rights?\nAre Peterborough cyclists cannibals now?\nI’ve blogged before about Peterborough and the attitude to cyclists held by the Leader of the Council and the centre of the city has just experienced “aggressive pavement cyclists” targeted by police. (I deplore the use of a word like “aggressive” to stereotype a wide community which cycles on pavements.)\nBut here we go again, this time with a word which suggests one superior tribe (maybe driving Chelsea tractors?) looking down on another primitive and uncivilised group (maybe all these things because they can’t afford a Chelsea tractor?).\nGiven that bicycles can’t really eat one another, I assume the police peep believes that the cyclists are stealing each others’ bicycles? I’m really not sure how such a useless assertion will help the police catch thieves. What I can tell the police is that this use of language is calculated to annoy cyclists with even the smallest bit of linguistic and political sensitivity. Like me.\nI wonder when Peterborough’s leading political and police peeps will make it into the twentieth century and or cycling enlightenment?\nFirst Spalding Road. Now Fletton Parkway!\nThe A16 from Peterborough to Spalding subsided and was closed (if I remember correctly before it opened) until remedial work was completed. It starts in Paston Ward and travels through Northborough Ward in the Peterborough unitary authority area (governed by Peteborough City Council).\nIt then enters the Lincolnshire County Council & South Holland District Council areas where it travels through county & district wards: Crowland & Deeping St Nicholas, Moulton (Weston and Cowbit) and Spalding St Mary’s\nIt also passes through the following parishes:\nNewborough, Borough Fen (Peterborough)\nCrowland, Cowbit, Weston and Spalding South (South Holland, Lincolnshire)\nIt travels through two parliamentary constituencies: that of Peterborough Borough and South Holland and the Deepings.\nThe Fletton Parkway is the A1139\nThe roadworks which are currently underway and which have hit a £4.5M size brick are within the following areas of local government:\nparliamentary constituency: North West Cambridgeshire\nunitary authority area: Peterborough City Council\nunitary authority wards: Orton Waterville, Orton Longueville and Orton with Hampton\nparishes: Orton Waterville, Orton Longueville (and an unparished area)\nFurther reading\nNew Listerner\nPeterborough Telegraph\n30th January http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/politics-news/contaminated-soil-and-new-works-land-city-council-with-4-5-million-roads-bill-1-6549612\nWas there a Clerk of Works?\nOh! Again. Check out the last frame!\nTo the best of my knowledge Clerk of Works is currently not a role within the organisation structure of Peterborough City Council (I can’t find the role on their website). Happy as always to be corrected.\nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST – FOI-14-0299 A1139 Fletton Parkway\nAlthough it looks from this document as if there were “site supervision and clerk of works functions” identified, it is clear that one contractor to the council appointed another contractor to the contractor to perform the roles. This is not the same as having one qualified person on one’s own team and begs the question who the possibly qualified person was. Happy as always to be corrected.\nIf Clerk of Works is the role which secures budgetary control (see above video), why isn’t Morson (the contractor apparently covering the role) picking up 100% of the £4.5M cost overrun? One way to establish the reason for this would be to subject the relevant contracts and subcontracts to scrutiny by a person competent in law of contract.\nPersonally, if I were the council I’d bring the role of Clerk of Works straight back in-house to establish and secure a clear line of responsibility and management. A good properly qualified person in this role could save the city a fortune over time. I know that breathtaking achievements (even if you only count the beans) are often made, quietly and without a brass band, by people doing this sort of job for other organisations.\nInformation on the history of the role of Clerk of Works within Peterborough City Council’s remit very welcome.\nMayor’s Charity Concert in Oundle Tonight\nThe Mayor’s Charity Concert begins at 7:45 tonight, Saturday January 17th at St. Peter’s Church Oundle.\nThe concert will showcase the talents of outstanding young performers, including previous winners of Oundle Young Musician of Year, Pianist Irena Radic & Cellist Ellen Porter and Daniel Dixon, 2014 Oundle Young Singer.

Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:",

Polling stations will be open from 7am to 10pm.\nIt is Thursday 2nd May. Please vote today. Polling stations will be open from 7am to 10pm.\nWhy does voting independent in Park Ward makes sense this year? Because what I said in my address to voters last year remains true this year: Park Ward has exactly the same problems. But this year we have even more challenges and we need to start by describing them honestly.\nLast year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nHowever, what I said last year about what needs doing in Park Ward has not changed. Park Ward still suffers from the same problems, so please re-read last year’s address. But this year I’m adding a couple of things:\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.",

It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.\nThis is what it looked like to another observer: http://parkfarmneighbourhoodwatch.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/childrens-centres-first-for.html\nHere is a photo of the opposition standing up to demand a recorded vote: http://terry-harris.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Full-Council-Childrens-Centre-Closures/G0000xzhmtuMp.a4/I0000UNVajRUjfiU\nBut the big question now is will Cabinet pay any attention at all to the wishes of Council when it meets on Monday at 10am?",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_09_24_council-or-bank-manager/content_419.html": "The city council claims to be under pressure to get its plans for Fletton Quays built. It is so anxious about this that it plans to decant itself from its own rather lovely Town Hall in Bridge Street so that it can rent out the space and encourage companies to join it on the other side of the river in a patch of land which would make a lovely river park or walkway and serve as a rain shed for the city, even a flood plain, if we were thinking in a truly sustainable way about what a river bank really is.\nThe nature of this pressure is not fully understood. At least I don’t understand it: I simply don’t share it, and given the amount of empty space available in the city, residential, retail and commercial, I admit to being bewildered.\nI am wondering also if the nature of the pressure is a bit more complicated and also whether the council isn’t so much being pressurised, as positively rushed into what could be a potentially very damaging decision. A decision is scheduled to be made at 10am on Monday morning. Are we sure we understand what the rush is all about?\nA few of us have been looking at the detail behind the company the council is planning to lend money to: Norlin Hotels Holdings Limited.\n(see: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/news/council/council-set-to-support-hotel-construction-on-fletton-quays/\nNorlin Hotels Holdings Limited turns out to be one of a huge network of companies and a couple of people have spent a day or two hunting for assets, a history of solid achievement, or anything to reassure us that this is a good thing. So far we haven’t come across much to reassure us. In fact warning lights are flashing everywhere.\nThe company is based in Northern Ireland. One of its directors is Stephen Brian Symington.\nWhy would Peterborough not opt for a local developer? Local builders? A local workforce? Is the company it is talking to really based in Northern Ireland, or is it just an address?\nI remember talking to people working on the academy building project and they told me that they came up from London every day by bus. One of the men I spoke to had only recently arrived from Africa which really got me thinking about the nature of the investment and exactly how it was managed and who benefited most from the choice of workforce. Looking back now, I wonder what would this man have done if his manager wanted to skimp on wall ties, for example? What were his skills? How well qualified was he? Was he in a position to probe something if it did worry him? Was his immigration status a problem for him? Could this put him in difficulties in negotiations with an employer? There is no evidence of a problem like the wall tie scandal happening in Peterborough, but a wall certainly did collapse for want of a few ties in Scotland. What complicated decisions led to that? We need to stop assuming that everything is done for our benefit and we need to start asking basic questions.\nWhat was the tender process? Who got involved?\nWho benefits from the decision to appoint a Northern Irish developer?\nWho is the developer? What do we know about them? Why is Peterborough, home of bricks, having to go so far to find a builder? Why is the council, which is so keen to focus on a “circular economy” not focussing locally and looking at people who have been educated and trained locally? Shouldn’t we be shortening the distances workers need to travel to find work?\nThen I see “Antigua” in an associated company’s name and I start thinking about tax havens. Quite a bit of Peterborough is now owned by offshore companies. This lowers the tax revenue available to central government. Has this got something to do with the city’s choice of company? What is the council’s approach to companies domiciled in a tax haven?\nAnd then since June it simply is not possible to ignore the heaviest political pressure on the Conservatives. Since the General Election, the Conservative Party has been and remains totally dependent on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to maintain its grip on power in Westminster. It is unlikely that the support is provided freely: the DUP is not known for being soft or a push over. Northern Ireland politicians will be trying to get as much out of this situation as they possibly can: and rightly so. But then, how exactly are they doing this? Could there be a party political aspect to the council’s choice of company? Is leverage being applied? If so is the council in a position to understand that sort of pressure, and to fully understand any risks which might be entailed?\nCould this really be all about moving money or debt around in ways which are made to be difficult to observe? As appears to have happened for entirely political reasons here.\nThe key issue is risk. What risks is the council running and has it got its eyes fully open to potential risks?\nI’ve spent the whole day (unpaid) searching for evidence that these two directors are experts in developing hotels. I haven’t found it. Others have had exactly the same experience. I’ve looked at all the active companies which have Symington or Irwin as a director. I’ve discovered that these two directors work closely together, that this set of companies is large and some are involved fun in the food industry, the racing sector, one or two are in the movie sector and that quite a few of them don’t file their accounts on time and several owe money to all sorts of financial institutions. Eastonville Investments Limited is controlled by a company based in the Cayman Islands, so I have no idea if the assets I was expecting to find are stashed safely and invisibly over there. I still think the organisation the council is talking to (which I still can’t really see as a functioning entity online – no website, for example or contact details) should be able to get a commercial bank loan if they have a viable business in our city, which I very very strongly doubt they do have, especially since they are hooked in to the old model of a hotel, rather than the fantastically popular AirB&B concept. The only company which has bothered with a website appears to be in biotech and has not thrived. Even if the hotel is a brilliant success, what impact will it have on the hotel sector already in the city? One hotel has already become infamous for housing Peterborough’s steadily growing homeless population. Is the Hilton chain really wanting to come to Peterborough?\nIf it goes wrong, the council will end up owing money against land it currently owns outright and owes nothing on, but which could fall dramatically in value in relation to any loaned amount borrowed against it. If that were to happen, the council tax payer will pick up the bill. Cllr David Seaton has honourably promised to resign if it does go pear shaped, but, frankly, resignation won’t cost him £15M.\nOne of the directors of Cawlands has demonstrated an ability to make the best of a very tough economic and political situation but however clever his recovery of property in a downturn was, I’m not sure that our council should be blowing the sort of bubbles into our local economy which could positively contribute to inflation of or a collapse in asset value.\nNor do I believe that our local council should in any way be in the business of baling out a bit of Northern Irish commercial property. The registered address of a network of companies, including the one which the council is proposing to deal with is 41-43 Waring Street, Belfast, County Antrim, BT1 2DY. And Waring Street Limited is also the name of a company. This is what that address looks like on google maps:",

It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_08_06_rhubarb-bridge-stakeholder-event/content_642.html": "An event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).\nOne thought on “Rhubarb Bridge Stakeholder Event”",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_05_07_what-happened/content_698.html": "Why did huge Photo ID queues build up so late on election night?\nAs a candidate, my job on election night is to wait for the ballot box to come in and to be present at the count. This is how candidates respect the voter’s voice. The ballot box contains the ballots and on their ballot papers are the choices of voters, speaking and expressing their wishes on the one day they are allowed to vote. Candidates observe their counts. We see what they say.\nThe first of Park Ward’s ballot boxes (Madeley House polling station) came in in reasonable time. The second ballot box (All Saints polling station) came in very late indeed, apparently owing to a long queue building up due to the Photo ID check. Queue tickets were issued to those in the queue at 10pm. This was clearly not expected to be a big thing by polling staff, who, when I left them had already been on duty for thirteen and a half hours, with only on-site breaks. The third ballot box (St Georges Hydrotherapy Pool polling station) did not arrive at the Town Hall until 1.30 am. I do not know how long polling staff had been at their posts by the time they were discharged from their duties, nor in what state they were. Polling staff are not permitted to leave the polling station while they are on duty and although they are all prepared for a 15 -16 hour shift, which is already an outrageously long working day, they certainly do not expect to be on duty very much beyond 10pm. I am wondering how many polling staff had to endure a 20 hour working day extending beyond Thursday 4th May into the early hours of the 5th.\nIt is true that PhotoID was trialled. But the very small trials were failures.\nUK government implemented the legislation despite the pilots’ failures.\nBallot boxes are normally handed over to the transport soon after 10pm and will usually arrive about an hour later. This year Peterborough City Council could not afford huge numbers of high security transit vehicles (the trucks looked like refrigerated container trucks) so some polling station staff at the eighty polling stations open at this year’s local election (there will be more polling stations for next year’s elections) will have had to wait for one of the five trucks waiting for a hold up somewhere else. I do not know how many polling stations were impacted by delays occurring in Park Ward. Nor do I know if other wards were themselves affected by late long queues.\nI cannot physically be in two places at once and all my team was already with me at the Town Hall. So, what I want to know is exactly what happened at the All Saints and St Georges polling stations. The advice I was given by polling staff was that the dinner time rush which usually starts between 5pm and 6pm was already dying down. Something clearly changed from the ward’s normal voting behaviour. How come? Why did such long queues form so late in the voting window?\nWere you in one of the queues? Please describe what happened.\nYou can comment below, or you can contact me privately.\nI’ve subsequently found out that that what looked like refrigerated transport trucks were there to provide temporary storage for the bulky furniture which had to be removed from the Town Hall rooms used for the count. (Forli, Bourges Viersen, Reception and Council Chamber.) Also that the ballot boxes arrived in count staff cars and had to queue around Car Haven Car Park.\nLikeLike",

Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:\nSeeing Green at Railworld: please register your interest\nThis event (originally blogged here on 1st May) has not happened yet. Jack Ginns came to talk to Peterborough in Transition on Monday evening and explained how sustainability was central to his enthusiasm for engineering and for transport and he discussed the history of Railworld in Peterborough and the Reverend Richard Paten’s conception of a centre for sustainable transport and lifestyles on the Railworld site.\nIt turned out that the initial idea Jack had had for a meeting about sustainability had grown into an all day event and that he was considering maybe splitting the themes into more, smaller events. So if you’d like to register your interest at what is still a future event or a series of future events, please send Jack your email address and he will add you to his mailing list.",

All of its committee members and officers do not claim a single penny for the work that they do and do not claim any form of expenses either.\nMANERP was formed in 2005 by residents who lived and people who worked work in the Millfield and New England in order to prevent the deterioration of the area because of the massive effect the influx of asylum seekers, refugees and EU migrants. The population had grown so quickly over a two year period that the infrastructure was failing to cope.\nThe Peterborough City Council agreed to recognise the group and its’ constitution was ratified and very quickly the association started to make representation to the council on several issues of concern.

Smoke and smog affect visitors’ perceptions of the city as they step onto the platform and air quality has a serious and ongoing impact on residents’ health and wellbeing. Many people living in the city have actually forgotten what fresh air smells like: they are no longer aware they are living in smoggy conditions: they simply don’t smell the smoke any more. These fires (many of them illegal) are set in the evening, just as council officers go home and since they are usually “safe” (i.e. someone is supervising the fire and it isn’t getting out of control) the fire brigade is not required to take action.\nCouncil decided to approve, construct and launch (2016) its very own landfill waste incinerator with Cllr Kreling (on the planning committee at the time of approval) observing that if she couldn’t see anything coming out of the stack (the planning committee was taken on a tour of a similar monster), nothing was coming out. The council has never agreed to and is not live streaming data about its emissions from the stack.\nPeterborough Renewable Energy Limited who were the first to propose an incinerator for the city did agree to live stream their emissions data on their website. But this is not the incinerator which has gone live.\nThe Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor for East Ward, the ward with both planned incinerators sitting in it, offered to throw Richard Olive and me out of the council chamber She couldn’t throw us out because she couldn’t find a bailiff. But she was perfectly able to make a lousy decision without listening to evidence. For me, this was my introduction to the realities of politics in Peterborough. Most people have a vague sense of trust in their elected representatives. I lost whatever tiny bit I had left that day.\nBetween then and now council decided to knock down and pulverise numbers of large buildings made of brick, cement and plaster (Thomas Deacon School and several other predecessor-to-PFI schools, Bridge House, Peterborough District Hospital & assorted buildings on site). No dust suppression in place during the works and no coverage of the remaining mountains of dust (I observed the 20 ft high mountain of grey dust next to Aldermans Drive yesterday: 14th March 2016).\nThe Junction of Taverners Road with Bourges Boulevard is close to and downwind of the pile of pulverised sky scraper hospital and is also in a high density residential area. This junction is now close to breaching traffic pollution limits and that is according to official monitors. Are we surprised? Hardly. Cough Cough.\nIn London it has been shown that official monitoring is significantly understating the true state of affairs: http://cleanair.london/?s=monitorin…\nPeople feel there is nothing they can do. But there are a few things.\n- More people need to observe democracy in action, even if it does mean risking getting thrown out of meetings. The dishonour of getting thrown out is not yours.\n- We could choose not to reelect councillors who fail to help improve air quality and who drive themselves around in heavy overpowered diesel vehicles.\n- We could vote in councillors who don’t drive. Or who drive electric, hybrid and low emissions vehicles. The importance of leadership cannot be overstated.\n- We could vote in councillors who understand that a 20mph speed limit in Peterborough’s residential streets would make cycling and walking pleasanter and would reduce the number of journeys taken by car.\n- We could find a real time air pollution app which relies on independent air monitoring and which works in Peterborough, so that we are not obliged to rely solely on council owned data.\n- The council could live stream its incinerator emissions and on street air pollution monitoring data on its website. If it is proud of what it is doing, there should be no qualms in showing off its achievements.",

Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair?

I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\n- lack of transparency (no figures available to the residents of Peterborough and – because I couldn’t ask my second question the audience was able to rest secure in the assumption – to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) himself.\n- treatment of farmers (I’ll expand for him here: the council’s first communication to 18 farmers was to warn them that they would be evicted if the plan went ahead)\n- risk of a change in the subsidy regime: no safety plan if the government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) changes the regime governing ROCs (again no discussion: no explanation)\n- no contingency fund if the sums are wrong\n- conflict with government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) policy on renewables (this was not explained at all)\n- has no plan B (if I may expand any decent proposal presents alternatives, preferably a well thought out range of options)\n- didn’t even know which brownfield sites it owned\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough_page_9/content_739.html": "Update 2: The two men who died between Yaxley and Farcet\nMy blog was partly about the alienating effect of cars and our road infrastructure and understanding why car parks and bridges over roads are chosen by suicidal (women, most often). As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\nMy January 2015 post received quite a bit of feedback and I realised that I was wrong about what the remedy is. Or at any rate that what I believed I meant was capable of being misunderstood. So, I don’t believe that the city needs a Clerk of Works any more. I believe that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works. I didn’t update my blog at the time (I often don’t) but now that the issue of budgets and management of major infrastructure projects at Peterborough City Council will be making headlines again, I am correcting my recommended solution so as to make absolutely clear to decision makers what I believe Peterborough needs.\nI learned last year that technically – i.e. on paper, legally, contractually and presumably somewhere in its accounts spreadsheet the council can actually claim to “have” a Clerk of Works. But also that (astonishingly) that function is currently performed by an employee or employees of the contractor doing the job and is not necessarily even a single nameable person. It may be “contractually normal” to organise a clerk of works function like this: I am told it is. But to my mind it is a notion, provided in the contract, but where it sits in any practical sense and who performs the function and why these persons unknown’s first loyalty should be our council and how the council can hold them accountable (for example by sacking them) is all shrouded in mystery. So a Clerk of Works is effectively useless: like a button floating free of the shirt, as it were.\nI believe now that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works who must be a member of Peterborough City Council’s staff, on their payroll and their payroll only and 100% and solely accountable to Peterborough City Council. I believe that role should be filled by a highly qualified person (i.e., they might have at least one civil engineering degree). They should be paid a professional and competitive salary and that the job should be advertised publicly and include local advertisements and the appointment process should be open to scrutiny within the council’s audit and compliance procedures.\nThe In House Clerk of Works I envisage would be supported by a planning department within the city council with immediate access to council archives and records. It is not good enough for planning staff to be located in one place and the documents in another. It is very difficult for members of the public to cope with the current system. How members of staff cope with using it on a daily basis beats me. I remain suspicious about how the Fletton Parkway contaminated land managed to come as a surprise to the Fletton Parkway Widening Project team:\nThe In House Clerk of Works should be empowered to scrutinise and halt any and all jobs done for the council at any stage in the application, approval and completion processes and to withhold sign off and payment until all the council’s quality standards are met. I hate seeing money being spent on works which are shoddy and unpleasing to the eye and hearing about decisions which nobody realised were as bad as they were at the time.* It does nothing for our local environments, which we pay good money to empower our councils to improve. And it does even less for our self respect as a city.\nIncidentally, taking down a wood or removing a green space is not a neutral act. In an Environment City you’d expect it to be considered especially controversial. But in addition to basic ecological concerns, woodland has long been used to conceal problems with the soil. Where you can’t grow a crop, farmers and landowners will often grow trees which will perform all sorts of useful functions within a landscape. Perhaps the cost of removing these particular patches of woodland and scrub will teach Peterborough to respect its green spaces and what they are actually doing a little more? We are often told by people who don’t realise we depend upon it and that we live in it that we “can’t afford” the environment. Perhaps this wacky but all too widespread reasoning informed the decision to widen Fletton Parkway? But in the city with the highest dependency on cars, it is likely that a £6M overspend (on top of what was originally budgeted) will be seen as “unavoidable” and “necessary”, because building a bigger road network remains at the uncontested top of Peterborough’s spending priorities.\n*For example:\nthe decision to turn one third of the A1139 parkway lights off and damaging whole lengths of under road cabling in the process, leaving a lethal bright stretch followed by a dark stretch, a bright stretch and another dark stretch. This light and dark lighting phenomenon (particularly noticeable near Stanground) happened all around the city because decision makers failed to check with the relevant qualified electrician what the impact of removing those particular light bulbs would be. In order to put it right all the affected lengths of road would have to be dug up.\nFlute Concert at 1pm at St John The Baptist in Cathedral Square, Peterborough\nThis concert is the third in a summer concert series organised by St Johns CIC. Hannah Clark will be joined by Irena Radić. Both of these young musicians have given concerts at St John’s before. In their début appearance here together Hannah Clark (flute) and Irena Radić (piano) will play music by Fauré, Ravel, Reinecke, and more…\nThe church will be open from about midday and arriving early ensures time for a homemade cake or a coffee. All profits go to The Green Backyard.\nThe concert will begin promptly at 1pm. Admission is free, but those who are able to afford it are asked to make a donation. The suggested amount is £4.\nYou can also spend some time with the magnificent textile work, Mapestry, installed in St John’s as part of this year’s magnificent PECT Green Festival. Mapestry will be in the church for a short while, and then it will tour the route of the River Nene which passes through the city. The work consists of twelve delightfully characterful panels, each one describing a month in the year and a place on the Nene. The work has been created by Froglife a major wildlife charity based in Peterborough and a number of community crafters. Nenescape is a Heritage Lottery funded Landscape Partnership Scheme conserving and protecting the Nene Valley’s natural and built history. Get in touch with them if you think you can help. A woman in a red dress is walking her dog in Ferry Meadows:\n“Peterborough needs The Broadway Theatre, it does not need more flats. Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.\nA petition launched apparently launched three weeks before Thursday’s decision of the UK electorate to Leave the EU has garnered over three million signatures since Thursday as I write at half past ten on Sunday morning.\nSomeone asked me:\n“I have 5 friends sharing this. The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\na statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\na statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\nthe revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\nthe loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\nthe loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\nthe exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\nthe exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\nthe exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\nthe possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\nthe likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\nno plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\nthe awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\nLeave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\nLeave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\nthe growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.\nI thought I’d share a couple of thoughts. The first is about “counting agents”. There was a recount for Fletton & Stanground called by UKIP, who were only three votes away from winning third place. The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.\nAttended\nJohn Peach CON\nBeki Sellick LD\nMohammad Yousaf CON\nAli Shan GREEN Absent but sent apologies\nRichard Ferris LAB\nArfan Khan CON\nJohn Shearman LAB\nGraham Whitehead UKIP Absent and no apology received (or read out)\nSabra Yasin LAB\nThis account is a transcription of my notes, intended solely for me and makes no pretensions to completeness.

The incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small. Very effective UK legislation to tackle vote fraud is already in place. QED Vote fraud does not need new legislation.\nHowever imposing “voter ID” is highly likely to have undesirable, oppressive and discriminatory effects and our UK government and our MP know this. Because making it harder to vote suppresses the vote in groups which find things hard anyway.\nBut there would be no harm in raising voter awareness of vote fraud. Vote fraud can and has been effectively detected and prosecuted: here in Peterborough and elsewhere. In fact, anybody taking part in the electoral process can spot vote fraud and report it (as long as they know what to look out for). Moreover it is already a statutory responsibility of the police to protect our democratic systems. If you witness vote fraud while it is actually happening, call the police on 999. If you’ve seen it in the past, report it online. It is a crime, like any other. If our MP is aware of instances which have not been detected, reported and prosecuted, perhaps he could explain what advice he gave those who witnessed a crime and what the police did with all those reports?\nIf my MP believes that the incidence of what he believes is a problem is statistically higher than extremely rare in the UK or if a vote fraud has ever been shown to have influenced the result of an election, perhaps he or our new Police and Crime Commissioner could produce the evidence? Evidence of crime can overturn an election result in the UK, which is exactly as it should be. But while not having enough evidence to substantiate your case can be expensive when an accusation goes to court (as happened after Peterborough’s own 2019 by election) wasting his constituents’ time is not chargeable to our MP and even more unfortunately (given the urgency of what needs doing in parliament) no offence of wasting parliamentary time has yet been put on the statute book.

I suppose this information will eventually be published in the council’s very own minutes, but who ever reads those?\nSo, since several people have asked for a breakdown, here are my gleanings from the Spectators Gallery:\nCON Arculus, Nick ABSTAIN West\nCON Casey, Graham ABSTAIN Orton Longueville\nCON Lee, Matthew ABSTAIN Fletton\nCON Maqbool, Yasmeen ABSTAIN West\nCON Simons, George ABSTAIN Paston\nCON Sanders, David name heard but unable to hear response Eye & Thorney\nCON Allen, Sue name not heard Orton Waterville\nCON Cereste Marco name not heard Stanground Central\nCON McKean, Dale name not heard Eye & Thorney\nCON Walsh, Irene name not heard Stanground Central\nCON Dalton, Matthew NOT VOTING West\nCON Day, Sue NOT VOTING Paston\nCON Elsey, Gavin NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Fitzgerald, Wayne NOT VOTING Bretton North\nCON Goodwin, Janet NOT VOTING Orton Longueville\nCON Harper, Chris NOT VOTING Stanground East\nCON Hiller, Peter NOT VOTING Northborough\nCON Holdich, John (OBE) NOT VOTING Ghinton & Wittering\nCON Kreling, Pam NOT VOTING Park\nCON Lamb, Diane NOT VOTING Glinton & Wittering\nCON Nadeem, Mohammed NOT VOTING Central\nCON Nawaz, Gul NOT VOTING Ravensthorpe\nCON North, Nigel NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Peach, John NOT VOTING Park\nCON Rush, Brian NOT VOTING Stanground Central\nCON Scott, Sheila NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Seaton, David NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Serluca, Lucia NOT VOTING Fletton\nCON Stokes, June NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Thacker, Paula NOT VOTING Werrington South\nCON Todd, Marion NOT VOTING East\nCON Over, David NOT VOTING Barnack\nLAB Forbes, Lisa FOR Orton Longueville\nLAB Jamil, Mohammed FOR Central\nLAB Johnson, Jo FOR East\nLAB Khan, Nazim (MBE) FOR Central\nLAB Knowles, John FOR Paston\nLAB Martin, Stuart FOR Bretton North\nLAB Shabbir, Nabil FOR East\nLAB Shearman, John FOR Park\nLAB Thulbourn, Nick FOR Fletton & Woodston\nLAB Murphy, Ed FOR Ravensthorpe\nLAB Sylvester, Ann FOR Bretton North\nLD Fower, Darren FOR Werrington South\nLD Sandford, Nick FOR Walton\nLD Shaheed, Asif FOR Walton\nLD Davidson, Julia name heard but unable to hear response Werrington South\nPIF Miners, Adrian declared interest, so unable to vote Dogsthorpe\nPIF Ash, Christopher FOR Dogsthorpe PIF Fletcher, Michael FOR Bretton South\nPIF Fox, John FOR Werrington North\nPIF Fox, Judith FOR Werrington North\nPIF Harrington, David FOR Newborough\nPIF Saltmarsh, Christabel FOR Dogsthorpe\nPIF Sharp, Keith FOR North\nPIF Swift, Charles (OBE) FOR “but confused” North\nPIF Lane, Stephen name not heard Werrington North\nI found it very difficult indeed to pick up the voices of the Conservative councillors last night. It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_09_15_yet-another-overspend-at-fletton-parkway-peterborough/content_287.html": "An eye watering overspend by Peterborough City Council on the Fletton Parkway widening project was revealed back in January 2015. Now nearly another million pounds is being added to that total.\nIn January 2015 I blogged and said then that what the council needed was a Clerk of Works. It turned out that I was wrong.\nMy January 2015 post received quite a bit of feedback and I realised that I was wrong about what the remedy is. Or at any rate that what I believed I meant was capable of being misunderstood. So, I don’t believe that the city needs a Clerk of Works any more. I believe that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works. I didn’t update my blog at the time (I often don’t) but now that the issue of budgets and management of major infrastructure projects at Peterborough City Council will be making headlines again, I am correcting my recommended solution so as to make absolutely clear to decision makers what I believe Peterborough needs.\nI learned last year that technically – i.e. on paper, legally, contractually and presumably somewhere in its accounts spreadsheet the council can actually claim to “have” a Clerk of Works. But also that (astonishingly) that function is currently performed by an employee or employees of the contractor doing the job and is not necessarily even a single nameable person. It may be “contractually normal” to organise a clerk of works function like this: I am told it is. But to my mind it is a notion, provided in the contract, but where it sits in any practical sense and who performs the function and why these persons unknown’s first loyalty should be our council and how the council can hold them accountable (for example by sacking them) is all shrouded in mystery. So a Clerk of Works is effectively useless: like a button floating free of the shirt, as it were.\nI believe now that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works who must be a member of Peterborough City Council’s staff, on their payroll and their payroll only and 100% and solely accountable to Peterborough City Council. I believe that role should be filled by a highly qualified person (i.e., they might have at least one civil engineering degree). They should be paid a professional and competitive salary and that the job should be advertised publicly and include local advertisements and the appointment process should be open to scrutiny within the council’s audit and compliance procedures.\nThe In House Clerk of Works I envisage would be supported by a planning department within the city council with immediate access to council archives and records. It is not good enough for planning staff to be located in one place and the documents in another. It is very difficult for members of the public to cope with the current system. How members of staff cope with using it on a daily basis beats me. I remain suspicious about how the Fletton Parkway contaminated land managed to come as a surprise to the Fletton Parkway Widening Project team:\nThe In House Clerk of Works should be empowered to scrutinise and halt any and all jobs done for the council at any stage in the application, approval and completion processes and to withhold sign off and payment until all the council’s quality standards are met. I hate seeing money being spent on works which are shoddy and unpleasing to the eye and hearing about decisions which nobody realised were as bad as they were at the time.* It does nothing for our local environments, which we pay good money to empower our councils to improve. And it does even less for our self respect as a city.\nIncidentally, taking down a wood or removing a green space is not a neutral act. In an Environment City you’d expect it to be considered especially controversial. But in addition to basic ecological concerns, woodland has long been used to conceal problems with the soil. Where you can’t grow a crop, farmers and landowners will often grow trees which will perform all sorts of useful functions within a landscape. Perhaps the cost of removing these particular patches of woodland and scrub will teach Peterborough to respect its green spaces and what they are actually doing a little more? We are often told by people who don’t realise we depend upon it and that we live in it that we “can’t afford” the environment. Perhaps this wacky but all too widespread reasoning informed the decision to widen Fletton Parkway? But in the city with the highest dependency on cars, it is likely that a £6M overspend (on top of what was originally budgeted) will be seen as “unavoidable” and “necessary”, because building a bigger road network remains at the uncontested top of Peterborough’s spending priorities.\n*For example:\nthe decision to turn one third of the A1139 parkway lights off and damaging whole lengths of under road cabling in the process, leaving a lethal bright stretch followed by a dark stretch, a bright stretch and another dark stretch. This light and dark lighting phenomenon (particularly noticeable near Stanground) happened all around the city because decision makers failed to check with the relevant qualified electrician what the impact of removing those particular light bulbs would be. In order to put it right all the affected lengths of road would have to be dug up.\nthe Eye roundabout design (which now has more pedestrian casualties than anywhere else in the city)",

To date he has not honoured me with a response.\nMonday 22 April 2024\nDear Paul Bristow,\nPension restitution for women born in the 1950s\nAlthough with the exception of The Right Honourable Sir Julian Lewis MP, Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, I note that you yourself and your fellow Conservative MPs have agreed – or been whipped – not to support EDM 243 https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/61723\nPlease can you explain why you are not supporting full pension restitution for a group of women, many of whose first parliamentary votes are likely to have been for Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to be elected Prime Minister and during whose first term, The United Kingdom signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1981 (later ratified in 1986).\nPERSONAL DETAILS PARA REMOVED\nI believe 50’s born women are owed full restitution.\nPERSONAL DETAILS SECTION REMOVED But it is my opinion that the UK workforce is less motivated and has less to look forward to by entering paid employment now than at any time in my life. You might like to have a word about what motivates people with the one person who has signed the EDM. With what was a presumably successful career in His Majesty’s armed forces, maybe he could give you a view on how a monstrous injustice followed by a huge breach of trust would impact morale in the services. I would be astonished if he and I could not agree on that.\nWill you reconsider your own and your party’s position, please?\nIt was close. After the Conservatives insisted on two recounts and then insisted on yet another check, the Park Ward result was finally agreed some time after three o’clock this morning. I got to bed at 4am. The full results for the Peterborough City Council elections are here. Votes for the first First Past The Post Police and Crime Commissioner election are still being counted.\nI am extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me and who supported me in this election. Everything you did means a lot. Thank you so very much.\nFor me, the campaign I was most concerned about was the one run by Kirsty Knight to retain her seat and I congratulate her very very warmly on achieving this despite having made a tough and gutsy decision to leave the Green Party just a few weeks prior to the election. Kirsty has almost certainly broken another election campaign record and she has certainly set an excellent precedent for Peterborough. Thank you everyone who has supported Kirsty.\nIt was noticeable to me that a couple of newbie Liberal Democrat candidates also won with remarkably short campaigns. Hats off to both of them too.\nI feel for Nick Sandford who has to continue to perform his duties as Mayor (until the Mayor making ceremony) despite losing his seat last night. I know he’ll see the funny side, but still. While Peterborough elects in thirds, surely, most years, the Mayor doesn’t have to be someone facing election in the same year? It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?\nA succession of disappointing Conservative governments have left the UK with an extraordinary number of groups with very substantial grievances. One group consists of about 3,800,000 women who were born in the 50s.\nI was. Were you?\nIf not, you’ll know a few. Please support the campaign for full restitution to UK women born in the 1950’s. Please share this post and please join me. I have taken these two simple actions:\nJoin me and write to your MP Explain to your MP what this increase in pension age has meant to you. Check first whether or not your MP has already signed in support of EDM 243 The motion is “That this House welcomes the positive interventions from so many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have suffered pensions loss through the targeting of their pension rights; pays tribute to constituents and campaigners in their ongoing fight for justice; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory laws; and encourages the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to join mediation, noting there are no impediments to doing so.” If your MP hasn’t, please, when you write, ask your MP to sign EDM 24.\nNothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nAs if Voter ID wasn’t enough, this year brings a new voting complication\nVoters delivering their votes by hand to the Town Hall may be surprised this year by the notices stapled to the doors warning them NOT to post their ballots in the Town Hall letter box without a “return form”. This is a new rule! A new form! Nothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nThe government has added yet another risk to voting postally. There are others, including postal delivery delays (extremely big risk at the moment), rejection of ballot due to signature or date not being matched (very small risk in my opinion, but still a risk), mislaying the pack from the council, theft of the pack or the ballot paper from someone who is vulnerable, someone who is being bullied, or someone who doesn’t understand or care (very big risk indeed).\nIncidentally, it is forbidden for candidates to handle anyone else’s postal packs or ballots. They should only ever handle their own. If a candidate or anyone you don’t trust completely offers to take your vote for you, please report it. You might be experiencing a crime and the council will check it out for you.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: it doesn’t look any better than it smells.\nThames Water’s creditors face a massive haircut if this Conservative government decides, despite its Conservative privatisation ideology, that it turns out to be the best organisation to put right the very stinky mess which Conservative deregulated private business ideologies seem to have combined to let of a utility company make.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: this doesn’t look any better than it smells, unless you happen to be a bond trader with money to flush.\nMeanwhile, global temperatures carry on breaking records. March was the eleventh consecutive month in which global sea and air temperatures broke records.\nWhy does voting independent in Park Ward makes sense this year? Because what I said in my address to voters last year remains true this year: Park Ward has exactly the same problems. But this year we have even more challenges and we need to start by describing them honestly.\nLast year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nBig Bins – outside flats and shops\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nHealth & Education services struggle with residents who move\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nResources for Roads\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.\nThis year I am standing as an independent candidate in Peterborough\nPolice and Crime Commissioner, Peterborough City Council and several parish council elections will be held on Thursday 2nd May. But this time, I am standing in Park Ward as an independent politician. This means that I can set my own campaign priorities and ignore group think and party lines. If elected, I would be free to vote only for those policies and decisions which would improve the lives of my constituents and which I personally agreed with.\nI supported Councillor Kirsty Knight’s successful Green Party campaigns last year. This year she is fighting to retain her seat for the first time as an independent councillor. This takes great courage and I respect her hugely for her decision. I endorse, am supporting, and will continue to support Kirsty after what I very much hope will be another victory and another campaign first. Please vote for and support Kirsty, who in her first term has already established herself as an outstanding city councillor.\nCollette Francis (who campaigned energetically for the Bretton Oak Tree and joined the Greens) is also standing in West as an independent candidate. As a serving parish councillor interested and competent in paperwork and planning, I am confident Collette will make a superb city councillor. Please vote for and support Collette.\nLastly, thank you to all those who have helped and tried to help during the past few months. I have heard every word and I appreciate all you have done and said. Thank you.\nPlease get in touch to support my campaigns, or those of Collette or Kirsty\nWho is observing, and who is maybe not even noticing the visible and costly effects of climate change in Peterborough? A clue might have landed on your doormat.\nI walked through Central Park recently and realised that nearly every single box had died. I took a couple of photos intending to write to the council and promptly forgot.\nThen, thanks to Angus Ellis I received a useful reminder. Thank you, Angus.\nThe reminder arrived in the form of a Labour and Co-operative Party leaflet suggesting I vote for Angus who is this party’s candidate in Park Ward. It dropped on my doormat and I eventually got round to reading it. I discovered a very rare picture of Park Ward Councillor Mohammed Samir (who, along with another Ravensthorpe councillor is not profligate with his words or his image) at the bottom right of page three. And even more surprising, there, in front of his frown and rising up the bank behind him is scorched, brown and dead or dying box hedging, telling every sharp eyed reader in Park Ward the very sad story about its own highly likely extinction.\nWeather conditions are increasingly brutal and this pattern of intemperate weather (part of our new, not so temperate climate) is particularly cruel to box, a key evergreen parks and gardens hedging plant. Long periods of extreme drought alternating with non stop record rainfall will have stressed this along with many other plants, including many of Central Park’s trees.\nSlowly, since 2007 when it was first recorded in the UK, the box moth has been travelling north (it began its very long journey somewhere in South East Asia!) and here it is: rampaging across Peterborough. It noticed it in my garden only last summer. It probably reached the park before that.\nI wrote to the council this morning to ask that the dead box bushes are dug out. A very sad job for those who tended them. It used to be good gardening practice to burn diseased and infested plants. These days, hot composting (we have brown garden bins for that in Peterborough) will probably do the job of disinfection.\nI have also been thinking about what needs doing in Central Park to deal with the loss of the lovely robust evergreen structure which the box has provided for many years around Central Park’s beds and along paths. Evergreens are particularly important in winter, when so many plants are bare.\nReplacement structural evergreen hedging can’t be planted safely in Spring or Summer (October is the very earliest sensible time) and until then at the earliest, removing dead plants will open the beds up to unwanted foot traffic: both pet and human.\nFast growing decorative annual flowers might have time to provide protective ground cover until a decision is made on whether and how to replace.\nI would be very surprised if there is one plant which could do what the extraordinary and now at risk box did for all the park’s flower beds, since the conditions in each bed are increasingly varied: some are very very dry (memorial gardens) and others around the outer path are shady and one or two occasionally waterlogged. Decisions could be complicated.\nSeeding with forget-me-not (on damper beds) and/or nasturtium (round the top of the dry memorial garden).\nAnd if a decision is made to retain hedge type edging, which plants might work well in the various conditions to be found in different beds around the park?\nI think that rosemary might work around the memorial garden. It doesn’t mind neglect and drought and responds to drought by flowering (all year round!!) if dry. It doesn’t mind being on a bank which will lose rainwater. It can be clipped (min twice a year) into a very beautiful and sturdy box type hedge. But it probably shouldn’t go in straight away: there will be too much box moth around and it’s definitely a second choice target!",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_news_page_8/content_729.html": "I have asked people why the council hadn’t gone all out to fund a replacement bridge as soon as it realised Rhubarb Bridge was suffering an unusual degree of decay. This would have made sense, especially since there are national funding pots for sustainable travel infrastructure, and this bridge might well have qualified.\nSince then I have I received one really useful reply. My interlocutor pointed out to me that the money for repairs and maintenance comes out of the Revenue pot at the council. Revenue is for running costs, costs which recur year after year. The money for the an surface roundabout or for a replacement bridge would come out of the Capital pot. Capital is for one off costs, for buying or building assets such as buildings and infrastructure.\nThis made me think. Pressure on the Revenue pot is extreme. And it might be this extreme funding pressure which is leading to a decision not to maintain. If it replaces an an annual maintenance bill with a one off capital bill (with arguably a smaller ongoing maintenance cost), it will be relieving pressure on the funds which are needed to look after people in extreme need.\nFunding pressures on local government affect their Revenue funding primarily. Pressure on capital funding is not as bad. Revenue funds are used to fund social care, road repairs and waste disposal. It is this funding stream which is under impossible strains as central government imposes its Austerity measures and renders all our services less and less able to cope. So all local authorities have to balance roads and waste against social care. It is quite clearly insane, but until we sack the government as we are entitled to do at each general election, there is no sign of a change in this wicked situation. And local authority roads get a small fraction of the maintenance money which Highways England gets to maintain trunk roads. Unfortunately Rhubarb Bridge does not belong to Highways England. It belongs to the council.\nThis leaves a number of items which haven’t been accounted for: lets call them uncounted elephants in the room:\nThe likely cost of accidents at an at surface crossing. It is clear that this has not been factored in. There is clearly an increased risk of impacts on emergency, hospital and care services budgets.\nThe impact of being at ground level at an air pollution hot spot on all pedestrian and cyclists using the route. The higher you are the less likely you are to be inhaling high concentrates of particulates. The closer you are the more certain it is. In pushchairs children are face to face with exhaust pipes and this is just one reason (of many) why parents pop them in what seems to be the safer environment of a car.\nThe at surface crossing will result in cyclists taking to the road, rather than wait.\nThe at surface crossing will result in people getting into a car in preference to walking with a pram or pushchair.\nAnd it leaves my original question standing: why the council hasn’t tried to get hold of (let us add “capital”) funding to rebuild the bridge – if it is beyond economic repair?\nAn event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).\nI attended an event last Thursday which was about Rhubarb Bridge, but before I post anything about that, this is just a little news about the next bridge over the A47 going east (towards Wisbech). This bridge is on Highways England’s list of repairs and should be getting some much needed attention very soon. I hope it isn’t closed for long. It is certainly not planned for demolition. It is a useful bridge enabling cyclists and pedestrians to shortcircuit (North /South) one of Peterborough’s oddest and most confusing roundabouts over and onto the A47 (as it goes East/West).\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nPlease let me know if I have been incorrectly advised.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nIf whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so promptly, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity and (unfortunately now) your stated personal approval (I think you may have done this in some ignorance of the gravity of what has been alleged – I know you are a very busy man).\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well. It is important that the Andy …\nIn her own words: “I welcome the news that Andy Coles has resigned from his post as Cambridgeshire’s Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner. I would like to know …\nColes did resign quickly and in terms of media coverage in a sudden and media-spectacular way from his post as Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner but he did this on the basis that the allegations were getting in the way of him performing the role, not on a point of principle or honour. I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nA list is available below the video on this post.\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him. It is reasonable that he is suspended. It is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while these dreadful allegations remain unresolved.\nPeterborough Green Party supports the continued use of the Spectators Gallery as what it says on this notice:\nSpectators Gallery sign in Peterborough Town Hall showing the way up four flights of stairsand the door leading to it from Bridge Street. #OpenTheDoor (locked last Wednesday).\nPress Coverage of Coles’ resignation from his PCC role\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned following allegations that he deceived … Cambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy Coles resigns.\nThe allegation relates to Andy Coles‘ work as an undercover police officer in the 1990s. … Cambridgeshire’s deputy PCC resigns over ‘sex deceit’ claim.\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned after being accused of deceiving a woman into a sexual relationship while he was an undercover officer.

It is where the Conservative Party stand the candidates they really don’t want to risk losing. Brian Mawhinney (eventually CON Party Chairman) was MP for Peterborough but was moved to the neighbouring North West Cambridgeshire constituency when Peterborough started to look a bit too risky.\nA “safe” seat presents a number of challenges to residents but also to opposition parties, one of which is that voters who know their vote “doesn’t count” (in terms of securing democratic representation) are inclined to think that their vote “isn’t counted” (but watch this video to see why this is an entirely different thing!).\nIn British Columbia, Canada, Green leader Andrew Weaver agrees a deal with NDP’s John Horgan to end unfair first-past-the-post voting and bring in a proportional system\nHey ho. We are entering the final stages of a general election campaign which looks like cementing our out-of-date two party system in place for at least another five years.\nLabour have failed to put a proportional voting system into its manifesto. Despite calls from many in his party, Jeremy Corbyn has stuck to his script that he does not need it to win, nor does he want it – oh and he can win the Green’s only seat in Brighton. So Labour are asking for your vote on the basis of maintaining the unfair voting system which has given us a majority of “safe seats”, expenses scandals, indifference to voters and all the rest of it.\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party. The Liberal Democrats have made Beki Sellick its prospective candidate, but it has not yet been publicly confirmed.”\n11/5/17 16:00 deadline to withdraw a validly nominated candidate",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_politics_page_7/content_731.html": "The city council claims to be under pressure to get its plans for Fletton Quays built. It is so anxious about this that it plans to decant itself from its own rather lovely Town Hall in Bridge Street so that it can rent out the space and encourage companies to join it on the other side of the river in a patch of land which would make a lovely river park or walkway and serve as a rain shed for the city, even a flood plain, if we were thinking in a truly sustainable way about what a river bank really is.\nThe nature of this pressure is not fully understood. At least I don’t understand it: I simply don’t share it, and given the amount of empty space available in the city, residential, retail and commercial, I admit to being bewildered.\nI am wondering also if the nature of the pressure is a bit more complicated and also whether the council isn’t so much being pressurised, as positively rushed into what could be a potentially very damaging decision. A decision is scheduled to be made at 10am on Monday morning. Are we sure we understand what the rush is all about?\nA few of us have been looking at the detail behind the company the council is planning to lend money to: Norlin Hotels Holdings Limited.\nNorlin Hotels Holdings Limited turns out to be one of a huge network of companies and a couple of people have spent a day or two hunting for assets, a history of solid achievement, or anything to reassure us that this is a good thing. So far we haven’t come across much to reassure us. In fact warning lights are flashing everywhere.\nThe company is based in Northern Ireland. One of its directors is Stephen Brian Symington.\nWhy would Peterborough not opt for a local developer? Local builders? A local workforce? Is the company it is talking to really based in Northern Ireland, or is it just an address?\nI remember talking to people working on the academy building project and they told me that they came up from London every day by bus. One of the men I spoke to had only recently arrived from Africa which really got me thinking about the nature of the investment and exactly how it was managed and who benefited most from the choice of workforce. Looking back now, I wonder what would this man have done if his manager wanted to skimp on wall ties, for example? What were his skills? How well qualified was he? Was he in a position to probe something if it did worry him? Was his immigration status a problem for him? Could this put him in difficulties in negotiations with an employer? There is no evidence of a problem like the wall tie scandal happening in Peterborough, but a wall certainly did collapse for want of a few ties in Scotland. What complicated decisions led to that? We need to stop assuming that everything is done for our benefit and we need to start asking basic questions.\nWhat was the tender process? Who got involved?\nWho benefits from the decision to appoint a Northern Irish developer?\nWho is the developer? What do we know about them? Why is Peterborough, home of bricks, having to go so far to find a builder? Why is the council, which is so keen to focus on a “circular economy” not focussing locally and looking at people who have been educated and trained locally? Shouldn’t we be shortening the distances workers need to travel to find work?\nThen I see “Antigua” in an associated company’s name and I start thinking about tax havens. Quite a bit of Peterborough is now owned by offshore companies. This lowers the tax revenue available to central government. Has this got something to do with the city’s choice of company? What is the council’s approach to companies domiciled in a tax haven?\nAnd then since June it simply is not possible to ignore the heaviest political pressure on the Conservatives. Since the General Election, the Conservative Party has been and remains totally dependent on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to maintain its grip on power in Westminster. It is unlikely that the support is provided freely: the DUP is not known for being soft or a push over. Northern Ireland politicians will be trying to get as much out of this situation as they possibly can: and rightly so. But then, how exactly are they doing this? Could there be a party political aspect to the council’s choice of company? Is leverage being applied? If so is the council in a position to understand that sort of pressure, and to fully understand any risks which might be entailed?\nThe key issue is risk. What risks is the council running and has it got its eyes fully open to potential risks?\nI’ve spent the whole day (unpaid) searching for evidence that these two directors are experts in developing hotels. I haven’t found it. Others have had exactly the same experience. I’ve looked at all the active companies which have Symington or Irwin as a director. I’ve discovered that these two directors work closely together, that this set of companies is large and some are involved fun in the food industry, the racing sector, one or two are in the movie sector and that quite a few of them don’t file their accounts on time and several owe money to all sorts of financial institutions. Eastonville Investments Limited is controlled by a company based in the Cayman Islands, so I have no idea if the assets I was expecting to find are stashed safely and invisibly over there. I still think the organisation the council is talking to (which I still can’t really see as a functioning entity online – no website, for example or contact details) should be able to get a commercial bank loan if they have a viable business in our city, which I very very strongly doubt they do have, especially since they are hooked in to the old model of a hotel, rather than the fantastically popular AirB&B concept. The only company which has bothered with a website appears to be in biotech and has not thrived. Even if the hotel is a brilliant success, what impact will it have on the hotel sector already in the city? One hotel has already become infamous for housing Peterborough’s steadily growing homeless population. Is the Hilton chain really wanting to come to Peterborough?\nIf it goes wrong, the council will end up owing money against land it currently owns outright and owes nothing on, but which could fall dramatically in value in relation to any loaned amount borrowed against it. If that were to happen, the council tax payer will pick up the bill. Cllr David Seaton has honourably promised to resign if it does go pear shaped, but, frankly, resignation won’t cost him £15M.\nNor do I believe that our local council should in any way be in the business of baling out a bit of Northern Irish commercial property. The registered address of a network of companies, including the one which the council is proposing to deal with is 41-43 Waring Street, Belfast, County Antrim, BT1 2DY. And Waring Street Limited is also the name of a company. This is what that address looks like on google maps:\nAt the time “Jessica”‘s story broke, I expected people in Peterborough who knew the gregarious and popular Cllr Andy Coles to experience shock and there has been a little of that. That is why I wrote about the sensation of falling which is how the shock of the allegations first affected me.\nI have been too busy out and about campaigning to write much about this story but while I’ve been busy a great deal has happened. This post is an update and a pulling together of threads.\nThe council can’t do anything\nFirstly in response to a number of points and questions I communicated to the council’s leader and chief executive officer, the council has explained its position with respect to removing an elected representative:\n“The legal position is that all democratically elected councillors, are entitled as of right to attend all meetings of full council. There is no power for officers or members to remove that right.”\nSo while “Jessica” believes that Coles should resign as a city councillor (and I wholeheartedly support her call) I don’t think that anybody can force that to happen. If Coles continues not to resign, it seems that he can’t be pushed.\nHis party won’t do anything\nI believe that a decent political party would have suspended Coles already, pending clarification of his situation. However his party is the Conservative Party which is in power and which has been close to being in power for a century. It is an integral part of the establishment which has used the police to target over 1,000 organisations, including my own political party, my party’s only MP and my party’s only member of the House of Lords. This is why I personally have no expectations that the Conservative Party will even worry about behaving decently: that simply isn’t what the party or the British establishment is about. They are about power full stop. If they did suspend or expel him I would expect him to opt to remain in post as an independent councillor. This may be more of a worry to them than his remaining in post. The horrible question which then arises is where are the other 120 ex spy cops and how do their current networks, contacts, employments or appointments help to protect their secrets and abuses or those of others and to what extent and how might such arrangements be tolerated or even organised? Let’s not underestimate the usefulness of professional, political and cultural networks. Cllr Coles is one of the best connected people in Peterborough.\nThree investigations are underway: none of which stop him talking\nBack to fast moving present reality. There are now three investigations or cases ongoing. As far as I am aware none of these require Coles to maintain silence on the allegations: his silence is entirely a matter of personal choice, not of contractual or legal obligation. I am as ever happy to be corrected.\nwhich at first glance looks as if the IPCC is not investigating and did not investigate. But if you check what the IPCC does and how it does it, it is perfectly possible that this interpretation is not quite correct. IPCC can supervise local investigations without actually doing them. This statement does not eliminate the possibility that it could be involved in supervising a Cambridgeshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (Cambridgeshire OPCC or here just OPCC) investigation which hasn’t started yet. As for regulations, here is something which may or may not help in understanding what they are and what will or won’t happen next.\nIn order to understand what has or hasn’t happened here, it would be necessary to see both referrals and to form a judgement about their sufficiency or otherwise. It would also be necessary to understand whether these referrals relate only to Coles’ behaviour while he was applying for or occupying the post of Cambridgeshire Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner (as I strongly suspect is the case).\nMeanwhile the local paper indicates that the Cambridgeshire OPCC has delegated the investigation to the Cambridgeshire Police & Crime Panel. This body meets next on 6th September. The agenda for that meeting is not yet online, but it should be available on the 1st at the latest.\nWe really do need to know what Coles’ motives were in going for the role of Deputy PCC and we need to know everything about who knew the whats and the whys about that appointment.\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nPlease let me know if I have been incorrectly advised.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nIf whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so promptly, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity and (unfortunately now) your stated personal approval (I think you may have done this in some ignorance of the gravity of what has been alleged – I know you are a very busy man).\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well. It is important that the Andy …\nIn her own words: “I welcome the news that Andy Coles has resigned from his post as Cambridgeshire’s Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner. I would like to know …\nColes did resign quickly and in terms of media coverage in a sudden and media-spectacular way from his post as Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner but he did this on the basis that the allegations were getting in the way of him performing the role, not on a point of principle or honour. I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nA list is available below the video on this post.\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him. It is reasonable that he is suspended. It is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while these dreadful allegations remain unresolved.\nPeterborough Green Party supports the continued use of the Spectators Gallery as what it says on this notice:\nSpectators Gallery sign in Peterborough Town Hall showing the way up four flights of stairsand the door leading to it from Bridge Street. #OpenTheDoor (locked last Wednesday).\nPress Coverage of Coles’ resignation from his PCC role\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned following allegations that he deceived … Cambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy Coles resigns.\nThe allegation relates to Andy Coles‘ work as an undercover police officer in the 1990s. … Cambridgeshire’s deputy PCC resigns over ‘sex deceit’ claim.\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned after being accused of deceiving a woman into a sexual relationship while he was an undercover officer.

It is where the Conservative Party stand the candidates they really don’t want to risk losing. Brian Mawhinney (eventually CON Party Chairman) was MP for Peterborough but was moved to the neighbouring North West Cambridgeshire constituency when Peterborough started to look a bit too risky.\nA “safe” seat presents a number of challenges to residents but also to opposition parties, one of which is that voters who know their vote “doesn’t count” (in terms of securing democratic representation) are inclined to think that their vote “isn’t counted” (but watch this video to see why this is an entirely different thing!).\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

This visit formed one of a number of visits to the region’s growing number of food banks by members of the European Green Team in the run up to the European elections on 22nd May. Our team has reported on Hunger in the East.\nThe Ramsey foodbank is based at St Thomas a Becket on Ramsey High Street and it works as part of the network of Trussell Trust foodbanks which now serve no fewer than fourteen communities throughout Cambridgeshire.\n“I arrived with me lots of grand ideas and optimism. Less than a week before my visit I had been at the opening of a new food cooperative in Peterborough which has huge ambitions to change the way we shop and eat in the city. I am talking to growers and makers and I am often around people who jar and pot things.\n“When I arrived in Ramsey the market town sitting in an area of rich arable land was particularly green and beautiful, and lush with recent rain. The harsh realities of hunger in an area which is so very rich agriculturally brought me down to earth and made me think.”\nWHY EMPTY KITCHEN CUPBOARDS IN RAMSEY?\nRev’d Gita Bond, who manages the Ramsey project explained that “The foodbank provides an emergency food supply for people without an income or on an income so low that they cannot afford food. Its clientele is identified by one of a dozen different agencies as in need of emergency food. They are issued with a voucher.”\nThe food bank relies on ongoing donations from parishioners and residents and it is also on the lookout for people who can deliver donations to people who are not mobile or who live further away.\nGita didn’t need to explain about the tea and biscuit which awaits volunteers: a group of people were talking and organising all manner of things around a busy and welcoming table. The church works with a wide range of community groups and there is a warm welcome for everybody.\nFoodbanks have proliferated because successive governments have failed and failed and failed again to tackle poverty wages.\nThe costs of living rise and people in work find their pay stands still and it is impossible to pay all the bills and put food on the table. People earning poverty pay are a growing part of those turning to food banks for help.\nPeople not in work for various reasons are more obviously vulnerable to hunger. But they are also victims of ideologically motivated and regressive government decisions.\nThe Green Party disapproves very strongly of the Department of Work and Pensions’ “sanctions” regime, which literally removes the welfare safety net from vulnerable claimants. Although a sanction can later be removed, a hunger gap opens up immediately. If the person falling into that hunger gap is lucky, they might get help from the foodbank.\n“Worries have recently been expressed to me that employees in the DWP may be being prevented by their line managers from identifying and referring people who need food immediately.”\n“We need an immediate change in government policy. Policy has gone back to before the second world war: we had malnutrition then and it is shameful that it has come back.\n“And on the ground, regardless of who gets elected on 22nd May, we need to figure out how we can improve our food resilience.\n“I was both impressed and horrified. I could see that almost all the food in the store is processed and packaged and it needs to be like that in order to have a reasonably long shelf life. Consequently there is nothing fresh at all. If someone donates something with a source of protein in it, such as a tin of fish or meatballs it can be issued. But if what is received is nutritionally unbalanced or poor, or all if all the donations are pasta, then that is all the foodbank can issue.\n“I suspect that what happens is that someone steps in: I bet it is someone with very limited means themselves, but it will be someone who cares. Communities work like this: but it is awful that they have to. But I am so very impressed with what they do manage to achieve despite the problems.\n“What I simply don’t understand is why we accept this system. Isn’t it insane for a country as wealthy as ours to function in this miserable way?\nCALL TO RETAIL CHAINS TO HELP\nThe Green Party is urging retail chains with outlets in the Ramsey area to make small regular donations of suitable items. A list is available from the foodbank.\n“But beyond these immediate calls for help, we are urging food processors to identify and minimise food waste. I sometimes hear about large amounts of perfectly edible food being dumped in Cambridgeshire: some of it destined for landfill (because it has been packaged and it is not worth unpacking it). Some of it goes for composting. In fact I heard a little while ago that on a farm close to Ramsey supermarket reject tomatoes were being composted. They might be the wrong colour or shape. This is not sustainable: this is not right.\n“It is high time we got this edible fresh food quickly to people who want and need good quality local food. I am perfectly happy to go and talk to a producer or a shop myself about what goes wrong in our broken food systems and how we can work to tackle hunger. I think the co-existence of food waste and hunger demonstrates that the food economy is not working efficiently. This is not good for consumers, but it doesn’t do any good to local farmers or food producers either.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_solar-eclipse/content_130.html": "Tag: solar eclipse\nHow to watch the solar eclipse 1) safely and 2) online\nHere is some advice below from the Royal Astronomic Society (www.ras.org.uk) on how to observe the eclipse safely: https://www.ras.org.uk/images/solar_eclipse_leaflet.pdf If you want to view it on line (say if there is heavy cloud), you could use one of the links below which will be providing a live stream: http://new.livestream.com/accounts/8724297/events/3807156/player?width=560&height=315&autoPlay=true&mute=false http://live.slooh.com/stadium/live/the-total-solar-eclipse-of-2015 http://www.solareclipse2015.org.uk/live-webcast/ https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=solar+eclipse+2015+live+streaming\nWill anybody in Peterborough see tomorrow’s solar eclipse?\nFor a second day running it has not been possible to see the sun in Peterborough at 09:30. I had made a note to check where it would be on Friday (tomorrow) when there is a chance to witness a near total solar eclipse. People have made plans and some have plotted parties and bought cameras, filters, projectors and protective eye wear, ready for the big day.\nInstead we have “fog”. This is a polite word for particulate laden and polluted air. It might be a lot more accurate to call it “smog”. Yesterday it almost lifted just after lunch and shafts of sunlight penetrated into the city centre. Today we have what looks like heavy cloud. But it is more likely that the smog has simply floated up a bit. The government website is predicting worse pollution levels on Friday than today.\nI joined the Green Party in 2007 as I tried to reverse Peterborough City Council’s decision to support the incineration of domestic waste. This was a battle which we campaigners lost. We saw a neighbouring proposal fall in the face of a far more successful campaign. Lessons were learned, as they say. And I started to consider the vexed question of what exactly drives politics in Peterborough.\nA key supporter of incineration of waste is Cllr Marco Cereste (he is also a director of Peterborough Renewable Energy Limited which builds slightly cleaner incinerators than the one the council is building). As leader of the council he personally attracts huge amounts of anger, frustration and suspicion: some of it reasonable, some of it less so. But in the last couple of weeks he has told the story of his signing (on behalf of the city he represents) a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on his facebook profile (shared with his facebook friends). This MoU is with an entity locals understand is a Chinese government funded organisation, possibly what we’d call in the UK, an “NGO” (non governmental organisation).\nThen in an online discussion elsewhere entirely about this morning’s fog, someone shared this video which I hadn’t come across previously. The story of this video’s making and removal from Chinese social media is available online. I just wish that we’d had this video at the time the council’s decision was still not made. At the notorious moment when Pam Kreling (then one of the councillors making the crucial decision about whether or not to use incineration) said words to the effect that if she couldn’t see anything emerging from a stack, then there was nothing there and there was by implication nothing which could do anyone any harm. As campaigners we weren’t allowed to speak at critical moments in meetings: in fact the chair of one of the meetings offered to have me and Richard Olive thrown out when we stood up to tell them they were being hopelessly misinformed by their advisors. But as I observed this pantomime (there was no beadle to implement the Chair’s desire) I was left reeling from a deeper revelation. I still wonder how people in key positions got through even basic level schooling, what exactly went on in their science lessons and what their marks were.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_cambridgeshire/content_309.html": "but I did not expect to enjoy a real life murder related story based near Peterborough.\nDid you watch the finale of #24hoursinpolicecustody#Victoria Breeden’s calculating, targeted and persistent behaviour demonstrates how anyone can be a perpetrator of domestic abuse.\nThere are quite a few all too dreadful crimes connected with our area, some of them still under investigation, but I hadn’t come across this particular one prior to spotting the drama documentary in the tv schedule. I gritted my teeth and started watching, expecting at best a bit of a civic heads up for me. It looked as if it was going to be grim.\nI used to go to the odd police panel (they preceded the introduction of the PCC) and here you can read my previous blogs about the new role of Police and Crime Commissioner and its disastrous roll out in Cambridgeshire (the quality of candidates selected for election by the Conservatives has been terrible). Sitting through meetings (whether they are community based panels or the meet-the-latest-commissioner-in-the-town-hall type) does give you some insight into what issues the police face and how their priorities are decided. So I know exactly why Mr Plod isn’t strolling down my street in his size elevens any more – but unlike many people I don’t have a problem with that.\nBut this docu-drama gives everyone stuck at home and not at all interested in going to meetings a view onto what police work is really like.\nIt turned out to be riveting. I am a huge fan of detective fiction on the telly. Obviously this isn’t fiction: anything but. But the story had me on the edge of my seat and nobody watching it needs to know a single thing about Sherlock, Miss Marple or Morse.\nHats off to everybody who helped put the case together and then: just as remarkable, the story about the investigation. Not easy at all. Well done. Cambridgeshire is really good at the investigation of abuse: one of the toughest and least well understood let alone appreciated aspects of policing.\nLocal Greens are helping voters to get Green Party councillors elected onto Peterborough City Council. You can vote Green all over Peterborough. We raise money to pay for leaflets so that local people know they can vote for us. You can vote Green in Peterborough and North West Cambridgeshire constituencies. This all costs money.\nContrary to what the public assumes, our activists work for free: they volunteer. If you can’t volunteer, a financial contribution is the quickest and most effective way to support us. Back our Crowdfunder now.\nNorth West Cambridgeshire is a historically extremely safe seat. It is where the Conservative Party stand the candidates they really don’t want to risk losing. Brian Mawhinney (eventually CON Party Chairman) was MP for Peterborough but was moved to the neighbouring North West Cambridgeshire constituency when Peterborough started to look a bit too risky.\nA “safe” seat presents a number of challenges to residents but also to opposition parties, one of which is that voters who know their vote “doesn’t count” (in terms of securing democratic representation) are inclined to think that their vote “isn’t counted” (but watch this video to see why this is an entirely different thing!).\narrive 6.30pm for a 7pm start in the Main Hall at Peterborough Regional College\nThis hustings is hosted by the Peterborough Telegraph and Peterborough Regional College. Peterborough’s newspaper says: “Time is running out to be in the audience as the candidates aiming to be MP for Peterborough after June’s general election go head-to-head at a hustings run by the Peterborough Telegraph and Peterborough Regional College.\nThe hustings is on Friday, May 26 from 7pm to 9pm (6.30pm entry) at the regional college’s hall at its Park Crescent campus.\nTo be in the audience, email your name and any questions for candidates to joel.lamy@jpress.co.uk or ring 01733 588728.”\nThe confirmed candidates are Stewart Jackson (Conservative), Fiona Onasanya (Labour), Beki Sellick (Liberal Democrat) and Fiona Radic (Green Party).\nPeterborough Regional College\nIf you are arriving on foot or bicycle, head to: Park Crescent, Peterborough, PE1 4DZ. There is some space to park around the park on Park Crescent, but if you are arriving by car you might find more space by using the college’s Eastfield Road vehicle entrance and follow signs to the college car parks.\nJames Palmer is the Conservative candidate expecting to be crowned Mayor of the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on May 4th. Yesterday he admitted that the two cities of Cambridge and Peterborough have not received “tangible government investment”:\n“If the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough can be as successful as they are at the moment, without any tangible government investment over the last 30 to 40 years, think what they can achieve with tangible investment.”\nThis is a startling admission from any Conservative party member at a time when the country is led by his own party and the vast majority of councillors across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are Conservatives. Cambridgeshire is a deep blue area with North West Cambridgeshire traditionally being the Conservative’s safest seat. So what have our hard working elected representatives been doing over the past 30 to 40 years?\nPalmer sees Mayor role as similar to Fairy Godmother\n“He talks about spreading both “the gold dust of Cambridge” and “the Cambridge bubble” to the rest of the county.”\nIt is true that money comes into Cambridge, but does he know how it is got there? Maybe not if he thinks of it as “gold dust” or a “bubble”. ITV claims that Cambridge has “emerged” as a “start-up hub”. Does the media, does Palmer know how important the university is to this “emergence”? Does Palmer know how important the university’s global reputation is in enabling this to be engineered, by does he know how many people? Has he put a value on it or is he relying on the wand of some fairy godmother or (let’s not be sexist) maybe a fairy godfather? Has he investigated the effect of current government policies on the university? And on the population and the huge range of businesses which surround and relate to the university?\nLast time I door knocked in Cambridge I encountered the distress of overseas but non EU postgraduate students who were being targeted by Theresa May, then Home Secretary. Suddenly this group, which pays a premium to come here, were not being allowed to stay in the UK beyond the submission of their theses. (By the way that premium they have been paying has helped universities survive a period of catastrophic underfunding.) Previously postgraduates would hang on for a while, until they had got their next studentship or research position was sorted out: it was a key breathing space for them after a sustained period of hard concentrated study during which they could network and write applications. They would then move on to a new period of study or work which might be anywhere in the world. Failing to support students at critical moments for them is also failing to support the university. This suggested to me at the time a lack of understanding of the environment provided for research by universities and a lack of knowledge about how career paths open up for people in and around universities. Some of those paths include enterprise and innovation, the words Palmer uses, but I don’t think he has a clue how these things happen. Basically it is his own party which is blowing away the magic gold dust.\nAnd the problem is not just one for overseas students. Now that UK students have to take out loans to study, many of the best students will choose not do so in order to try to remain debt free or because they would like to buy a house at some point in the future. Student debt will not help in either endeavour. This affects all universities very badly and is a punch below the belt to universities and colleges who were trying to open up admissions to all sections of society. This is very slow work in a society still divided by class and money and the university sector did not need a setback like this. Slowly admissions are closing to sections of society which were already less well represented in UK universities. Because talent can and does pop up literally anywhere, over time this will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage when compared to institutions based in more inclusive societies. The character of the UK student will change over time, as those with more risk averse personalities simply won’t go. The children of those who have not paid back – or not been able to pay back – their student loans will be locked out from being awarded a student loan. (I believe this may already be happening). Financial dependency is not a good seed bed for intellectual freedom and the flowering of ideas which in turn give birth to breakthroughs and sometimes a realisable innovation. Dependency enslaves the mind as well as the body. It is Palmer’s own party which decided to do this to the UK student and it is his party which continues to do this. This is why I have no time for a Conservative fairy godmother.\nPalmer doesn’t get Peterborough\nThis article has been published in Peterborough’s one and only local newspaper. I’ll give him this: he doesn’t even pretend to understand Peterborough.\nPalmer doesn’t talk about rural issues\nGiven a background as a Soham councillor and in farming, leaving out rural topics is odd. Palmer doesn’t mention them. Isn’t this his strong suit? Perhaps he thinks that Peterborough is all urban. Big mistake: Peterborough is partly rural. Unfortunately the city is split between two parliamentary constituencies each with large rural hinterlands. It is these rural areas which traditionally keep Conservatives in power. Even the unitary authority area (which includes the city part of both constituencies) takes in a large rural area. The magical fairy dust which does work round here (but to date only for the Conservatives) is electoral boundaries. There are many unsympathetic developments in the pipeline in villages and on green belt. The mayoral role Palmer is standing for comes with significant powers to push plans through despite local decision making. Palmer comes from the countryside but doesn’t mention the countryside. As I said, odd.\nPalmer doesn’t get the relationship between Cambridge and Peterborough\nThis is really why I sat down to write this.\nWhen are people going to stop apologising for Peterborough?\n…and stop behaving as if Peterborough was the poor neglected cousin of Cambridge? Palmer fell into this one, just like all his Tory colleagues keep doing and have been doing, probably since the eighteenth century. Further back, when the church was the biggest power in the land, Peterborough also fell foul of diocesan power struggles. Having a cathedral hasn’t stopped the city being passed about from county to county. Paradoxically this is a key strength: Peterborough is used to being on the border of everywhere else and it doesn’t enjoy being bossed about. It likes looking after itself. Doesn’t mean it is good at it, mind.\nBut, back to Palmer:\n“So could Fletton Quays be discussed in the same breath as Facebook? Maybe not, but under Mr Palmer’s vision Peterborough will not be seen as a poor neighbour of Cambridge, but a dynamic city doing big business with the rest of the world.”\nFacebook was of course born in a university. It was designed for students, by a student. For those who don’t know Peterborough Fletton Quays is a place by the Nene where grain was landed, stored and moved on and the city council is demolishing everything down there, ready to rebuild and move itself there, in order to encourage others to do the same (see Alconbury, this post). Yes: there is a dig here, but Peterborough already does business with the rest of the world. We’ve done it for a while. We kept Europe in bread after peace was declared in 1945. Peterborough’s was a massive contribution to the international effort to save more lives than the total lost during hostilities. Peterborough made the bread ovens which travelled on railway rolling stock and kept desperate populations in hot bread all over the continent. The devastation of the war had left most of Europe starving, with no food stocks and absolutely nothing growing in the fields. Peterborough made the machine which dug the Channel Tunnel. We just don’t make a fuss about what we do and what we’ve done. And sometimes we fail to tell ourselves and our children. If you want to get a good job done, Peterborough has always been a good spot.\nNot only is Peterborough bigger, but it is growing faster (in terms of population) than Cambridge.\nHow exactly does Palmer – and all those other politicians – help their cause by telling us here in Peterborough that they will make every effort not to forget us, not to overlook us, not to indulge in the intra city fist fights of the past?\nPerhaps it is a good thing to be reminded that this area has (no doubt like many others) a history of testosterone fuelled and corrupt politically motivated thuggery and bullying. And not all of that was put to bed in the eighteenth – or even the nineteenth – century. Older folk still around will tell you tales of punch-ups and bags of potatoes given away in exchange for votes. Political disengagement and cycnicism has a long history here and so does political satire.\n#neverbeentoWisbech\nIncidentally, going back to that same population table, after Peterborough (first) and Cambridge (second) Wisbech is next. That means Wisbech is bigger than every other conurbation in the county of Cambridgeshire. Bigger than Huntingdon. Which even a local Conservative MP has remarkedgets all the pies. Wisbech is bigger than March. March is bigger than Ely. Have a look. We know which places get all the representation, and which places we hear nothing much about. It is obvious which neglected spots are looking a bit woebegone, even if they are historically and architecturally distinguished.\nIt is not hard to find urban areas in Cambridgeshire which have missed out on government cash.\nSteve Barclay MP may understand that this problem with infrastructure funding presents a major problem for large parts of the county, but does Mr Palmer? And then, looking at Mr Barclay’s decade of effort, it is one thing to understand that a problem exists, but resolving it requires an entirely different set of talents and sometimes you need a team. Barclay has been trying to sort the Wisbech railway line out for a decade. The story of what hasn’t happened points to core structural problems which the whole UK (not just Cambridgeshire) faces. How easy it was for Mr Beeching to cut the railway, but can the best will in the world now put a single station back? It is hard to believe this country ran an empire, when now we are either governed by people who don’t know how to do things, or they are actively being prevented. Or maybe they just don’t do teamwork?\nWhere there’s a will there’s a way, but that is not what we see in Cambridgeshire when we look at how the area’s apparently argumentative and uncooperative elected representatives behave. This probably arises out of sheer frustration. The Conservatives fight with people on their own side, there being barely any political opposition and the riven party always having been more of a club than a coherent political entity. There is also an obscure corporate culture lurking in the background of most things, which once you probe it, helps to explains what really does happen. But it is not immediately visible, even to elected representatives sitting round tables and making (or not making) decisions:\nIn the example discussed by Barclay, it fell to Chatteris to lose a local company which is valiantly trying to save Alconbury’s face by moving to the unpopular site. With lots of tax breaking help from the LEP and (it turns out) a not unrelated construction company.\nWhen I look around, baffled by the sheer quantity of miserable brown field sites (some of which make bits of Peterborough look like a concentration camp), I wonder what on earth goes on (or doesn’t) behind all those closed doors.\nWhat has happened is that in order to achieve one political objective – i.e. occupation at a promoted development site – (and one hopes for its sake a few profits), a company has been persuaded to move, but the move has created a new but exactly similar problem for the place it left behind. (It is a much less embarrassing problem in Chatteris because nobody ever goes to Chatteris.) And the construction company: I hope it has made plenty of money too. But aren’t profits “pecuniary”?\nHence my hashtag #neverbeentoWisbech in relation to another mayoral candidate altogether. But if you are not involved in the mayoral race:\nif you really have #neverbeentoWisbech you absolutely #mustsee\nAnd it seems entirely appropriate now to add #neverbeentoChatteris\nSo, is Peterborough really poorer than Cambridge?\nWell, firstly, according to Neighbourhood Statistics, (easier to read than ONS) Cambridge residents are poorer in terms of incomes than people living in the areas which surround it. But organisations in the city pay out salaries which exceed those paid by organisations based in areas around it. People from outside the city come in and take their incomes home with them. Hence Cambridge congestion.\nPeterborough suffers from exactly the same phenomenon. But perhaps more so in Peterborough than in Cambridge, residents who travel out to earn less than the city average bring back those smaller wages to spend in the city. And increasingly lose spending power as they pay more and more in non discretionary costs, such as housing. But both cities export a lot of their earned incomes.\nSo it is perfectly possible that the two cities are more similar than their spokespeople care to admit.\nI have not found a good green source of data for the two cities’ relative prosperity.\nWhat I can find depends on 100% unreliable figures. I am not interested in measures of GDP (which I know perfectly well is a very faulty measure of anything – even its designer is horrified that it is still in use). Nor do I set much store by house prices (which, just like GDP, reflect structural issues and indebtedness just as much as wealth). For these reasons I can’t rely on the Barclays Prosperity Map. I wish Palmer had provided his sources for his implied comparison.",

Happy as always to be corrected.\nIf Clerk of Works is the role which secures budgetary control (see above video), why isn’t Morson (the contractor apparently covering the role) picking up 100% of the £4.5M cost overrun? One way to establish the reason for this would be to subject the relevant contracts and subcontracts to scrutiny by a person competent in law of contract.\nPersonally, if I were the council I’d bring the role of Clerk of Works straight back in-house to establish and secure a clear line of responsibility and management.

The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe notorious collapse of Henry Penn Walk continues, visible to anybody walking over the bridge between Peterborough Town Hall on Bridge Street and the council offices at Sand Martin House. Read my previous updates for the history of this persistently unremedied collapse.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_08_09_accounting-for-rhubarb-bridge-decision/content_189.html": "I have asked people why the council hadn’t gone all out to fund a replacement bridge as soon as it realised Rhubarb Bridge was suffering an unusual degree of decay. This would have made sense, especially since there are national funding pots for sustainable travel infrastructure, and this bridge might well have qualified.\nI wrote a post about the stakeholder event, at which my question did not receive an answer.\nSince then I have I received one really useful reply. My interlocutor pointed out to me that the money for repairs and maintenance comes out of the Revenue pot at the council. Revenue is for running costs, costs which recur year after year. The money for the an surface roundabout or for a replacement bridge would come out of the Capital pot. Capital is for one off costs, for buying or building assets such as buildings and infrastructure.\nThis made me think. Pressure on the Revenue pot is extreme. And it might be this extreme funding pressure which is leading to a decision not to maintain. If it replaces an an annual maintenance bill with a one off capital bill (with arguably a smaller ongoing maintenance cost), it will be relieving pressure on the funds which are needed to look after people in extreme need.\nFunding pressures on local government affect their Revenue funding primarily. Pressure on capital funding is not as bad. Revenue funds are used to fund social care, road repairs and waste disposal. It is this funding stream which is under impossible strains as central government imposes its Austerity measures and renders all our services less and less able to cope. So all local authorities have to balance roads and waste against social care. It is quite clearly insane, but until we sack the government as we are entitled to do at each general election, there is no sign of a change in this wicked situation. And local authority roads get a small fraction of the maintenance money which Highways England gets to maintain trunk roads. Unfortunately Rhubarb Bridge does not belong to Highways England. It belongs to the council.\nThis leaves a number of items which haven’t been accounted for: lets call them uncounted elephants in the room:\n- The likely cost of accidents at an at surface crossing. It is clear that this has not been factored in. There is clearly an increased risk of impacts on emergency, hospital and care services budgets.\n- The impact of being at ground level at an air pollution hot spot on all pedestrian and cyclists using the route. The higher you are the less likely you are to be inhaling high concentrates of particulates. The closer you are the more certain it is. In pushchairs children are face to face with exhaust pipes and this is just one reason (of many) why parents pop them in what seems to be the safer environment of a car.\n- The at surface crossing will result in cyclists taking to the road, rather than wait.\n- The at surface crossing will result in people getting into a car in preference to walking with a pram or pushchair.\nAnd it leaves my original question standing: why the council hasn’t tried to get hold of (let us add “capital”) funding to rebuild the bridge – if it is beyond economic repair?",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2025_03_11_abandon-dualling-and-slow-traffic-to-improve-safety-and-flow/content_347.html": "Our local paper highlights delays.\nThe appalling project: to dual the A47 between the Wansford roundabout and the Sutton roundabout should be abandoned, especially the section near Wansford, where residents have been led to believe that duelling will prevent queueing in and out of their village during rush hours. This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\n- to accept that there is an unavoidable pinch point at this location\n- to properly repair and maintain the existing road\n- and to put in permanent graduated speed controls which has been proven to improve both flow and safety.\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess. It would be ridiculous, if it weren’t also dangerous.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_standing-order/content_237.html": "A meeting of a committee with a very long name: Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee held on Wednesday 13th June, 2012 at 7.00 pm Bourges Viersen Room, Town Hall. may turn out to be the last committee able to interrogate or discuss Peterborough City Council’s plans to build an incinerator, a so-called “Energy from Waste (EfW) plant” before an executive decision is taken by the deputy leader in consultation with the Waste 2020 Project Board (whose recommendations and minutes I believe are not published – please put a link in a comment if you find them!). If this committee does not “call-in” the decision the council is expected to proceed with incineration plans which still can’t be examined by the public.\nDocuments showing council’s current thinking and a brief history of its proposal for an EfW plant has been circulated to councillors. These documents reveal that fears which have often been expressed about the city’s recycling (how it does it and how much it does) and even bigger worries about incineration replacing recycling could well be justified.\nThe EfW plant was discussed at ITEM 5. Waste 2020 Programme- Energy from Waste Facility And Other Associated Works and Services Part of the discussion was to be “exempt”. The agenda item reads as follows, although the highlighting is mine:\n“In accordance with Standing Orders, Members are asked to determine whether the update report to be tabled at the meeting relating to agenda item 5. Waste 2020 Programme – Energy From Waste Facility which contains exempt appendices containing information relating to the financial or business affairs of a particular person (including the authority holding that information), as defined by Paragraph 3 of Schedule 12A of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1972, should be exempt and the press and public excluded from the meeting when these appendices are discussed or whether the public interest in disclosing this information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.”\nI asked from the public seating area that members be given the opportunity to vote on excluding members of the public because the chair seemed to be telling us to leave at the outset of ITEM 5 and without any vote. They were then allowed to vote. The chair also had to be persuaded by council officers that part of ITEM 5 could be discussed in public and that the exclusion could follow discussion of that part rather than apply to the whole item.\nHowever no discussion took place in this committee on the relative merits of the “public interest in disclosing” as opposed to the “public interest in maintaining the exemption” and it was not clear to me that members of the committee understood that standing orders provided them with an opportunity to debate the relative pros and cons of sharing the information with the public. The chair of the committee refused to let me raise this.\nThe public interest in disclosing is overwhelming in my view. I believe that this committee was led by its chair into a breach of its own standing orders by not having any debate about where the balance of public interest lay: whether it was better for the city to have disclosure or not. Members of the committee were simply not asked to contribute their thoughts on the subject or debate it before they were asked to vote.\nFor some members of the newly formed opposition (Independent/Labour) this was their first time sitting on this committee. I don’t know how they felt but I was in a state of mild shock by the time we were thrown out.\nPeterborough City Council’s call-in procedure\nrequires two members of a scrutiny committee to complete a form explaining the reasons for a call-in (eg failure to follow due process). The affected committee (the one within whose remit the decision takes place) then has to meet within 10 days to uphold the call-in or recommend action.\nOther councils’ procedures: Hackney Hertsmere Laudably, Thurrock Council provides for both its elected Members and the public to call-in these decisions prior to implementation.\nPeterborough has “suspended” its own call-in procedure on four occasions in 2005",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough-city-council_page_5/content_714.html": "This is the speech I delivered to residents and activists at Park Ward Hustings on 15th April in the run up to the local elections on May 3rd – this is the uncut version\nWe live in Park Ward so we live in the heart of Peterborough\nI am delighted to be standing again in Park Ward this year. I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim.

They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.",

This visit formed one of a number of visits to the region’s growing number of food banks by members of the European Green Team in the run up to the European elections on 22nd May. Our team has reported on Hunger in the East.\nThe Ramsey foodbank is based at St Thomas a Becket on Ramsey High Street and it works as part of the network of Trussell Trust foodbanks which now serve no fewer than fourteen communities throughout Cambridgeshire.\n“I arrived with me lots of grand ideas and optimism. Less than a week before my visit I had been at the opening of a new food cooperative in Peterborough which has huge ambitions to change the way we shop and eat in the city. I am talking to growers and makers and I am often around people who jar and pot things.\n“When I arrived in Ramsey the market town sitting in an area of rich arable land was particularly green and beautiful, and lush with recent rain. The harsh realities of hunger in an area which is so very rich agriculturally brought me down to earth and made me think.”\nWHY EMPTY KITCHEN CUPBOARDS IN RAMSEY?\nRev’d Gita Bond, who manages the Ramsey project explained that “The foodbank provides an emergency food supply for people without an income or on an income so low that they cannot afford food. Its clientele is identified by one of a dozen different agencies as in need of emergency food. They are issued with a voucher.”\nThe food bank relies on ongoing donations from parishioners and residents and it is also on the lookout for people who can deliver donations to people who are not mobile or who live further away.\nGita didn’t need to explain about the tea and biscuit which awaits volunteers: a group of people were talking and organising all manner of things around a busy and welcoming table. The church works with a wide range of community groups and there is a warm welcome for everybody.\nFoodbanks have proliferated because successive governments have failed and failed and failed again to tackle poverty wages.\nThe costs of living rise and people in work find their pay stands still and it is impossible to pay all the bills and put food on the table. People earning poverty pay are a growing part of those turning to food banks for help.\nPeople not in work for various reasons are more obviously vulnerable to hunger. But they are also victims of ideologically motivated and regressive government decisions.\nThe Green Party disapproves very strongly of the Department of Work and Pensions’ “sanctions” regime, which literally removes the welfare safety net from vulnerable claimants. Although a sanction can later be removed, a hunger gap opens up immediately. If the person falling into that hunger gap is lucky, they might get help from the foodbank.\n“Worries have recently been expressed to me that employees in the DWP may be being prevented by their line managers from identifying and referring people who need food immediately.”\n“We need an immediate change in government policy. Policy has gone back to before the second world war: we had malnutrition then and it is shameful that it has come back.\n“And on the ground, regardless of who gets elected on 22nd May, we need to figure out how we can improve our food resilience.\n“I was both impressed and horrified. I could see that almost all the food in the store is processed and packaged and it needs to be like that in order to have a reasonably long shelf life. Consequently there is nothing fresh at all. If someone donates something with a source of protein in it, such as a tin of fish or meatballs it can be issued. But if what is received is nutritionally unbalanced or poor, or all if all the donations are pasta, then that is all the foodbank can issue.\n“I suspect that what happens is that someone steps in: I bet it is someone with very limited means themselves, but it will be someone who cares. Communities work like this: but it is awful that they have to. But I am so very impressed with what they do manage to achieve despite the problems.\n“What I simply don’t understand is why we accept this system. Isn’t it insane for a country as wealthy as ours to function in this miserable way?\nCALL TO RETAIL CHAINS TO HELP\nThe Green Party is urging retail chains with outlets in the Ramsey area to make small regular donations of suitable items. A list is available from the foodbank.\n“But beyond these immediate calls for help, we are urging food processors to identify and minimise food waste. I sometimes hear about large amounts of perfectly edible food being dumped in Cambridgeshire: some of it destined for landfill (because it has been packaged and it is not worth unpacking it). Some of it goes for composting. In fact I heard a little while ago that on a farm close to Ramsey supermarket reject tomatoes were being composted. They might be the wrong colour or shape. This is not sustainable: this is not right.\n“It is high time we got this edible fresh food quickly to people who want and need good quality local food. I am perfectly happy to go and talk to a producer or a shop myself about what goes wrong in our broken food systems and how we can work to tackle hunger. I think the co-existence of food waste and hunger demonstrates that the food economy is not working efficiently. This is not good for consumers, but it doesn’t do any good to local farmers or food producers either.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_author_fionaradic_page_17/content_728.html": "Last night the committee with a very long name about which I have blogged previously met again, this time to consider a Call-In Request. It met to decide whether or not to call-in the decision made by Deputy Leader Councillor Matthew Lee (CONSERVATIVE) to make Viridor the preferred bidder to run the council’s planned incinerator (Lot 1).\nThe members of this committee are:\nCllr Maqbool had given advance notice of her absence and Cllr Dale McKean attended in her place.\nAt the end of about four hours of lengthy, soporific, off topic but occasionally revelatory proceedings the committee decided 4 to 3 to reject the request for a call-in.\nVoted AGAINST calling in the decision (and therefore supporting Cllr Lee’s decision)\nCouncillor Marion Todd (Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Mohammed Nadeem CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Dale McKean (Reserve) CONSERVATIVE\nVoted FOR calling in the decision (and supporting reference back to Full Council or decision maker, but unable to vote for either option since the other vote took place first)\nCouncillor Stuart Martin LABOUR\nCouncillor Nick Thulbourn LABOUR\nCouncillor Judy Fox INDEPENDENT\nThe meeting began at 6pm with Apologies and Declaration of Interests. No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough-city-council_page_4/content_708.html": "Since my first update on the collapse, the press got excited and phone calls were made. And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nThe Cambridge News published some of what I said along with a photo .\nPeterborough Telegraph believes the financial burden will fall upon the tenants of the block. I believe that this would be profoundly wrong and I will set out why in this second update.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nthat the approved planning application according to which the block was to be constructed is 96/00001/FUL | Validated: Mon 07 Oct 1996 | Status: Decided\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nBehind the sheeting is sand. Here is similar material taken from a picture about a road being built on the construction company’s Facebook page. This may or may not be what is behind the steel sheeting too.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.",

It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_power-generation/content_164.html": "I am convinced that the design of wind turbines is still in its infancy. Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened.

If this committee does not “call-in” the decision the council is expected to proceed with incineration plans which still can’t be examined by the public.\nDocuments showing council’s current thinking and a brief history of its proposal for an EfW plant has been circulated to councillors. These documents reveal that fears which have often been expressed about the city’s recycling (how it does it and how much it does) and even bigger worries about incineration replacing recycling could well be justified.\nThe EfW plant was discussed at ITEM 5. Waste 2020 Programme- Energy from Waste Facility And Other Associated Works and Services Part of the discussion was to be “exempt”. The agenda item reads as follows, although the highlighting is mine:\n“In accordance with Standing Orders, Members are asked to determine whether the update report to be tabled at the meeting relating to agenda item 5. Waste 2020 Programme – Energy From Waste Facility which contains exempt appendices containing information relating to the financial or business affairs of a particular person (including the authority holding that information), as defined by Paragraph 3 of Schedule 12A of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1972, should be exempt and the press and public excluded from the meeting when these appendices are discussed or whether the public interest in disclosing this information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.”\nI asked from the public seating area that members be given the opportunity to vote on excluding members of the public because the chair seemed to be telling us to leave at the outset of ITEM 5 and without any vote. They were then allowed to vote. The chair also had to be persuaded by council officers that part of ITEM 5 could be discussed in public and that the exclusion could follow discussion of that part rather than apply to the whole item.\nHowever no discussion took place in this committee on the relative merits of the “public interest in disclosing” as opposed to the “public interest in maintaining the exemption” and it was not clear to me that members of the committee understood that standing orders provided them with an opportunity to debate the relative pros and cons of sharing the information with the public. The chair of the committee refused to let me raise this.\nThe public interest in disclosing is overwhelming in my view. I believe that this committee was led by its chair into a breach of its own standing orders by not having any debate about where the balance of public interest lay: whether it was better for the city to have disclosure or not. Members of the committee were simply not asked to contribute their thoughts on the subject or debate it before they were asked to vote.\nFor some members of the newly formed opposition (Independent/Labour) this was their first time sitting on this committee. I don’t know how they felt but I was in a state of mild shock by the time we were thrown out.\nPeterborough City Council’s call-in procedure\nrequires two members of a scrutiny committee to complete a form explaining the reasons for a call-in (eg failure to follow due process).

The workshop explained how an “asset of community value” can be registered with the local council and what that means should it be or become threatened. The rules were explained and what and what was not eligible.\nThe new group is not a “political” group in that peoples’ views on the legislation may be strong, but those views are not the point. I would describe this as a “technical” alliance between people prepared to share knowledge and help people in Peterborough who want to do this. I was quite shocked to learn that Peterborough has only registered two Assets of Community Value (the Green Backyard and the Football Ground) whereas Chelmsford identified seventy which needed to be registered.\nWhat about the Lido? We need a little list.\nCllr Andy Coles acted as spokesperson for the Peterborough group at the workshop and he was an obvious elected councillor lead. For those who don’t know him he is a keen supporter of The Green Backyard and used to be its beekeeper. He has also supported the parishing of Westwood (a project currently in abeyance, but which I strongly support) and he currently holds the council’s “community” brief.\nAlun Williams volunteered to look after the membership.\nYou can join the new group on face book. You will then be added to a google group.\nHi Fiona,\nActually, joining the facebook group won’t get you added to the mailing list, as this doesn’t give me access to people’s email addresses. If the mailing list gets used I’ll try to share content with the group and encourage people to sign up.\nLikeLike",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2014_01_30_what-not-voting-sounds-like-in-peterborough/content_90.html": "Last night I arrived at Council too late to catch the whole debate on the council’s plan to make a £1.2M annual saving by cutting the services it currently provides to Peterborough’s children.\nBut I was in time for the recorded vote. Our local newspaper has already published this story but has not (so far) provided a list of who voted which way. I suppose this information will eventually be published in the council’s very own minutes, but who ever reads those?\nSo, since several people have asked for a breakdown, here are my gleanings from the Spectators Gallery:\nCON Arculus, Nick ABSTAIN West\nCON Casey, Graham ABSTAIN Orton Longueville\nCON Lee, Matthew ABSTAIN Fletton\nCON Maqbool, Yasmeen ABSTAIN West\nCON Simons, George ABSTAIN Paston\nCON Sanders, David name heard but unable to hear response Eye & Thorney\nCON Allen, Sue name not heard Orton Waterville\nCON Cereste Marco name not heard Stanground Central\nCON McKean, Dale name not heard Eye & Thorney\nCON Walsh, Irene name not heard Stanground Central\nCON Dalton, Matthew NOT VOTING West\nCON Day, Sue NOT VOTING Paston\nCON Elsey, Gavin NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Fitzgerald, Wayne NOT VOTING Bretton North\nCON Goodwin, Janet NOT VOTING Orton Longueville\nCON Harper, Chris NOT VOTING Stanground East\nCON Hiller, Peter NOT VOTING Northborough\nCON Holdich, John (OBE) NOT VOTING Ghinton & Wittering\nCON Kreling, Pam NOT VOTING Park\nCON Lamb, Diane NOT VOTING Glinton & Wittering\nCON Nadeem, Mohammed NOT VOTING Central\nCON Nawaz, Gul NOT VOTING Ravensthorpe\nCON North, Nigel NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Peach, John NOT VOTING Park\nCON Rush, Brian NOT VOTING Stanground Central\nCON Scott, Sheila NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Seaton, David NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Serluca, Lucia NOT VOTING Fletton\nCON Stokes, June NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Thacker, Paula NOT VOTING Werrington South\nCON Todd, Marion NOT VOTING East\nCON Over, David NOT VOTING Barnack\nLAB Forbes, Lisa FOR Orton Longueville\nLAB Jamil, Mohammed FOR Central\nLAB Johnson, Jo FOR East\nLAB Khan, Nazim (MBE) FOR Central\nLAB Knowles, John FOR Paston\nLAB Martin, Stuart FOR Bretton North\nLAB Shabbir, Nabil FOR East\nLAB Shearman, John FOR Park\nLAB Thulbourn, Nick FOR Fletton & Woodston\nLAB Murphy, Ed FOR Ravensthorpe\nLAB Sylvester, Ann FOR Bretton North\nLD Fower, Darren FOR Werrington South\nLD Sandford, Nick FOR Walton\nLD Shaheed, Asif FOR Walton\nLD Davidson, Julia name heard but unable to hear response Werrington South\nPIF Miners, Adrian declared interest, so unable to vote Dogsthorpe\nPIF Ash, Christopher FOR Dogsthorpe PIF Fletcher, Michael FOR Bretton South\nPIF Fox, John FOR Werrington North\nPIF Fox, Judith FOR Werrington North\nPIF Harrington, David FOR Newborough\nPIF Saltmarsh, Christabel FOR Dogsthorpe\nPIF Sharp, Keith FOR North\nPIF Swift, Charles (OBE) FOR “but confused” North\nPIF Lane, Stephen name not heard Werrington North\nI found it very difficult indeed to pick up the voices of the Conservative councillors last night. It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.\nThis is what it looked like to another observer: http://parkfarmneighbourhoodwatch.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/childrens-centres-first-for.html\nHere is a photo of the opposition standing up to demand a recorded vote: http://terry-harris.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Full-Council-Childrens-Centre-Closures/G0000xzhmtuMp.a4/I0000UNVajRUjfiU\nBut the big question now is will Cabinet pay any attention at all to the wishes of Council when it meets on Monday at 10am?\nThanks Fiona, good work. We believe that the New Ark grant is protected, but with the present lot in the cabinet nothing is safe.\nLikeLike\nHi Fiona,\nPlease see attached a poster for our next salsa party\nWe are once again offering FREE ENTRY for new starters J\nSo please send it out with your next newsletter,\nBest wishes,\nAlan x\nLikeLike\nThank you: one party affiliation amended.\nLikeLike\nPlease correct the above entry. I became ashamed to belong to this so-called conservative group. I left and joined the Independents so that I am free to vote according to my own principles and not to be dictated to as was witnessed yesterday evening.\nLikeLike\nMichael Fletcher is now an Independent Councillor (PIF) and no longer a Conservative I’m sure Fiona.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_budget/content_31.html": "This meeting was live-streamed here. It began at 6pm.\nAbsence\nThe absence of ten councillors for the budget meeting is concerning. It is a high percentage. My very best wishes to Mayor Marco Cereste who has had a major health shock, and to his family. One councillor was legally prohibited from attending, pending a court appearance, but was able to ask a question from a remote location. I am very happy to live in a country where laws are respected and those who understand how best to implement them are able to do so. Hats off to officers for working to demonstrate a never before observed (by me, at any rate) example of inclusion.\nAbstainers\nElected representatives who ABSTAIN on a budget might be expressing frustration or unhappiness, which, however genuinely felt, are emotions of no practical use to the residents they were elected to serve. Where the budget is concerned, it is irresponsible, because a good budget requires effective team work.\nOpposers\nThere is a point in voting AGAINST a budget. But to vote usefully AGAINST a budget, you must have done your homework and have another “alternative” budget up your sleeve. And you must also have the support of other elected representatives, so that you can be confident that it stands a chance of being supported if presented. In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work. You could then vote AGAINST the budget presented by the administration of the government (in this case a council) with a clean conscience, because you have built a better option. When the administration’s proposed budget falls to pass, you can then present your alternative budget. This might be just what the people who elected you need you to do.\nYou can see the breakdown of votes and who said what here.\nHistory of partisan non cooperation\nPeterborough’s unitary government in recent years has too often featured two sides sneering at each other’s ideas and policies and individuals not listening to good alternative policies simply because they originate from outside their own hard baked ideology (a classic example was the destruction of the local 20’s Plenty campaign, achieved by kicking a worthwhile project into the long grass of a “pilot project” and then those who kicked it never brought the results of that project back to council). Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets. The independent panel seems to have helped sort this out.\nPlaying to the online gallery\nHowever there is still some bad behaviour. During council meetings, councillors are frequently talking to their electorate in the council chamber and putting themselves onto social media. Councillor Nicola Day even took a team selfie during the meeting. Some appear to struggle to put their phone down and are constantly watching their phones while on a livestream. They embarrass Peterborough and its residents. It should be possible for councillors to switch their phones off during a meeting: it is professional to do so and it is simply good manners to give your full attention to the agenda and to your colleagues in a meeting.\nOnly just\nThe passage of the council’s budget on Wednesday was too tight for comfort, but compared with recent years, it was a welcome moment of calm organisation. I congratulate all those who worked constructively with Councillor Mohammed Jamil, Cabinet Member for Finance & Corporate Governance, whose approach has been consultative and consensual, to contribute to it and to vote for it. Hats off especially to Councillor Dennis Jones and to Councillor Wayne Fitzgerald. Without their closing speeches, their clarity and eloquence, this might not have passed and I strongly suspect that there was no superior alternative budget waiting in the wings. Passing any kind of workable budget in this era of badly managed economic decline (Westminster has never ended the “Austerity”) is nothing short of miraculous. I had high hopes for a new Labour government, but so far it has disappointed.\nWe have yet to see what happens as the independent supervisory panel finally walks away.",

It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2018_04_29_vote-green-in-2018-speech/content_74.html": "This is the speech I delivered to residents and activists at Park Ward Hustings on 15th April in the run up to the local elections on May 3rd – this is the uncut version\nWe live in Park Ward so we live in the heart of Peterborough\nI am delighted to be standing again in Park Ward this year. I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.\nSadly I don’t have the auditors reports anymore – but way back, around 2008, PCC was warned their financial policy of freezing council tax was putting their finances in jeopardy, but they carried on for several more years. Selling off assets, relying on Government grants the auditors told them would change. Doing deals with the football club and closing or “modernising” services. A word heavy with deceit in some circumstances.\nLikeLike",

Many people will not be focussing on getting out and about, struggling instead to keep warm with the help of government funded warm hubs. I knew about the council’s hubs, but doubted that people knew how to find them. Last time I’d looked there were about five. Today I found nineteen. The number and complexity of strikes is also exploding as perfectly understandable and justifiable discontent escalates. I’d prefer if this public calendar didn’t stay true for very long, but it is true today. If wage disputes were settled and people received the incomes at levels they need, this Strikes & Warm Hubs Calendar could very quickly be made redundant. But unfortunately only the ruling Tories who make up this awful Westminster government can do that.",

Those with any hearing difficulties at all struggled, even when listening to those around the same table. The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available.

Leader of the Peterborough City Council, Wayne Fitzgerald, (featured in still my most popular post) has responded to Camcycle’s 2023 local election survey about active travel.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nActive Travel is a government department\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.",

To date he has not honoured me with a response.\nMonday 22 April 2024\nDear Paul Bristow,\nPension restitution for women born in the 1950s\nAlthough with the exception of The Right Honourable Sir Julian Lewis MP, Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, I note that you yourself and your fellow Conservative MPs have agreed – or been whipped – not to support EDM 243 https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/61723\nPlease can you explain why you are not supporting full pension restitution for a group of women, many of whose first parliamentary votes are likely to have been for Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to be elected Prime Minister and during whose first term, The United Kingdom signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1981 (later ratified in 1986).\nPERSONAL DETAILS PARA REMOVED\nI believe 50’s born women are owed full restitution.\nPERSONAL DETAILS SECTION REMOVED But it is my opinion that the UK workforce is less motivated and has less to look forward to by entering paid employment now than at any time in my life. You might like to have a word about what motivates people with the one person who has signed the EDM. With what was a presumably successful career in His Majesty’s armed forces, maybe he could give you a view on how a monstrous injustice followed by a huge breach of trust would impact morale in the services. I would be astonished if he and I could not agree on that.\nWill you reconsider your own and your party’s position, please?\nIt was close. After the Conservatives insisted on two recounts and then insisted on yet another check, the Park Ward result was finally agreed some time after three o’clock this morning. I got to bed at 4am. The full results for the Peterborough City Council elections are here. Votes for the first First Past The Post Police and Crime Commissioner election are still being counted.\nI am extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me and who supported me in this election. Everything you did means a lot. Thank you so very much.\nFor me, the campaign I was most concerned about was the one run by Kirsty Knight to retain her seat and I congratulate her very very warmly on achieving this despite having made a tough and gutsy decision to leave the Green Party just a few weeks prior to the election. Kirsty has almost certainly broken another election campaign record and she has certainly set an excellent precedent for Peterborough. Thank you everyone who has supported Kirsty.\nIt was noticeable to me that a couple of newbie Liberal Democrat candidates also won with remarkably short campaigns. Hats off to both of them too.\nI feel for Nick Sandford who has to continue to perform his duties as Mayor (until the Mayor making ceremony) despite losing his seat last night. I know he’ll see the funny side, but still. While Peterborough elects in thirds, surely, most years, the Mayor doesn’t have to be someone facing election in the same year? It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?\nA succession of disappointing Conservative governments have left the UK with an extraordinary number of groups with very substantial grievances. One group consists of about 3,800,000 women who were born in the 50s.\nI was. Were you?\nIf not, you’ll know a few. Please support the campaign for full restitution to UK women born in the 1950’s. Please share this post and please join me. I have taken these two simple actions:\nJoin me and write to your MP Explain to your MP what this increase in pension age has meant to you. Check first whether or not your MP has already signed in support of EDM 243 The motion is “That this House welcomes the positive interventions from so many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have suffered pensions loss through the targeting of their pension rights; pays tribute to constituents and campaigners in their ongoing fight for justice; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory laws; and encourages the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to join mediation, noting there are no impediments to doing so.” If your MP hasn’t, please, when you write, ask your MP to sign EDM 24.\nNothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nAs if Voter ID wasn’t enough, this year brings a new voting complication\nVoters delivering their votes by hand to the Town Hall may be surprised this year by the notices stapled to the doors warning them NOT to post their ballots in the Town Hall letter box without a “return form”. This is a new rule! A new form! Nothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nThe government has added yet another risk to voting postally. There are others, including postal delivery delays (extremely big risk at the moment), rejection of ballot due to signature or date not being matched (very small risk in my opinion, but still a risk), mislaying the pack from the council, theft of the pack or the ballot paper from someone who is vulnerable, someone who is being bullied, or someone who doesn’t understand or care (very big risk indeed).\nIncidentally, it is forbidden for candidates to handle anyone else’s postal packs or ballots. They should only ever handle their own. If a candidate or anyone you don’t trust completely offers to take your vote for you, please report it. You might be experiencing a crime and the council will check it out for you.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: it doesn’t look any better than it smells.\nThames Water’s creditors face a massive haircut if this Conservative government decides, despite its Conservative privatisation ideology, that it turns out to be the best organisation to put right the very stinky mess which Conservative deregulated private business ideologies seem to have combined to let of a utility company make.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing. But now the financing which underpins the entire UK utility sector has caught a chill. And that contagion could hit the UK economy as a whole. Let’s face it: this doesn’t look any better than it smells, unless you happen to be a bond trader with money to flush.\nMeanwhile, global temperatures carry on breaking records. March was the eleventh consecutive month in which global sea and air temperatures broke records.\nWhy does voting independent in Park Ward makes sense this year? Because what I said in my address to voters last year remains true this year: Park Ward has exactly the same problems. But this year we have even more challenges and we need to start by describing them honestly.\nLast year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nBig Bins – outside flats and shops\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nHealth & Education services struggle with residents who move\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nResources for Roads\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.\nThis year I am standing as an independent candidate in Peterborough\nPolice and Crime Commissioner, Peterborough City Council and several parish council elections will be held on Thursday 2nd May. But this time, I am standing in Park Ward as an independent politician. This means that I can set my own campaign priorities and ignore group think and party lines. If elected, I would be free to vote only for those policies and decisions which would improve the lives of my constituents and which I personally agreed with.\nI supported Councillor Kirsty Knight’s successful Green Party campaigns last year. This year she is fighting to retain her seat for the first time as an independent councillor. This takes great courage and I respect her hugely for her decision. I endorse, am supporting, and will continue to support Kirsty after what I very much hope will be another victory and another campaign first. Please vote for and support Kirsty, who in her first term has already established herself as an outstanding city councillor.\nCollette Francis (who campaigned energetically for the Bretton Oak Tree and joined the Greens) is also standing in West as an independent candidate. As a serving parish councillor interested and competent in paperwork and planning, I am confident Collette will make a superb city councillor. Please vote for and support Collette.\nLastly, thank you to all those who have helped and tried to help during the past few months. I have heard every word and I appreciate all you have done and said. Thank you.\nPlease get in touch to support my campaigns, or those of Collette or Kirsty\nWho is observing, and who is maybe not even noticing the visible and costly effects of climate change in Peterborough? A clue might have landed on your doormat.\nI walked through Central Park recently and realised that nearly every single box had died. I took a couple of photos intending to write to the council and promptly forgot.\nThen, thanks to Angus Ellis I received a useful reminder. Thank you, Angus.\nThe reminder arrived in the form of a Labour and Co-operative Party leaflet suggesting I vote for Angus who is this party’s candidate in Park Ward. It dropped on my doormat and I eventually got round to reading it. I discovered a very rare picture of Park Ward Councillor Mohammed Samir (who, along with another Ravensthorpe councillor is not profligate with his words or his image) at the bottom right of page three. And even more surprising, there, in front of his frown and rising up the bank behind him is scorched, brown and dead or dying box hedging, telling every sharp eyed reader in Park Ward the very sad story about its own highly likely extinction.\nWeather conditions are increasingly brutal and this pattern of intemperate weather (part of our new, not so temperate climate) is particularly cruel to box, a key evergreen parks and gardens hedging plant. Long periods of extreme drought alternating with non stop record rainfall will have stressed this along with many other plants, including many of Central Park’s trees.\nSlowly, since 2007 when it was first recorded in the UK, the box moth has been travelling north (it began its very long journey somewhere in South East Asia!) and here it is: rampaging across Peterborough. It noticed it in my garden only last summer. It probably reached the park before that.\nI wrote to the council this morning to ask that the dead box bushes are dug out. A very sad job for those who tended them. It used to be good gardening practice to burn diseased and infested plants. These days, hot composting (we have brown garden bins for that in Peterborough) will probably do the job of disinfection.\nI have also been thinking about what needs doing in Central Park to deal with the loss of the lovely robust evergreen structure which the box has provided for many years around Central Park’s beds and along paths. Evergreens are particularly important in winter, when so many plants are bare.\nReplacement structural evergreen hedging can’t be planted safely in Spring or Summer (October is the very earliest sensible time) and until then at the earliest, removing dead plants will open the beds up to unwanted foot traffic: both pet and human.\nFast growing decorative annual flowers might have time to provide protective ground cover until a decision is made on whether and how to replace.\nI would be very surprised if there is one plant which could do what the extraordinary and now at risk box did for all the park’s flower beds, since the conditions in each bed are increasingly varied: some are very very dry (memorial gardens) and others around the outer path are shady and one or two occasionally waterlogged. Decisions could be complicated.\nSeeding with forget-me-not (on damper beds) and/or nasturtium (round the top of the dry memorial garden).\nAnd if a decision is made to retain hedge type edging, which plants might work well in the various conditions to be found in different beds around the park?\nI think that rosemary might work around the memorial garden. It doesn’t mind neglect and drought and responds to drought by flowering (all year round!!) if dry. It doesn’t mind being on a bank which will lose rainwater. It can be clipped (min twice a year) into a very beautiful and sturdy box type hedge. But it probably shouldn’t go in straight away: there will be too much box moth around and it’s definitely a second choice target!",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_08_06_rhubarb-bridge-stakeholder-event/content_418.html": "An event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).\nOne thought on “Rhubarb Bridge Stakeholder Event”",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++",

This photo was taken from the Spectators Gallery which is currently closed. Elected councillors are (I think) sitting at the long tables with some very strange headwear at rest on them. None of them is female, although there are a few women sitting behind them, one with a dark cloche hat and most of the others sporting dark berets. Headwear is not flashy. The gallery (behind the photographer) is probably full to bursting. Guests and public are seated around the councillors very tightly, leaving “the floor” clear. Slender tables are unencumbered with lights and mics. The room is shown at its best: lit by daylight. The Mayor’s parlour is packed with what could be a choir in uniform (door to the right) and so is the balcony of the foyer (door to the left). The principal uniform is the man’s suit, worn with greater or less formality. One or two of the men may be wearing gowns and one on the left side may be wearing a chain of office. High table is court like. The chair’s chair is a proper throne and whoever sat on it would have a commanding view of the entire room, including the whole of the Spectators Gallery. (The current layout – I’m not sure when or why the room was turned around – is not at all as clever from the point of view of the chair.) Still familiar today: the person in clerical garb. The architecture is happily and joyfully calling on medieval precedent within a confident classically formatted & commercially alive building (rented shops were built below this room, the income to the council intended to keep rates as low as possible).

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2017_01_04_philippa-and-the-judge/content_63.html": "Today’s story about the jailing of Philippa by Judge Noble in Peterborough highlights several critical problems in Peterborough.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\nRanked with all the other parliamentary constituencies in the UK, the City of Peteborough is ranked fifth from the bottom. Bad driving is at epidemic levels in the city and around it. And given its appalling safety record, one has to ask why Judge Noble feels any need to conciliate the community of motorists living anywhere round here.\nThis is not Philippa’s fault either.\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\n4 Jan 2017\nA thought provoking article raising many excellent points\nLikeLike\nVery thoughtfully written Fiona, it’s so sad to see the judiciary not recognising mental health issues and the support that is needed. You should send this as an open letter to the judge. I wonder is anyone appealing on Phillippa’s behalf, surely this could be overturned – it just doesn’t make sense!\nLikeLike\nHaving spent time with Mel Shaw I can guarantee that Philippa will receive no professional care at HMP Peterborough. They cannot even get adequate GP cover. She must be released to proper facilities\nLikeLike",

Democratic deficiencies open up cracks and we have crises of trust.

She helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which Julie Howell kept her deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proving strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. Julie Howell was subsequently elected to the city council in 2018 as Peterborough’s first Green city councillor.\nFiona campaigned to remain in the EU during the referendum and previously stood for election in East Region to the European Parliament in 2014.\n“My family is international in its connections and outlook.

I stand firmly with those whose rights and relationships – personal and business – are being overlooked by the state. People are not bargaining chips. It isn’t acceptable for politicians to play to the gallery by discarding peoples’ hard won rights. It is one thing for the state to assert its right to govern itself (even if that right was never endangered). It is entirely another to put our current economic system at risk, and to threaten family life. And not just family life. Businesses are also being rocked by incompetent and self interested styles of government. If we are to leave the EU, let us be sure to make that a sensible and constructive process and make full use of Green Party thinking on local decision making and empowerment. But I am now absolutely sure that the decision about leaving the EU was founded on shoddy information and that those in power will have to give voters a sensible and fully informed choice. Of course voters will be cross: they are entitled to be furious.

This is a rare thing in Peterborough: a ward hustings. As far as I am aware Park Ward is the only ward in the unitary authority of Peterborough which holds a regular hustings events. Here, voters are invited, either by the residents’ associations or by whoever leaflets the ward. Park Ward has begun to view them as an important part of the run up to election day. I am a big fan of hustings, as a glimpse at my blog will confirm. I’d like to see several in every ward, since they give people chances to thrash out where candidates stand on different issues, and how they perform, and what they are like.\nAnyway every candidate appearing on the ballot paper in May had been invited to the Church Hall by a local residents’ association and the turnout was small, but respectable and well informed. John Peach, CON, was the last candidate to arrive. I would probably have been taking my seat and organising bits of paper when there was the very slightest flutter of excitement in the audience. The hustings proceeded without incident.\nOne of the most true and telling observations of the 2015 election campaign was made by a man at the back of the audience. He pointed out that climate change had disappeared from all the parties’ election campaigns.\nAfter the event someone else came up to me and asked me to accompany him into the car park to see how John Peach had parked his car. He claimed to have felt an impact, but I am pretty sure his tongue was in his cheek and I have to say the wall did not move for me. But naturally I had a look. And of course I took a photo.\nI couldn’t see the wall behind the rear bumper at all. Can you?\nI realised that had there been the sort of penetrative event you see in a crazy American road movie, instead of talking to a man in a car park, I might have seen a man flying across my field of vision and just for a second I imagined him fly, hanging on to his church hall chair as a massive black car skidded across the parquet floor in a hail of bricks and plaster dust. But that was just me imagining something which certainly did not happen that evening. Thank goodness.\nWhat I did observe is that Cllr John Peach, (who was reelected and has since been crowned Mayor of our fair city) had proved himself capable of parking his car next to a wall in such a way that there is not a single millimetre between the car and the bricks. Not a single one.\nI blog this now only because the antique Jaguar, the mayoral vehicle EG1 is reportedly:\nand I for one would like to know how #PossibleRightOff happened.\nAnd what it costs to keep this particular mayor in maintenance and insurance.\nPerhaps Conservative councillors could tell the voters exactly what they each spend on driving around the city in very fancy cars, and how much of that expense is funded by residents?\nPeterborough Green Festival 2015\nHappy St George’s Day!\ntwinkle twinkle polished car\nYou see, our Park Ward councillor team (two Labour, one Conservative) went for what they describe as “aggressive pavement cyclists” recently and tasked the police with talking to shocked children and middle aged women cycling along gently as well as people who couldn’t speak English. (My sample was tiny: but I did one.) They fined about a third of the people they stopped: most of them probably incapable of being polite and apologising nicely to a policeman. (Some offenders just got warned, although whether or not cycling on a pavement is an offence in all circumstances is a moot point.) So I think it only fair to point out that cycling on the pavement can be a perfectly logical and reasonable response to dangerous junctions, roads and cycle lanes and is a better place to cycle if your lights have just packed up.\nCars which park in the Park Road cycle lane, or across it or on the pavement are a regular feature of life at this end of Park Road and I for one don’t think it is safe. I think badly behaved drivers are one of a number of contributory factors encouraging “pavement cycling”.\nI didn’t paint in the double yellow lines (which most people don’t even believe are there any more: they are virtually worn out). The Conservative council did. So I think elected Conservative members of all people should be able to show us how we can all live happily with their decisions.",

And tomorrow (assuming it is signed tomorrow)?\nHave you checked whether or not the council considered options other than incineration? What evidence of careful consideration of other options are you relying on? Are you aware that the council has been consistently challenged on this since 2007, (and possibly earlier)?\nAre you aware that the business cases for incineration in general and for this particular incinerator are both now being challenged as unsafe (the economy and the market having changed substantially)? Have you considered the financial impact on council tax payers should these cautions turn out to be well founded? And that if the business performs as badly as expected are you aware of the likely impact on recycling, too?\nHas the contract been set up in such a way that it can attract structural or grant funding? Or has it been set up in such a way that it is ineligible?\nAre you aware of the total cost of this contract? Figures of £76M and £80M have been quoted recently in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph for the capital costs alone. Is that figure current? What are the overall 30 year costs for this project? Is it acceptable that this information is still not in the public domain? Is it acceptable that innocent readers of their local paper might assume that this figure is the total cost of the project?\nAre you aware that the council is deliberately choosing out of date technology and describing it as “tried and tested”? (the information on technology is still not in the public domain).\nAre you aware that the council might be comparing the energy recovery of its own plant with Scandinavian examples? If so are you aware that in Scandinavia (which is used to colder weather and historically much more aware of the importance of insulation and energy security) high performance hot water supply grids are planned in (eg for swimming pools or district heating). Peterborough has not planned a supply grid and has not explained who will buy energy and power generated by this incinerator. Have you seen an example of the output and recovery figures from either Peterborough’s as planned and have you compared that with an operational equivalent in Scandinavia and an operational equivalent in the UK (local campaigners are finding that those in the UK can’t sell their power).\nAre you aware that the UK’s statutory regulatory regime for air pollution (in which the council has placed its trust) is widely regarded as unfit for purpose? The Health Protection Agency is about to undertake research into whether or not it can substantiate the assurances and claims it has been making and upon which the Environment Agency and numerous councils have historically relied. Is the council aware of the potential damage it could do to its own Environment Capital “aspiration” if, as widely expected, it can’t?\nDo you know enough about air pollution and monitoring in the city? Does Peterborough monitor anything other than road traffic? Where are the monitoring stations and are they in the right places? What regime is planned for when the incinerator is operational?\nHave you considered the social, health and cost impacts on the city of a mass burn incinerator in an area with very high (and rising) levels of social deprivation?\nAre you aware that a new incinerator on an industrial site in Fletton is operating and is apparently making people ill, but that the council has not done anything about it, and that not one person amongst the “officers’ panel” and members present at the Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee Call in Meeting on 29th August was equipped to advise the ward councillor who asked about this problem in his ward? I understand that the ward councillor had been told by the Environment Agency that it was a matter for the council. As a member of the public I witnessed that not a single person actually knew how to deal with this relatively small problem – nobody offered to look into it or explain who the ward councillor should talk to, if it wasn’t the Environment Agency. This is despite the presence of senior council officers and (at least) three lawyers.\nAre you satisfied with the monitoring and regulation of pollution in the city?\nPlease can Richard Olive have answers to the questions which Peterborough Friends of the Earth has asked the council on this matter?\nCan you write NONE against – or otherwise provide detail of any personal, family or party interest you have had, have or are likely to have – in any of the following:\n- the council’s Energy Services Company?\n- “Blue Sky”?\n- this sector?\n- this decision?\nI look forward to hearing from you, etc.\nExcellent work, fiona!

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_railway/content_168.html": "An enormous crack opened up on Henry Penn Walk and was reported (with extraordinary drone photos taken from above it) on 4th March 2021 in Peterborough Matters when a council spokesperson is reported to have said, “The current state of the walkway is a result of the structure, sheet piling, beneath the path falling.” On 2nd August 2021 the Peterborough Telegraph reported that the council and a corporate landowner were still at odds over who is responsible for the maintenance of this structure. This is an extraordinary standoff, given that a river is a highly dynamic entity, with carving into land and carrying it away away its favourite and constant sport. The embankment constitutes its urban restraint. Wouldn’t it make sense to fix the damage first and then sort out who owed how much in the courts? A few days ago I went to see whether or not the crack had been repaired I found a larger crack than I expected. Close up, the embankment undulates as if there’d been an earthquake or a landslip. A sort of fountain of subsoil sits at could conceivably be the source of the damage (if it got there by being thrust up right out of the ground). It is as if if water got stuck somewhere and had to burst up through what is a remarkably deep layer of tarmac. And guess what is growing just where that pile of subsoil is? Yes. Tomatoes. Of course, they could have been planted in an apartment garden. But wild tomatoes are common in the UK and they are celebrated self seeders. They can be spotted growing happily along railway tracks and wherever human manure distributes their tiny tell tale seeds. So my question is, given Anglian Water’s discovery of a major sewer works scandal not so very far away, at the junction of Wentworth Street and Bourges Boulevard this July (also reported to the council and in our local paper), has Anglian Water investigated whether or not something equally stinky might lurk beneath Peterborough embankment’s spectacular crack? Could damage to, neglect of, a blockage in or a fault in the drains cause damage on this scale? Or, conversely, could the crack have damaged a foul drain, enabling a tell tale seed or two to escape? After all, what force is there, other than water, capable of taking the huge corrugated steel retaining wall holding the embankment in place and bending it out of true? I’m no expert, but I can see that the embankment wall is not vertical any more. My theories about water transporting sewage carrying tomato seeds and pushing steel walls around might both be fanciful. But if anyone has a more sensible explanation, do tell.\nIs that a clue in that crack?\nTomatoes grow on Peterborough’s embankment",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_sustainable-transport/content_399.html": "An event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2024_05_03_thank-you-for-voting-for-me-yesterday/content_28.html": "It was close. After the Conservatives insisted on two recounts and then insisted on yet another check, the Park Ward result was finally agreed some time after three o’clock this morning. I got to bed at 4am. The full results for the Peterborough City Council elections are here. Votes for the first First Past The Post Police and Crime Commissioner election are still being counted.\nI am extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me and who supported me in this election. Everything you did means a lot. Thank you so very much.\nFor me, the campaign I was most concerned about was the one run by Kirsty Knight to retain her seat and I congratulate her very very warmly on achieving this despite having made a tough and gutsy decision to leave the Green Party just a few weeks prior to the election. Kirsty has almost certainly broken another election campaign record and she has certainly set an excellent precedent for Peterborough. Thank you everyone who has supported Kirsty.\nIt was noticeable to me that a couple of newbie Liberal Democrat candidates also won with remarkably short campaigns. Hats off to both of them too.\nI feel for Nick Sandford who has to continue to perform his duties as Mayor (until the Mayor making ceremony) despite losing his seat last night. I know he’ll see the funny side, but still. While Peterborough elects in thirds, surely, most years, the Mayor doesn’t have to be someone facing election in the same year? It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_fracking/content_179.html": "Thank you for contacting me about fracking, I understand your concerns with this matter and appreciate your correspondence.\nShale gas is a promising new potential energy resource which could reduce our reliance on imported gas and help with keeping energy costs low. It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2024_07_06_excellent-description-of-the-problem/content_445.html": "At 08:15 (once the programme ends) Just elected Paul Waugh MP (of all people!) describes, (as only a highly articulate, politically savvy and most importantly an experienced journalist could) what was going on there. I recognised his description as applicable to events in Peterborough. If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_democracy/content_128.html": "This is a list of publicly owned (that means we the public own them) venues which are made available by statute free of charge by the city council for people to hold hustings in. Venues for Hustings – for Candidates 2015\nPeterborough’s best hustings are often held in churches or schools. These can be public or closed events. Hustings they can be held anywhere and by any organisation. A school event is particularly interesting: because children often see politics as something which only happens on the television or on the radio. You are never too young to vote. You are never too young to debate a issue.\nThe person hosting the hustings will probably need a candidate to apply for one of these venues. The legislation (statute) governing this provision is the Representation of the People Act.\nThis hustings will happen later this week and there are rules (below the picture) about how to ask a question. The organisation of the hustings is up to the host.\nI have never attended a hustings which got out of hand (close, but the well behaved sixth formers and their teachers worked hard to persuade candidates perhaps not to resort to fisticuffs). A calm, friendly and firm person in the chair will help ensure a hustings keeps its hair on. However the history of violence and intimidation within and working against the British democratic process is substantial and centuries old. This is well understood by parliament itself. So to help keep things peaceful and calm, legislation makes a police presence available to hustings organisers if they feel they need one. A very important, but perhaps not well understood statutory duty of the police is to uphold the democratic process, of which the hustings form a very important important part.\nLast night I arrived at Council too late to catch the whole debate on the council’s plan to make a £1.2M annual saving by cutting the services it currently provides to Peterborough’s children.\nBut I was in time for the recorded vote. Our local newspaper has already published this story but has not (so far) provided a list of who voted which way. I suppose this information will eventually be published in the council’s very own minutes, but who ever reads those?\nSo, since several people have asked for a breakdown, here are my gleanings from the Spectators Gallery:\nCON Arculus, Nick ABSTAIN West\nCON Casey, Graham ABSTAIN Orton Longueville\nCON Lee, Matthew ABSTAIN Fletton\nCON Maqbool, Yasmeen ABSTAIN West\nCON Simons, George ABSTAIN Paston\nCON Sanders, David name heard but unable to hear response Eye & Thorney\nCON Allen, Sue name not heard Orton Waterville\nCON Cereste Marco name not heard Stanground Central\nCON McKean, Dale name not heard Eye & Thorney\nCON Walsh, Irene name not heard Stanground Central\nCON Dalton, Matthew NOT VOTING West\nCON Day, Sue NOT VOTING Paston\nCON Elsey, Gavin NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Fitzgerald, Wayne NOT VOTING Bretton North\nCON Goodwin, Janet NOT VOTING Orton Longueville\nCON Harper, Chris NOT VOTING Stanground East\nCON Hiller, Peter NOT VOTING Northborough\nCON Holdich, John (OBE) NOT VOTING Ghinton & Wittering\nCON Kreling, Pam NOT VOTING Park\nCON Lamb, Diane NOT VOTING Glinton & Wittering\nCON Nadeem, Mohammed NOT VOTING Central\nCON Nawaz, Gul NOT VOTING Ravensthorpe\nCON North, Nigel NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Peach, John NOT VOTING Park\nCON Rush, Brian NOT VOTING Stanground Central\nCON Scott, Sheila NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Seaton, David NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Serluca, Lucia NOT VOTING Fletton\nCON Stokes, June NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Thacker, Paula NOT VOTING Werrington South\nCON Todd, Marion NOT VOTING East\nCON Over, David NOT VOTING Barnack\nLAB Forbes, Lisa FOR Orton Longueville\nLAB Jamil, Mohammed FOR Central\nLAB Johnson, Jo FOR East\nLAB Khan, Nazim (MBE) FOR Central\nLAB Knowles, John FOR Paston\nLAB Martin, Stuart FOR Bretton North\nLAB Shabbir, Nabil FOR East\nLAB Shearman, John FOR Park\nLAB Thulbourn, Nick FOR Fletton & Woodston\nLAB Murphy, Ed FOR Ravensthorpe\nLAB Sylvester, Ann FOR Bretton North\nLD Fower, Darren FOR Werrington South\nLD Sandford, Nick FOR Walton\nLD Shaheed, Asif FOR Walton\nLD Davidson, Julia name heard but unable to hear response Werrington South\nPIF Miners, Adrian declared interest, so unable to vote Dogsthorpe\nPIF Ash, Christopher FOR Dogsthorpe PIF Fletcher, Michael FOR Bretton South\nPIF Fox, John FOR Werrington North\nPIF Fox, Judith FOR Werrington North\nPIF Harrington, David FOR Newborough\nPIF Saltmarsh, Christabel FOR Dogsthorpe\nPIF Sharp, Keith FOR North\nPIF Swift, Charles (OBE) FOR “but confused” North\nPIF Lane, Stephen name not heard Werrington North\nI found it very difficult indeed to pick up the voices of the Conservative councillors last night. It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_05_17_my-bank-holiday-and-a-filthy-fire-eleven-days-later/content_627.html": "Last week on Wednesday morning I wrote a post to celebrate the council’s repairing some broken bonfire links on its website. I’d found them on the May Day Bank Holiday when I had described a filthy fire which had rather spoiled the day.\nAt midday that same Wednesday I heard from the Strategic Regulatory Services Manager:\n“I understand from my Colleague XXX that you have enquired as to why no out of hours Pollution Control Service is provided by the Council. The Council though having a duty to provide a Pollution Control Service has no legal responsibility to provide an out of hours service I am afraid, the decision as to the level of resources put into providing the service and the hours it operates is one in law for the Council to decide. The Council to my knowledge has never provided a out of hours service and has certainly not during the last 7 years.\nIn what is an extremely challenging financial climate difficult decisions have to be made with regards to service provision, and that does result in services Pollution Control being no exception having to operate within financial constraints. From both an efficiency perspective, looking at the most effective use of staff time, and a financial one, budgets having already been set for the year, it is not possible to provide an out of hours service in Peterborough this year.\nIt is appreciated that at times having an officer on call may be helpful to a member of public, officers are however still able through planned measures, to operate when necessary at different in order to gain evidence of any offences being committed. In recent times officers have been able to attend a site at a weekend following prior arrangements in order to observe an illegal bonfire which was known to take place regularly, evidence obtained resulted in the case being put before the courts.\nIn your particular case XXX will continue to liaise with you over the problems you are experiencing.”\nThis response confirms the absence of any out of hours toxic fire procedure. It suggests that the council is content with this situation. If, as happened on Monday, the fire service tells the resident that use of their emergency number is not appropriate, the resident has no way to get a toxic fire put out.\nThen on Friday I the Pollution Control Officer said:\n“Following our conversation earlier this week, I can now provide an update on the issue of the bonfire.\nI have spoken to XXX from the Fire Brigade and he is reasonably confident that following the warnings given both by him and his colleagues to the person on site and the Fire Brigade’s action in extinguishing the fire, the problem is unlikely to recur at this particular site.\nGiven this, the council have decided not to take legal action at this time. The reasons for this are as follows:\n- The most useful legislation for dealing with bonfires is the Clean Air Act. However this Act only applies to “trade or industrial premises” or to waste being burned at a site as part of a business’ activities. The premises in question is a domestic property and there is no evidence that the waste was part of the activity of a business – certainly the fire brigade do not believe any of it was brought to the site from elsewhere and the landlord is (at the moment) essentially the occupier of the premises as it is vacant.\n- For domestic properties, the primary legislation is the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), which has two main provisions that apply here: Statutory Nuisance and the requirements in relation to duty of care and proper disposal of waste.\n- Statutory Nuisance law is rarely applied in ‘one-off’ circumstances because it is much easier to prove the existence (or likely occurrence/recurrence) of a nuisance if it has happened more than once.\n- Burning waste such as that which was burned on Monday is against the provisions laid down in the EPA for the proper disposal of waste. However, the burden for the success of legal action on this would fall very much on yourself and the fire officer as given that no officer of the council witnessed the event (for reasons I hope XXX has explained in his email to you) our effectiveness will be limited.\n- Additionally, there are a number of tests that must be applied to any intended legal action in order to ascertain whether it is reasonable and proportionate and in the public interest. The council believe that prosecuting an individual for a first offence of this nature is not reasonable or proportionate and would not be likely to result in a particularly harsh penalty to act as a deterrent.\nFor these reasons, it is not felt that the time, effort and cost required in taking a case to court are justifiable. Yesterday a hand-delivered letter was issued warning of the potential consequences of any further occurrence. Please can you continue to monitor the situation, and should there be a recurrence of the problem we will investigate the likely occurrence of a nuisance.\nShould you have any further questions please do not hesitate to get in touch. …”\nI am suggesting that we need a working procedure open and available to anybody who wants to get a toxic fire put out and investigated outside the council’s working hours.\nAs things stand I must dial 999 even though the fire service doesn’t consider these events merit an emergency call.\nOne thought on “My bank holiday and a filthy fire – eleven days later”",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_eu/content_528.html": "A petition launched apparently launched three weeks before Thursday’s decision of the UK electorate to Leave the EU has garnered over three million signatures since Thursday as I write at half past ten on Sunday morning.\nSomeone asked me:\n“I have 5 friends sharing this. The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\n- a statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\n- a statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\n- the revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\n- the loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\n- the loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\n- the exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\n- the exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\n- the exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\n- the possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\n- the likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\n- no plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\n- the awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\n- Leave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\n- Leave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\n- the growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.",

Leader of the Peterborough City Council, Wayne Fitzgerald, (featured in still my most popular post) has responded to Camcycle’s 2023 local election survey about active travel.\nYou can compare his and contrast his response, made without reference to ever having made an “active travel” journey, with the gritty realities encountered by someone travelling sustainably in Peterborough. Please elect Collette Francis, Bretton Oak defender and Green Party challenger in West ward.\nLike many residents, Collette Francis regularly uses walking and cycling routes around Peterborough and articulates very clearly the urgent need for improvements cycling and walking routes.\nGenerally, there is insufficient opportunity for voters to find out about the candidates on their ballot prior to an election. There is no exposure in local printed media once purdah begins. Local radio and TV coverage are losing their relevance to the city as studios disappear from our area, along with broadcast debate on the detail of local issues.\nIn Peterborough, there are barely any hustings. Many people don’t know what a hustings is and haven’t attended a local election hustings.\nElection surveys try to fulfil a similar role, enabling candidates’ responses to questions to be “seen” before the poll. Peterborough residents might like to compare the scarcity of responses to five questions from Peterborough candidates in twenty wards with the abundance and quality of answers to thirty nine from Cambridge candidates in sixteen wards! Cambridge voters won’t elect somebody who isn’t already engaged in sustainable travel issues. This is important for a city, which mostly travels by bike.\nActive Travel is a government department\nModes of travel which are “active” in government-speak are those which remain available to you even if the only power you have is that of your own body. They are good for health and wealth and, crucially, they don’t upset the climate or damage the planet. They are therefore what many people call “sustainable”.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough_page_6/content_725.html": "This is the speech I delivered to residents and activists at Park Ward Hustings on 15th April in the run up to the local elections on May 3rd – this is the uncut version\nWe live in Park Ward so we live in the heart of Peterborough\nI am delighted to be standing again in Park Ward this year. I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nJulie Howell, the Green Party’s mayoral candidate for the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (which includes Huntingdonshire) went to the Treasury in the snow to protest the underfunding of Peterborough.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.",

They were both on the panel alongside Chris Foulds and Bob Lawrence.\nThe organiser was the BBC and the Chair was Paul Stainton of Cambridgeshire’s Bigger Breakfast.\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) was invited to set out his stall. He is very keen that Peterborough City Council (Conservative) become a power generator and sell power to “our residents”. He thinks this would “give them some stability” and “we can control those prices”. He is fairly convinced that there isn’t much choice because otherwise “what are we going to do?” and it is the “duty of each councillor and council officer to get the best return..” He spent all of ten seconds on “£21M” and “£175M”. The first is “solar” and the other is the “entire project”.\nRichard Olive tried to explain that the projected figures didn’t add up. He wasn’t allowed to finish. It has to be said that Richard Olive is a firm believer in the interrupt and trample theory of communication. There is one problem with his approach though: although the assertion gets expressed and a familiar voice goes on air absolutely nothing then happens to what is said. In the lordly procession of chairman to the person next in his narrative it is a sort of burp. The possibility that he might be right or that it might be worth looking at the figures isn’t allowed to even hang suspended in space for a moment. The panel (50% Conservative) escapes scrutiny with the assistance of the BBC.\nPaul Stainton stands up, wandering about, while the “participating audience” sits down. Perhaps Richard Olive should have stood up and claimed a bit of space on a level with the Chair? It is after all difficult to trample from a sitting position.\nAs a veteran of the incinerator (anti) campaign and an observer of the hospital PFI fiasco it astounds me that anyone on Peterborough City Council can still get away with that phrase “commercial confidentiality”. If the council is the company (or effectively) where is the competition, where is the tender, where is the process? What could possibly be confidential?\nNobody asked. Something has to be very seriously wrong: when nobody\n- understands the process\n- bothers to explain it\n- knows what it is or\n- why it is there\nWhy does nobody ever challenge this preposterous pile of garbage? If someone fly-tipped vomit soaked nappies all over Cllr Nick Sandford (Liberal Democrat), would he actually mind? I think he would just say something Sandfordianly phlegmatic, smile and drift on.\nHow many more millions of pounds does the city council have to lose before Jo Public barges in? We know another massive financial blunder (or worse) is underway but everyone is determined to leave the curtain hanging up there. We need a little boy.\nWhy don’t other people feel their intelligence has been insulted by Cllr Cereste (Conservative) in particular? And patronised to the point of jaw on floor? “I do know that what’s on the table will secure him and his family for a long time to come.” Cllr Cereste (Conservative) knows much better than the sleepless farmer does what is best for the sleepless farmer.\nHow does this phenomenon get away with it? He hasn’t always been like that. Has he? Why isn’t he pursued by dung laden tractors?\nCllr Cereste (Conservative) spent another unchallenged (by Stewart Jackson MP Conservative) moment in the sun (lets be honest it is a Conservative sun, isn’t it) talking about £7M income per year and how that was a “very positive thing to do”.\nNobody pointed out that the residents of Peterborough might be being held to ransom over this. Or that there might be a conflict of interest for the council, (Conservative) or for Cllr Cereste (Conservative) or that all this lovely millions of money and tempting energy security from a terrifying nightmare of high prices (Conservatives role in creating said nightmare includes closing UK mines, privatising energy companies and selling the national grid) might be being laid out before us suckers “our residents” (Conservative) in the run up to an election.\nStewart Jackson MP (Conservative) then proceeded to list the procedural gaffes committed by the Peterborough City Council (Conservative).\nHe alleged\n- lack of transparency (no figures available to the residents of Peterborough and – because I couldn’t ask my second question the audience was able to rest secure in the assumption – to Stewart Jackson MP (Conservative) himself.\n- treatment of farmers (I’ll expand for him here: the council’s first communication to 18 farmers was to warn them that they would be evicted if the plan went ahead)\n- risk of a change in the subsidy regime: no safety plan if the government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) changes the regime governing ROCs (again no discussion: no explanation)\n- no contingency fund if the sums are wrong\n- conflict with government (Conservative with a little bit of Dem) policy on renewables (this was not explained at all)\n- has no plan B (if I may expand any decent proposal presents alternatives, preferably a well thought out range of options)\n- didn’t even know which brownfield sites it owned\nBob Lawrence was brilliant: a great relief talking about actual food production and the role of a tenant farm although Farming Today (which I often listen to) recently did a bit on how councils across the country are flogging them off or developing them and how much damage this could do to farming, small farms and new entrants to farming.\nWhat sadly didn’t get said at this point is that some councils are refusing to do this. I think Peterborough should be enthusiastically refusing to reduce its tenanted farm land holdings.\nOnce Paul Stainton said they were starting to wind up and I still hadn’t succeeding in asking any of my questions I decided that since I wasn’t actually required as a speaking participant, as I had expected, I wasn’t going to be part of any awful preorganised tedious windbag wind up. So I left and expressed my feelings as clearly as I possibly could (being at that point absolutely livid) to David Murray, radio editor.\nSo what questions would I have asked? I had two: the first was in response to Cllr Marco Cereste (Conservative). I wanted to ask him (and I’ll be honest I really wanted to ask this in front of a rolling TV camera):\n- Can you explain why you are not sure exactly how much income the solar voltaic array on the Freemans building is bringing in and why should anyone trust your figures if you are in the slightest bit uncertain on this point?\nAnd the other one was to Stewart Jackson. I wanted to ask him:\n- Whether or not public authorities (including Peterborough City Council) don’t have to disclose to our elected representative in parliament whatever information is requested of them and to confirm that he does actually have all the figures because he has asked the city council for them and they have been obliged to disclose them.\nPlease go to @PaulStainton or https://twitter.com/PaulStainton for more and use hashtag #solardebate\nPlease comment here if you don’t tweet or want more space",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_andy-coles/content_507.html": "Email sent to Cllr Holdich\nPlease Suspend Cllr Andy Coles!\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIf I was Jessica’s mum, what would I do?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nDemo for Andy Coles’ Resignation, Peterborough – Campaign …campaignopposingpolicesurveillance.com/event/demo-andy–coles…\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well.

I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\n- Jessica’s statement at the Police Spies Out of Lives and the PSOOL blog, 12 May 2017.\n- Paul Gravett, Andy Davey, the quiet spycop turned tory councillor an deputy police and crime commissioner, ARspycatcher, 12 May 2017.\n- Rob Evans, Cambridgeshire deputy police commissioner facing calls to resign over spy allegations, Guardian, 12 May 2017.\n- Simon Isreal, Police official under pressure to quit, Channel4 News, 12 May 2017.\nA biography is provided here: http://powerbase.info/index.php/Andy_Coles\nWhere the Met stands: re: previous similar but proved cases\nAll councillors inclined to agree with keeping Coles on their body should read this:\nhttp://news.met.police.uk/news/claimants-in-civil-cases-receive-mps-apology-138574\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\n— COPS (@copscampaign) July 25, 2017\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_referendum/content_558.html": "A petition launched apparently launched three weeks before Thursday’s decision of the UK electorate to Leave the EU has garnered over three million signatures since Thursday as I write at half past ten on Sunday morning.\nSomeone asked me:\n“I have 5 friends sharing this. The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\n- a statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\n- a statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\n- the revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\n- the loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\n- the loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\n- the exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\n- the exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\n- the exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\n- the possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\n- the likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\n- no plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\n- the awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\n- Leave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\n- Leave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\n- the growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_bonfire/content_693.html": "On Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf",

Follow Sustrans Peterborough on facebook. A member of the Werrington Running Club explained that the running club members use the bridge. While we were there the bridge was never empty: children were making their way to school: many pupils at Voyager school will get to school via this bridge and commuters were cycling and walking over it.\nOn top of the bridge, it ducks under the A47: the path descends a bit, making it an up and under bridge. It is an extraordinary design and in its day was very innovative. It is difficult to envisage a better design, given the continuous roar of traffic along the A47 crosses the Lincoln Road here: the main trunk route north out of Peterborough. Rhubarb Bridge (apparently so called because rhubarb kept coming up on its embankments when it was newly built) allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross two major roads on a set of off road, fully segregated paths, ramps and steps. There is absolutely no conflict with road traffic, which as things are, only stops for more road traffic.\nThe only road user who is not catered for, is (possibly) someone using a wheelchair or mobility scooter. There are ramps and they are certainly no steeper than many hills, but on the morning of our photoshoot, I did not see anyone attempt them in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter (which are very popular in Peterborough).\nUpdate 2: The two men who died between Yaxley and Farcet\nMy blog was partly about the alienating effect of cars and our road infrastructure and understanding why car parks and bridges over roads are chosen by suicidal (women, most often). As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.\n1 Peterborough awards the motorist absolute priority\nVery obviously and in my view outrageously, the absolute priority this city awards the motorist is demonstrated by this judgement just as it is in local infrastructure investment decisions, where roads for cars can always be funded, but decent routes for other forms of transport are consistently unaffordable.\nThe judge chose to reinforce this view by claiming he felt obliged to jail a woman who was on foot and in desperate need because: “I have to have regard for hundreds of motorists who were severely inconvenienced by her actions.”\nPhilippa breached a previous judicial order, so the judge had to do something. But Judge Noble jails her, apparently believing that the inconvenienced driving community somehow deserves this, or requires it of him.\nI drive a car and I don’t want this woman jailed. #NotInMyName. I’d like her released now. #FreePhilippa\nMost drivers are decent folk who would stop for someone who clearly needed help. This must be what they did that day, however unwilling. This delay was long, but delays on the road happen everyday.\nIn this case the risk of a fatal outcome for Philippa was very high, but thank goodness, diligent caring people helped avert it. So why jail Philippa when the best possible result was achieved by the large number of people, including local emergency services and all those drivers who stopped, however inconvenient, to help make sure that someone’s life was protected at a lethal moment?\nGood question.\nPhilippa was sent to prison early this morning. As I writing this and going about my day, two young men died at the hands of a hit and run motorist in Yaxley on a patch of road where spending on a cycleway/footpath has allegedly been put off for a whole decade. But the money for the brand new road which underpasses that same road was found. However, just as happened when the old road was built, not quite enough for a pavement or cycle way.\nPeterborough has created a problem for itself and it was not Philippa’s fault.\n2 Peterborough is one of the most dangerous places to be on the road\n3 Peterborough only cares about shopping and getting to work\nGiven that the city’s second priority after the private motor vehicle is earning enough money to shop and then to do your shopping, which all too often means buying and driving a car, road traffic is a massive problem for most people, whether or not they are experiencing emotional distress and whether or not they happen to be in a car at a particular moment. It is not all about accidents. It is also about air pollution and life expectancy. It is about quality of life. And how much of a person’s life is eaten up travelling.\nI don’t think it is an accident that historically women (mostly) have chosen the city’s car parks to express their despair. Queensgate’s car parks only service the retail sector and they shut as the shops close. Women find places which reflect their feelings.\nPhilippa is not alone. Her behaviour is not unique to her. Unhappy women have been telling Peterborough very important but not very nice things about how we are restricted and tied down by the way we live. But the city doesn’t listen. And I suspect that Judge Noble really doesn’t want to hear those awful truths.\nIf I’m right, that isn’t Philippa’s fault.\n4 Peterborough does not have a working public transit system\nNon ownership of a car in Peterborough renders you virtually unemployable, a phenomenon never experienced by residents of cities with working public transit systems. Here it makes you a non person. Something not worthy of consideration.\nSo often people are trapped in a vicious cycle of having to have a car. Another group of people is stuck outside the car owning circle. A huge number of people can’t or don’t drive a car but the transport needs of this very diverse group (including children) are not taken care of. Their chances and opportunities can be massively compromised, because they experience travel only as a passenger in someone else’s vehicle, not as something they can embark upon autonomously.\nThe systems we put up with affect everyone’s happiness. Not just Philippa’s. Roads affect the map and our relationships with one another. They define and divide communities. Some of Peteborough’s roads are hideous.\nWhen our environment is neglected and fails to support people’s needs, it has an impact on our health and happiness.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault either.\n5 Peterborough does not have an effective mental health system\nIf Philippa had been discharged from effective mental health care she would not have ended up back in court.\nThat isn’t Philippa’s fault, obviously.\n6 Peterborough is angry\nA judge finds himself in an impossible position. Judges have to be very professional and aren’t supposed to express their emotions. But I think it might be well worth trying to imagine what it would really feel like to be a judge faced with Philippa. Suppose I was the judge.\nI’d feel disappointment that Philippa has landed back in court. Disappointed for her, because I know that failure is bad and hurts and she will be hurting.I’d be trying to see how she is, and trying to figure out what on earth went wrong. And disappointed for myself and the court, because the very fact that she is standing in front of me means that what we did last time didn’t work, or didn’t work well enough.\nSo I’d be quite annoyed too and probably cross with her. She didn’t have to do this, did she? We gave her a chance, but she hasn’t taken it. She’s gone the wrong way and landed up back in front of me. I’d be irritated and I might be inclined to lose patience.\nAnd how come she’s been discharged from mental health care but done it again? What is wrong with the health care system? Why can’t they get it right? One row and she’s completely destabilised? How come? What kind of discharge was it? What strategies did they give her? Did they get anything right? I’d be furious that they were so useless.\nBut being a judge, I would of course be very very good at managing my emotions, keeping them firmly under control, being objective, turning them into something positive, like sport or a hobby. Because someone probably taught me how to do that. A chap’s ability with his own emotions is partly why he is a judge.\nI might be aware of what Philippa thinks she needs, but not necessarily. It seems to me that a judge, faced with terrible distress finds himself equipped with all the wrong tools. I might well feel annoyed about what my judge options were. What I’ve got is a sledgehammer.\nWhat Philippa needs and probably knows she needs are the sort of things you would find in a properly functioning hospital (eg not one like Peterborough – on permanent alert). A nurse, probably medication, time, secure spaces, counselling and therapy, companionship, advice, training, reflection, perspective. Things which are far more akin to needle and thread.\nOur Peterborough judge knew this morning that the tools and resources which might help repair Philippa are not available in our city. You can’t refer someone to a non existent or inadequate service. She has already been discharged from what has been made available to her and our judge can see that one family conversation has been enough to plunge her back into misery. I’d be livid if the judge was me.\nBut of course it was Judge Noble. Yes he has got all the sledgehammer might of the law and he isn’t going to get all emotional. But the trouble with the law is that it imagines that a desperately unhappy person is capable of caring a single jot about it. It is so vain. All systems are like that: they all believe that it is about them. That is how people get crushed utterly. We all know that.\nOf course everybody knows that nobody in desperate need should be required to defer to the paramount needs of any system. Systems should work with those in need. Systems all have policies which say that this is exactly what they do. But we also all know that in practice they don’t.\nThere is a 100% chance that the judge knows that as well as I do, and again, if it was me, I’d be even crosser. I’d be twenty times crosser than I ever ever get in real life.\nAnd that in my opinion is why the actual Judge Noble jailed her. Sending Philippa to prison was not about her. It was all about him. If Philippa was a such pain in the neck to a bunch of motorists, what terrible trouble will she cause in prison? And why would anyone burden an hopelessly overloaded prison service with someone who will cause nothing but obstructions and delays within it?\nPutting Philippa very gently to one side, frankly, it isn’t fair on the prison service.\nThere simply is no rational explanation for jailing Philippa.\nBut we don’t need a rational explanation, do we? Becasue we can all see straight through an angry, impotent, frustrated system, can’t we ladies? We know how hard it is to mend something bigger than you, compared with how easy it is to smash something smaller.\n7 Peterborough is a hot spot for female vulnerability\nLastly but very importantly, Peterborough is a hot spot of female vulnerability, where retaining your personal integrity can prove fatal. Women are required to support the system and to do its bidding, even to their own undoing. The cure here is not the council. The cure is usually other women: people who can and must help and support one another. Women who have seen and befriended a lot of women suffering know the extent to which Philippa is not alone. But it is impossible to understand that you are actually in excellent company while you are still suffering. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the law or do its bidding. These realisations come only once people are able emerge out of a crisis.\nMy wish for Philippa is that recovery and this realisation come soon. Maybe, crazily it will come for her in prison, the right thing even if in completely the wrong place. I hope that the penny will drop quickly that she is OK. Yes, she is unhappy and probably quite unwell. But she is absolutely not the problem and she is in the company of a huge number of wonderful people, wherever she is, including prison.\nPlease be sure that wherever women find themselves especially vulnerable, so do a lot of other people and your readers are far too clever to assume that what I describe is only about or for women.\nMy January 2015 post received quite a bit of feedback and I realised that I was wrong about what the remedy is. Or at any rate that what I believed I meant was capable of being misunderstood. So, I don’t believe that the city needs a Clerk of Works any more. I believe that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works. I didn’t update my blog at the time (I often don’t) but now that the issue of budgets and management of major infrastructure projects at Peterborough City Council will be making headlines again, I am correcting my recommended solution so as to make absolutely clear to decision makers what I believe Peterborough needs.\nI learned last year that technically – i.e. on paper, legally, contractually and presumably somewhere in its accounts spreadsheet the council can actually claim to “have” a Clerk of Works. But also that (astonishingly) that function is currently performed by an employee or employees of the contractor doing the job and is not necessarily even a single nameable person. It may be “contractually normal” to organise a clerk of works function like this: I am told it is. But to my mind it is a notion, provided in the contract, but where it sits in any practical sense and who performs the function and why these persons unknown’s first loyalty should be our council and how the council can hold them accountable (for example by sacking them) is all shrouded in mystery. So a Clerk of Works is effectively useless: like a button floating free of the shirt, as it were.\nI believe now that what the city needs is an In House Clerk of Works who must be a member of Peterborough City Council’s staff, on their payroll and their payroll only and 100% and solely accountable to Peterborough City Council. I believe that role should be filled by a highly qualified person (i.e., they might have at least one civil engineering degree). They should be paid a professional and competitive salary and that the job should be advertised publicly and include local advertisements and the appointment process should be open to scrutiny within the council’s audit and compliance procedures.\nThe In House Clerk of Works I envisage would be supported by a planning department within the city council with immediate access to council archives and records. It is not good enough for planning staff to be located in one place and the documents in another. It is very difficult for members of the public to cope with the current system. How members of staff cope with using it on a daily basis beats me. I remain suspicious about how the Fletton Parkway contaminated land managed to come as a surprise to the Fletton Parkway Widening Project team:\nThe In House Clerk of Works should be empowered to scrutinise and halt any and all jobs done for the council at any stage in the application, approval and completion processes and to withhold sign off and payment until all the council’s quality standards are met. I hate seeing money being spent on works which are shoddy and unpleasing to the eye and hearing about decisions which nobody realised were as bad as they were at the time.* It does nothing for our local environments, which we pay good money to empower our councils to improve. And it does even less for our self respect as a city.\nIncidentally, taking down a wood or removing a green space is not a neutral act. In an Environment City you’d expect it to be considered especially controversial. But in addition to basic ecological concerns, woodland has long been used to conceal problems with the soil. Where you can’t grow a crop, farmers and landowners will often grow trees which will perform all sorts of useful functions within a landscape. Perhaps the cost of removing these particular patches of woodland and scrub will teach Peterborough to respect its green spaces and what they are actually doing a little more? We are often told by people who don’t realise we depend upon it and that we live in it that we “can’t afford” the environment. Perhaps this wacky but all too widespread reasoning informed the decision to widen Fletton Parkway? But in the city with the highest dependency on cars, it is likely that a £6M overspend (on top of what was originally budgeted) will be seen as “unavoidable” and “necessary”, because building a bigger road network remains at the uncontested top of Peterborough’s spending priorities.\n*For example:\nthe decision to turn one third of the A1139 parkway lights off and damaging whole lengths of under road cabling in the process, leaving a lethal bright stretch followed by a dark stretch, a bright stretch and another dark stretch. This light and dark lighting phenomenon (particularly noticeable near Stanground) happened all around the city because decision makers failed to check with the relevant qualified electrician what the impact of removing those particular light bulbs would be. In order to put it right all the affected lengths of road would have to be dug up.\nReturning for her second lunchtime performance at St John’s this month, pianist Irena Radić is joined by violinist Freya Goldmark in a concert of some of the finest music for violin and piano written by French composers. The highlight will be a performance of Franck’s thrilling Sonata in A Major, but we’ll also hear works by composers such as Debussy and Lili Boulanger.\nAs usual the café will be open from noon, serving a range of hot drinks and homemade cakes, scones etc. All profits from the café will go to The Green Backyard.\nThe concert will begin promptly at 1pm. Admission is free, but those who are able to afford it are asked to make a donation. The suggested amount is £4.\nAbout Freya:\nFreya Goldmark has performed extensively in the UK, not least at Sandringham in front of Prince Charles, in Europe (including Russia, and live on Norwegian…\nFlute Concert at 1pm at St John The Baptist in Cathedral Square, Peterborough\nThis concert is the third in a summer concert series organised by St Johns CIC. Hannah Clark will be joined by Irena Radić. Both of these young musicians have given concerts at St John’s before. In their début appearance here together Hannah Clark (flute) and Irena Radić (piano) will play music by Fauré, Ravel, Reinecke, and more…\nThe church will be open from about midday and arriving early ensures time for a homemade cake or a coffee. All profits go to The Green Backyard.\nThe concert will begin promptly at 1pm. Admission is free, but those who are able to afford it are asked to make a donation. The suggested amount is £4.\nYou can also spend some time with the magnificent textile work, Mapestry, installed in St John’s as part of this year’s magnificent PECT Green Festival. Mapestry will be in the church for a short while, and then it will tour the route of the River Nene which passes through the city. The work consists of twelve delightfully characterful panels, each one describing a month in the year and a place on the Nene. The work has been created by Froglife a major wildlife charity based in Peterborough and a number of community crafters. Nenescape is a Heritage Lottery funded Landscape Partnership Scheme conserving and protecting the Nene Valley’s natural and built history. Get in touch with them if you think you can help. A woman in a red dress is walking her dog in Ferry Meadows:\n“Peterborough needs The Broadway Theatre, it does not need more flats. Peterborough City Council should refuse to entertain the idea of the theatre being converted into flats, and robbing us all of a sparkling jewel in Peterborough’s crown. The Broadway is good enough for Bill Kenwright to use for his legendary productions, and is a massive asset to the city. The theatre must remain as an entertainment venue.” says Barry.\nWhile out I learned that the police or the government (depending which story you read) were investigating a possible fraud to do with the people who had signed the petition: some of whom didn’t live in the UK and some of whom were apparently surplus to the entire populations of whole countries, so presumably might consist only of an email address. 77,000 false signatures had apparently been removed. Variations on this tale are numerous but you have to go to twitter for a laugh.\nIncidentally isn’t it wonderful that a Leave petition is being so enthusiastically embraced by the Remain side? Perhaps the petitions office should have let the No Confidence in David Cameron petition get a debate? Looking back, it might have been an easier way for him to leave office and the office might not have been left in quite such an appalling mess.\nA petition launched apparently launched three weeks before Thursday’s decision of the UK electorate to Leave the EU has garnered over three million signatures since Thursday as I write at half past ten on Sunday morning.\nSomeone asked me:\n“I have 5 friends sharing this. The problems are that (a) referendums are terrible ways to decide complex questions and (b) why? Because we didn’t think the first time?”\nI started to respond, but decided I should blog my thoughts.\nOn point a) I agree entirely and on point b) I have rather a lot to say:\nAround half of the people who voted in this referendum won’t have voted the last time they had an opportunity to vote. Turnouts in elections are closer to 30 % than to 70%. And when people vote, the majority of voters understand that their vote won’t matter. (The exception is voting for a member of the European Parliament whose elections are proportional: in all other UK elections all votes cast for everyone except the First Past The Post are 100% useless, even if those votes tot up to 80% of all votes cast.) Very few elections are hotly contested because so many seats are sewn up. There is a massive chasm between the elected and the electorate and the group elected is less and less representative of the people they are supposed to represent. However that does not stop them claiming an electoral mandate to pursue policies which are increasingly extreme, divisive and socially damaging and disrespectful to voters whose candidate did not win. There used to be some protection from the left wing of British politics, but that is another story.\nSo huge numbers of people customarily don’t vote or vote only to protest, knowing perfectly well that their vote can’t and won’t elect anything remotely resembling what they want. The shock of some Leave voters “I didn’t think my vote would matter” is genuine. In a national referendum, all votes are transferred and only the total matters, which means every single vote counts. For many people (not me: I’m too old!) this is a first.\nThe Leave campaign must have been delighted that the Remain campaign handed them the opportunity to Kick Cameron Out. Some people will have voted Leave in order to depose the PM. (What on earth did a UK PM think he was doing taking sides at all, let alone monopolising the leadership of it? But I will look at the various issues with the Remain campaign in another blog).\nThe last UK referendum was for Alternative Vote, where half the people who campaigned for electoral reform voted to preserve the status quo rather than move to an inadequate alternative voting system, which even most electoral reform campaigners didn’t like. The AV campaign was run cataclysmically badly and the status quo was run by real professionals. The stuff AV campaigners were expected to put through letter boxes was outrageously amateur. I imagine a vast amount went in the bin. I personally regretted the time I put into it. The majority would have been better served had we moved to a less than perfect AV system, but not many people understood that and far fewer cared.\nIt turns out these are the guys who ran the Anti AV referendum campaign were the ones picked to run the Remain campaign. This looked like a massive asset as the campaigns set off. The status quo campaign was far better.\nAnd working with the Remain campaign has been a revelation: I have literally never worked in a campaign which had adequate resources.\nSo, if you habitually run things badly and people learn to dismiss the whole system and then you pose a serious question, which will make a real difference you are likely to have a problem, whatever the result.\nWhat we have now is:\na statement of our desire to own our own crown and government (which we failed to accept we had all the time)\na statement of our hatred, fear and loathing for everything which is new to us or looks or sounds foreign\nthe revelation to the world that we are abie to blame all the problems we have created ourselves on the foreign, the strange or whatever we don’t understand (the Leave campaign centred honestly on immigration and the emotions it called out to are exactly those those which fire racism and persecution of minorities world wide)\nthe loss of our credibility as a competent, well run state\nthe loss of overseas influence in international government, business and academia\nthe exposure to the whole world of the shameful social, wealth, opportunity, education divisions which cut across the country and led to a howl of agony, engineered by the bunch of pro austerity privatising millionaires who led the Leave campaign. The BBC prior to the result expected a different geographical split, but the result showed a quite different wealth and education based reality.\nthe exposure to the whole world that the majority of the UK electorate don’t trust experts: i.e. people with degrees, qualifications, training or any status or authority within the society we have already built. We should all know, but clearly we don’t that this is a group the Nazis targeted.\nthe exposure to the whole world of the political ignorance of the UK electorate and the extent to which it can be misled by a partial press and can’t judge for itself (politics was not taught to some of the generations who have just cast their votes and history as a subject in many schools is becoming a tiny minority subject)\nthe possible loss of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the consequential end of the United Kingdom\nthe likely loss of London as the first choice for service and finance businesses – including banks – wanting to operate in Europe\nno plan whatsoever for the future from the Leave campaign\nthe awakening realisation that the Leave campaign was constructed on some very big fat lies\nLeave supporters were told there would be £350M per week for the NHS – campaign leaders claimed that this was the amount we gave to Brussels and consistently refused to correct it. Farage has now admitted it was not true.\nLeave supporters were repeatedly told that the European Parliament was less democratic than Westminster. This looks a bit hollow, given the responses of each to date. In Europe there is a suspension of committee work on Monday and a plenary on Tuesday. In England the unseating of the two main party leaders replaces business as usual.\nthe growing awareness that points made by the Remain campaign, dismissed by Leave as “Project Fear” might have had a point\nAll this is beginning to sink in. As is the narrowness of the victory in numerical terms. And the understanding that what is left of the British Empire was not even mentioned, let alone given a vote.\nThis referendum was all about the Tory Party.\nEvery organisation worthy of the name has two plans: one in the event of a Remain vote and one in the event of a Leave vote. I met a partner of an organisation which by now will have completed moving its headquarters to Brussels (from London) because even the risk of a Leave vote threatened its future operations (which involve the whole of Europe). Each organisation will be quantifying a different set of risks and costs and benefits. This particular company was light, small and easy to shift and it could always come back if it really wanted to: but that is not going to happen if the UK leaves and stays out of the EU. Other, less agile businesses, like heavy engineering will have to take short term hits because they can’t move so fast and they will be looking longer term at Europe and its outlook as a whole. They may look at the EU area and think to themselves, if this vast wealthy area can’t build homes for its own citizens (the UK government does not allow local councils to build much needed social housing) or cope constructively and humanely with an emergency refugee crisis, what point is there in us staying here?\nI am horrified and ashamed that my country is deciding to not contribute constructively to Europe’s challenges and instead has engineered a way for a badly led and badly educated electorate to push the entire population, including groups to whom the vote matters critically into darkness on its own.\nPeople are enjoying crashing the government’s petition website. Some of them probably work on systems which take 45 minutes to log a fly tipping problem.\nBut I hold hands with an organisation which is ready to tackle climate change. To the challenge of climate change this ghastly decision is an extremely unhelpful but distracting gnat bite. I am incredibly proud of Green Party councillors who are ready for this and for the other moments of complete insanity which we know we will have to face if we don’t radically change the way we live and do politics.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_councillor_page_4/content_449.html": "This is the speech I delivered to residents and activists at Park Ward Hustings on 15th April in the run up to the local elections on May 3rd – this is the uncut version\nWe live in Park Ward so we live in the heart of Peterborough\nI am delighted to be standing again in Park Ward this year. I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nJulie Howell, the Green Party’s mayoral candidate for the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (which includes Huntingdonshire) went to the Treasury in the snow to protest the underfunding of Peterborough.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.",

March was the eleventh consecutive month in which global sea and air temperatures broke records.\nWhy does voting independent in Park Ward makes sense this year? Because what I said in my address to voters last year remains true this year: Park Ward has exactly the same problems. But this year we have even more challenges and we need to start by describing them honestly.\nLast year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nHowever, what I said last year about what needs doing in Park Ward has not changed. Park Ward still suffers from the same problems, so please re-read last year’s address. But this year I’m adding a couple of things:\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.\nThis year I am standing as an independent candidate in Peterborough\nPolice and Crime Commissioner, Peterborough City Council and several parish council elections will be held on Thursday 2nd May. But this time, I am standing in Park Ward as an independent politician. This means that I can set my own campaign priorities and ignore group think and party lines. If elected, I would be free to vote only for those policies and decisions which would improve the lives of my constituents and which I personally agreed with.\nI supported Councillor Kirsty Knight’s successful Green Party campaigns last year. This year she is fighting to retain her seat for the first time as an independent councillor. This takes great courage and I respect her hugely for her decision. I endorse, am supporting, and will continue to support Kirsty after what I very much hope will be another victory and another campaign first. Please vote for and support Kirsty, who in her first term has already established herself as an outstanding city councillor.\nCollette Francis (who campaigned energetically for the Bretton Oak Tree and joined the Greens) is also standing in West as an independent candidate. As a serving parish councillor interested and competent in paperwork and planning, I am confident Collette will make a superb city councillor. Please vote for and support Collette.\nLastly, thank you to all those who have helped and tried to help during the past few months. I have heard every word and I appreciate all you have done and said. Thank you.\nWho is observing, and who is maybe not even noticing the visible and costly effects of climate change in Peterborough? A clue might have landed on your doormat.\nI walked through Central Park recently and realised that nearly every single box had died. I took a couple of photos intending to write to the council and promptly forgot.\nThen, thanks to Angus Ellis I received a useful reminder. Thank you, Angus.\nThe reminder arrived in the form of a Labour and Co-operative Party leaflet suggesting I vote for Angus who is this party’s candidate in Park Ward. It dropped on my doormat and I eventually got round to reading it. I discovered a very rare picture of Park Ward Councillor Mohammed Samir (who, along with another Ravensthorpe councillor is not profligate with his words or his image) at the bottom right of page three. And even more surprising, there, in front of his frown and rising up the bank behind him is scorched, brown and dead or dying box hedging, telling every sharp eyed reader in Park Ward the very sad story about its own highly likely extinction.\nWeather conditions are increasingly brutal and this pattern of intemperate weather (part of our new, not so temperate climate) is particularly cruel to box, a key evergreen parks and gardens hedging plant. Long periods of extreme drought alternating with non stop record rainfall will have stressed this along with many other plants, including many of Central Park’s trees.\nSlowly, since 2007 when it was first recorded in the UK, the box moth has been travelling north (it began its very long journey somewhere in South East Asia!) and here it is: rampaging across Peterborough. It noticed it in my garden only last summer. It probably reached the park before that.\nI wrote to the council this morning to ask that the dead box bushes are dug out. A very sad job for those who tended them. It used to be good gardening practice to burn diseased and infested plants. These days, hot composting (we have brown garden bins for that in Peterborough) will probably do the job of disinfection.\nI have also been thinking about what needs doing in Central Park to deal with the loss of the lovely robust evergreen structure which the box has provided for many years around Central Park’s beds and along paths. Evergreens are particularly important in winter, when so many plants are bare.\nReplacement structural evergreen hedging can’t be planted safely in Spring or Summer (October is the very earliest sensible time) and until then at the earliest, removing dead plants will open the beds up to unwanted foot traffic: both pet and human.\nFast growing decorative annual flowers might have time to provide protective ground cover until a decision is made on whether and how to replace.\nI would be very surprised if there is one plant which could do what the extraordinary and now at risk box did for all the park’s flower beds, since the conditions in each bed are increasingly varied: some are very very dry (memorial gardens) and others around the outer path are shady and one or two occasionally waterlogged. Decisions could be complicated.\nSeeding with forget-me-not (on damper beds) and/or nasturtium (round the top of the dry memorial garden).\nAnd if a decision is made to retain hedge type edging, which plants might work well in the various conditions to be found in different beds around the park?\nI think that rosemary might work around the memorial garden. It doesn’t mind neglect and drought and responds to drought by flowering (all year round!!) if dry. It doesn’t mind being on a bank which will lose rainwater. It can be clipped (min twice a year) into a very beautiful and sturdy box type hedge. But it probably shouldn’t go in straight away: there will be too much box moth around and it’s definitely a second choice target!\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nA first impression of the BBC’s breaking news coverage of the Rochdale Review commissioned by Andy Burnham\nPurely by chance I tuned in over breakfast to BBC News where the Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Stephen Watson was in the middle of apologising for the force’s shortcomings in dealing with reports of child abuse in Rochdale. He was responding to ‘the Mayor‘s review’ or, to give it its full name, ‘The review into Operation Span and the investigation of non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’ which has just been published. The next speaker was Rochdale Council leader Councillor Neil Emmott, the leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, who also apologised for what the council had got wrong.\nNext came three women, each of whom had headed up an organisation working with the thousands of (mostly female and very young) victims of human trafficking and sexual abuse. (nobody’s names came up from start to finish). The first woman had been through the barrier known as the end of one’s tether, her hair got in her way, and she was gasping for air and needed water, but she was clearly a warrior and won my respect for getting out in short order the horrible truths she needed to speak.\nThe second woman was wearing a very smart cream dress and had her hair and make up done: full Manchester female in armour, elegantly equipped equally for the dance floor, lifting someone up out of the gutter, or take her presentation to any board room or civic assembly rooms of the city prepared to listen to what goes on in the darkest corners of the city: where corruption, physical, emotional and psychological abuse and the systemic collusion of letting offenders go: the institutional joint enterprise (how come that is not an offence, she asks?) of deliberately letting known and identified criminals walk free.\nShe struck a line through the whole of the older Oldham predecessor report, revealing that during that investigation, only one victim had been able to speak to the reviewers. It’s people like her I want to see working where they can do what is needed: in the House of Lords.\nThen, just as the third woman, in a dark suit began speaking, she was rudely interrupted by a far more important man: Grant Schapps, talking about the state of the world and threats had multiplied and increased in severity during the horrible reign of his own ghastly Tory Party. I have no idea what the third woman wanted to say.\nHow dare the BBC cut this third woman short? They had three channels they could have used. BBC1, BBC2 and BBCNews. The handling of this press release was outrageous. Instead 10 Downing St was able to shut up a woman speaking on matters of concern to every woman and child and every decent man in the UK.\nI think I might have to complain to the BBC. Three news channels.\nWhat happened to the third woman’s voice, please?\nCan anyone figure out where the broadcast continued?\nWho has broadcast what she said, please?\nMeanwhile, I search for Rochdale report on Youtube and, depressingly, I find:\nThe Nene is in flood, still transporting last summer and autumn’s above average rainfall to the Wash and new steadily heavy El Niño winter rain. Since my third update the Conservative administration at Peterborough City Council has been toppled and a well intentioned but inexperienced ex opposition multi party Cabinet is trying to keep the council’s finances afloat and to fix whatever has been going wrong. The council is under supervision by the body which will take over from elected representatives if Peterborough follows Northamptonshire County Council (2018) and goes bust.\nThe notorious collapse of Henry Penn Walk continues, visible to anybody walking over the bridge between Peterborough Town Hall on Bridge Street and the council offices at Sand Martin House. Read my previous updates for the history of this persistently unremedied collapse.\nThe eponymous sand martins once nested in crumbly banks of the river and their history is recorded in a planning objection to the flats which now tower from (probably, but to be honest, I’m not 100% sure) the relative solidity of old power station foundations.\nDoes the ownership of the path really matter? It is well and truly flooded and the state of it is documented photographically and is a topic of scandalised comment in I Love Peterborough on Facebook\nSurely what matters is that somehow an embankment was “built” (if such a miserable structure is worthy of such a determined verb) in such a way that it gave way completely, provoking shock and worry among observers. Did it pass building regulations? Who signed it off? Who allowed the council to patch it, if it never belonged to the council? How did the company which built it manage to go bust, (if it did)? Why won’t the council serve an injunction? So many questions.\nAnd on the other side of the river, a set of even bigger buildings, built just as meanly close to the water.\nTake a walk on those pavements on the other side. Tell me if you think you are walking on a nice flat surface. What is the quality of the steps down onto this new embankment? How does this walk make you feel?",

And tomorrow (assuming it is signed tomorrow)?\nHave you checked whether or not the council considered options other than incineration? What evidence of careful consideration of other options are you relying on? Are you aware that the council has been consistently challenged on this since 2007, (and possibly earlier)?\nAre you aware that the business cases for incineration in general and for this particular incinerator are both now being challenged as unsafe (the economy and the market having changed substantially)? Have you considered the financial impact on council tax payers should these cautions turn out to be well founded? And that if the business performs as badly as expected are you aware of the likely impact on recycling, too?\nHas the contract been set up in such a way that it can attract structural or grant funding? Or has it been set up in such a way that it is ineligible?\nAre you aware of the total cost of this contract? Figures of £76M and £80M have been quoted recently in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph for the capital costs alone. Is that figure current? What are the overall 30 year costs for this project? Is it acceptable that this information is still not in the public domain? Is it acceptable that innocent readers of their local paper might assume that this figure is the total cost of the project?\nAre you aware that the council is deliberately choosing out of date technology and describing it as “tried and tested”? (the information on technology is still not in the public domain).\nAre you aware that the council might be comparing the energy recovery of its own plant with Scandinavian examples? If so are you aware that in Scandinavia (which is used to colder weather and historically much more aware of the importance of insulation and energy security) high performance hot water supply grids are planned in (eg for swimming pools or district heating). Peterborough has not planned a supply grid and has not explained who will buy energy and power generated by this incinerator. Have you seen an example of the output and recovery figures from either Peterborough’s as planned and have you compared that with an operational equivalent in Scandinavia and an operational equivalent in the UK (local campaigners are finding that those in the UK can’t sell their power).\nAre you aware that the UK’s statutory regulatory regime for air pollution (in which the council has placed its trust) is widely regarded as unfit for purpose? The Health Protection Agency is about to undertake research into whether or not it can substantiate the assurances and claims it has been making and upon which the Environment Agency and numerous councils have historically relied. Is the council aware of the potential damage it could do to its own Environment Capital “aspiration” if, as widely expected, it can’t?\nDo you know enough about air pollution and monitoring in the city? Does Peterborough monitor anything other than road traffic? Where are the monitoring stations and are they in the right places? What regime is planned for when the incinerator is operational?\nHave you considered the social, health and cost impacts on the city of a mass burn incinerator in an area with very high (and rising) levels of social deprivation?\nAre you aware that a new incinerator on an industrial site in Fletton is operating and is apparently making people ill, but that the council has not done anything about it, and that not one person amongst the “officers’ panel” and members present at the Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee Call in Meeting on 29th August was equipped to advise the ward councillor who asked about this problem in his ward? I understand that the ward councillor had been told by the Environment Agency that it was a matter for the council. As a member of the public I witnessed that not a single person actually knew how to deal with this relatively small problem – nobody offered to look into it or explain who the ward councillor should talk to, if it wasn’t the Environment Agency. This is despite the presence of senior council officers and (at least) three lawyers.\nAre you satisfied with the monitoring and regulation of pollution in the city?\nPlease can Richard Olive have answers to the questions which Peterborough Friends of the Earth has asked the council on this matter?\nCan you write NONE against – or otherwise provide detail of any personal, family or party interest you have had, have or are likely to have – in any of the following:\n- the council’s Energy Services Company?\n- “Blue Sky”?\n- this sector?\n- this decision?\nI look forward to hearing from you, etc.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_environment/content_78.html": "If you live in Park Ward and your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nI am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again. Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.",

This one from Cllr John Shearman (here he is).\nFirst of all he apologises for not replying sooner. Frankly speediness of response is not the most important thing to me. And since I wrote about a jargon-prone subject which most people would find technical, difficult and tedious an over speedy response really wouldn’t impress me.\nBut offering an apology for responding within a week achieves so much. Starting like this says to me (these are my words, not his) “Hello, I am a human being with manners and I understand the common courtesies. Moreover I have standards: they are mine and…..”\nI don’t need to go on. And nor will I copy onto my blog the content of his response or our subsequent conversations. That would be impolite: he has expressed himself to me honestly, frankly and (absolutely critically important to me, and to anything relating to planning) he comes over as open-minded and prepared to listen. That is what I think people expect of a ward councillor.\nAnd, best of all, from what he says I can see that he has done his homework and understands the incinerator campaign work which has being quietly going on in the city. His email is a very tiny but very concise executive summary of how the situation actually is. Hats off.\nThank you, John.\nI am still waiting for a response from the third of my ward councillors.",

It needed to act when the residential developer was ready to rent or sell.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nAn event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).\nI attended an event last Thursday which was about Rhubarb Bridge, but before I post anything about that, this is just a little news about the next bridge over the A47 going east (towards Wisbech). This bridge is on Highways England’s list of repairs and should be getting some much needed attention very soon. I hope it isn’t closed for long. It is certainly not planned for demolition. It is a useful bridge enabling cyclists and pedestrians to shortcircuit (North /South) one of Peterborough’s oddest and most confusing roundabouts over and onto the A47 (as it goes East/West).\n@SustransPBoro and Peterborough Cycling Forum members gathered this week to protest against the proposal (announced in the council’s budget) to demolish Rhubarb Bridge. Follow Sustrans Peterborough on facebook. A member of the Werrington Running Club explained that the running club members use the bridge. While we were there the bridge was never empty: children were making their way to school: many pupils at Voyager school will get to school via this bridge and commuters were cycling and walking over it.\nOn top of the bridge, it ducks under the A47: the path descends a bit, making it an up and under bridge. It is an extraordinary design and in its day was very innovative. It is difficult to envisage a better design, given the continuous roar of traffic along the A47 crosses the Lincoln Road here: the main trunk route north out of Peterborough. Rhubarb Bridge (apparently so called because rhubarb kept coming up on its embankments when it was newly built) allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross two major roads on a set of off road, fully segregated paths, ramps and steps. There is absolutely no conflict with road traffic, which as things are, only stops for more road traffic.\nThe only road user who is not catered for, is (possibly) someone using a wheelchair or mobility scooter. There are ramps and they are certainly no steeper than many hills, but on the morning of our photoshoot, I did not see anyone attempt them in a wheelchair or a mobility scooter (which are very popular in Peterborough).\nPeterborough in Transition Launched last night\nA large and varied gathering of young and old enjoyed a superb evening.\nA couple of trailers wetted our appetites for up-coming films.\nThe notorious acoustics of the town hall’s Reception Room didn’t help: with groups of people gathered round themed tables for discussion and note taking. Those with any hearing difficulties at all struggled, even when listening to those around the same table. The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available. The group was invited to apply for training places and also to extend that invitation out to people and into organisations and groups who hadn’t turned up, but which might nonetheless be interested.

This is a rare thing in Peterborough: a ward hustings. As far as I am aware Park Ward is the only ward in the unitary authority of Peterborough which holds a regular hustings events. Here, voters are invited, either by the residents’ associations or by whoever leaflets the ward. Park Ward has begun to view them as an important part of the run up to election day. I am a big fan of hustings, as a glimpse at my blog will confirm. I’d like to see several in every ward, since they give people chances to thrash out where candidates stand on different issues, and how they perform, and what they are like.\nAnyway every candidate appearing on the ballot paper in May had been invited to the Church Hall by a local residents’ association and the turnout was small, but respectable and well informed. John Peach, CON, was the last candidate to arrive. I would probably have been taking my seat and organising bits of paper when there was the very slightest flutter of excitement in the audience. The hustings proceeded without incident.\nOne of the most true and telling observations of the 2015 election campaign was made by a man at the back of the audience. He pointed out that climate change had disappeared from all the parties’ election campaigns.\nAfter the event someone else came up to me and asked me to accompany him into the car park to see how John Peach had parked his car. He claimed to have felt an impact, but I am pretty sure his tongue was in his cheek and I have to say the wall did not move for me. But naturally I had a look. And of course I took a photo.\nI couldn’t see the wall behind the rear bumper at all. Can you?\nI realised that had there been the sort of penetrative event you see in a crazy American road movie, instead of talking to a man in a car park, I might have seen a man flying across my field of vision and just for a second I imagined him fly, hanging on to his church hall chair as a massive black car skidded across the parquet floor in a hail of bricks and plaster dust. But that was just me imagining something which certainly did not happen that evening. Thank goodness.\nWhat I did observe is that Cllr John Peach, (who was reelected and has since been crowned Mayor of our fair city) had proved himself capable of parking his car next to a wall in such a way that there is not a single millimetre between the car and the bricks. Not a single one.\nI blog this now only because the antique Jaguar, the mayoral vehicle EG1 is reportedly:\nand I for one would like to know how #PossibleRightOff happened.\nAnd what it costs to keep this particular mayor in maintenance and insurance.\nPerhaps Conservative councillors could tell the voters exactly what they each spend on driving around the city in very fancy cars, and how much of that expense is funded by residents?",

It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIf I was Jessica’s mum, what would I do?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nDemo for Andy Coles’ Resignation, Peterborough – Campaign …campaignopposingpolicesurveillance.com/event/demo-andy–coles…\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well.

I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\n- Jessica’s statement at the Police Spies Out of Lives and the PSOOL blog, 12 May 2017.\n- Paul Gravett, Andy Davey, the quiet spycop turned tory councillor an deputy police and crime commissioner, ARspycatcher, 12 May 2017.\n- Rob Evans, Cambridgeshire deputy police commissioner facing calls to resign over spy allegations, Guardian, 12 May 2017.\n- Simon Isreal, Police official under pressure to quit, Channel4 News, 12 May 2017.\nA biography is provided here: http://powerbase.info/index.php/Andy_Coles\nWhere the Met stands: re: previous similar but proved cases\nAll councillors inclined to agree with keeping Coles on their body should read this:\nhttp://news.met.police.uk/news/claimants-in-civil-cases-receive-mps-apology-138574\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved.

The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_transition/content_115.html": "RAMSEY FOODBANK SHOWS ME WHAT IT DOES\nLast week I visited Cambridgeshire’s newest foodbank, which opened a year ago in Ramsey. This visit formed one of a number of visits to the region’s growing number of food banks by members of the European Green Team in the run up to the European elections on 22nd May. Our team has reported on Hunger in the East.\nThe Ramsey foodbank is based at St Thomas a Becket on Ramsey High Street and it works as part of the network of Trussell Trust foodbanks which now serve no fewer than fourteen communities throughout Cambridgeshire.\n“I arrived with me lots of grand ideas and optimism. Less than a week before my visit I had been at the opening of a new food cooperative in Peterborough which has huge ambitions to change the way we shop and eat in the city. I am talking to growers and makers and I am often around people who jar and pot things.\n“When I arrived in Ramsey the market town sitting in an area of rich arable land was particularly green and beautiful, and lush with recent rain. The harsh realities of hunger in an area which is so very rich agriculturally brought me down to earth and made me think.”\nWHY EMPTY KITCHEN CUPBOARDS IN RAMSEY?\nRev’d Gita Bond, who manages the Ramsey project explained that “The foodbank provides an emergency food supply for people without an income or on an income so low that they cannot afford food. Its clientele is identified by one of a dozen different agencies as in need of emergency food. They are issued with a voucher.”\nThe food bank relies on ongoing donations from parishioners and residents and it is also on the lookout for people who can deliver donations to people who are not mobile or who live further away.\nGita didn’t need to explain about the tea and biscuit which awaits volunteers: a group of people were talking and organising all manner of things around a busy and welcoming table. The church works with a wide range of community groups and there is a warm welcome for everybody.\nFoodbanks have proliferated because successive governments have failed and failed and failed again to tackle poverty wages.\nThe costs of living rise and people in work find their pay stands still and it is impossible to pay all the bills and put food on the table. People earning poverty pay are a growing part of those turning to food banks for help.\nPeople not in work for various reasons are more obviously vulnerable to hunger. But they are also victims of ideologically motivated and regressive government decisions.\nThe Green Party disapproves very strongly of the Department of Work and Pensions’ “sanctions” regime, which literally removes the welfare safety net from vulnerable claimants. Although a sanction can later be removed, a hunger gap opens up immediately. If the person falling into that hunger gap is lucky, they might get help from the foodbank.\n“Worries have recently been expressed to me that employees in the DWP may be being prevented by their line managers from identifying and referring people who need food immediately.”\n“We need an immediate change in government policy. Policy has gone back to before the second world war: we had malnutrition then and it is shameful that it has come back.\n“And on the ground, regardless of who gets elected on 22nd May, we need to figure out how we can improve our food resilience.\n“I was both impressed and horrified. I could see that almost all the food in the store is processed and packaged and it needs to be like that in order to have a reasonably long shelf life. Consequently there is nothing fresh at all. If someone donates something with a source of protein in it, such as a tin of fish or meatballs it can be issued. But if what is received is nutritionally unbalanced or poor, or all if all the donations are pasta, then that is all the foodbank can issue.\n“I suspect that what happens is that someone steps in: I bet it is someone with very limited means themselves, but it will be someone who cares. Communities work like this: but it is awful that they have to. But I am so very impressed with what they do manage to achieve despite the problems.\n“What I simply don’t understand is why we accept this system. Isn’t it insane for a country as wealthy as ours to function in this miserable way?\nCALL TO RETAIL CHAINS TO HELP\nThe Green Party is urging retail chains with outlets in the Ramsey area to make small regular donations of suitable items. A list is available from the foodbank.\n“But beyond these immediate calls for help, we are urging food processors to identify and minimise food waste. I sometimes hear about large amounts of perfectly edible food being dumped in Cambridgeshire: some of it destined for landfill (because it has been packaged and it is not worth unpacking it). Some of it goes for composting. In fact I heard a little while ago that on a farm close to Ramsey supermarket reject tomatoes were being composted. They might be the wrong colour or shape. This is not sustainable: this is not right.\n“It is high time we got this edible fresh food quickly to people who want and need good quality local food. I am perfectly happy to go and talk to a producer or a shop myself about what goes wrong in our broken food systems and how we can work to tackle hunger. I think the co-existence of food waste and hunger demonstrates that the food economy is not working efficiently. This is not good for consumers, but it doesn’t do any good to local farmers or food producers either.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2016_04_19_peterboroughs-nappy-app/content_574.html": "Yesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.\nThis is very inspiring. I’m just about to start delivering my election leaflets in Orton Waterville ward. The weather is looking good today, but it can change very quickly in this part of Peterborough (and back again, thankfully). I’m in no danger of smashing your PB, but if I can get through it without major injury to fingers, knees or feet (and lose some more weight, which has been happening consistently since I joined Peterborough Green Party) I shall be satisfied.\nLikeLike",

The workshop explained how an “asset of community value” can be registered with the local council and what that means should it be or become threatened. The rules were explained and what and what was not eligible.\nThe new group is not a “political” group in that peoples’ views on the legislation may be strong, but those views are not the point. I would describe this as a “technical” alliance between people prepared to share knowledge and help people in Peterborough who want to do this. I was quite shocked to learn that Peterborough has only registered two Assets of Community Value (the Green Backyard and the Football Ground) whereas Chelmsford identified seventy which needed to be registered.\nWhat about the Lido? We need a little list.\nCllr Andy Coles acted as spokesperson for the Peterborough group at the workshop and he was an obvious elected councillor lead. For those who don’t know him he is a keen supporter of The Green Backyard and used to be its beekeeper. He has also supported the parishing of Westwood (a project currently in abeyance, but which I strongly support) and he currently holds the council’s “community” brief.\nAlun Williams volunteered to look after the membership.\nYou can join the new group on face book.

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_01_05_henry-penn-walk-collapse-update/content_567.html": "Neglect of City Centre River Walk on North Embankment of River Nene\nPhotos of the sorry state of collapsed Henry Penn Walk have been posted on Facebook by We Love Peterborough.\nI documented the state of the path in August 2021. You can compare WLP’s recent photo here with mine:\nBut the problem pre dated my first blog on the subject by a long way. There is a closed report on the council’s website, dated 20th October 2020.\nSince I wrote that blog, I’ve been told that the reason nothing has been done to repair the broken path is that Peterborough City Council, (possibly Environment Agency) and one or more developers can’t agree on who owns the path and also that it was built out over the river without planning or any other kind of permission (I’m not sure what the procedure is for building out into a river). As ever I’m happy to be corrected if I have been misinformed this latter point. A slightly different story appeared almost a year ago, when a swift end to the legal tangle, (but apparently not involving the EA) was expected. It suggests that the council agrees it owns the surface of the path. But not its foundations. (Could that happen and if so, how could it have arisen?)\nA legal battle may make it awkward for the parties to it to speak to the press. But two of those parties are funded by the tax payer and the tax payer should be told why a solution and suitable repair could not precede settlement of the case. The costs could be recouped – if necessary – by means of a legal charge on the property. If the path is a property which was built by means of illegal invasion of the river, which seems a bit unlikely, what is the remedy in law? Does an illegal property exist or is it a bit like Schrödinger’s cat? Can a property which should not even be there be compulsorily purchased or confiscated? Can it even have an owner? Could a proper repair cost more than the value of a shoddy property (I’d bet it could). I think we should be told.\nMost unfortunately the council has set an awful precedent in Park Ward, where a drain it was given by Peterborough Development Corporation was built out into by a neighbouring property owner and a hideous building was given retrospective planning permission. So the council has established a flabby attitude to allowing people to develop beyond their own boundaries and into its watery properties (not something I condone or recommend).\nBut even if the story I was told holds water, it should be possible to find out who built a path on the bank capable of being washed away. While the flats were under construction, the whole site was fenced off, so the general public would not have been able to see anything. Is the organisation which built a soluble embankment still in business?\nIt should be possible to establish the position of the river bank before and after the flats were built. It should be possible to find out how many building regulations checks were performed as the flats were built and whether or not the rogue path was spotted or anything done about it during the flats’ construction. This is something the council’s planning department should be able to establish. I don’t have photographs. But someone must have some.\nI’ve been assured that no danger is posed to the buildings, but even if this is true, it is not the impression given by the landscaping: the dodgy path appears to have been held up by a steel retaining wall which has very definitely failed. It isn’t clear to the casual passer by (even if it is to the council’s structural engineering expert) what is holding the flats up. If the council’s building inspectors missed a dodgy retaining wall, can we be sure that they checked the one which may or may not be behind the dodgy one and which may or not be holding the embankment under the flats in place?\nThe path poses obvious hazards to pedestrians and cyclists and has, rightly, been closed. However repairs to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, even in Central Ward in Peterborough does not carry the priority it would if the route happened to carry cars. This despite the fact that the path is on the tourist trail. Peterborough remains a car crazy city and unattractive damage to the north bank river path persists apparently unnoticed by the city’s elected members. Voters should note that Cllr Jamil’s current term of office ends in May.\n<\ndiv dir=”ltr”>This is something th\nLikeLike\nHi June I don’t understand your comment.

I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nJulie Howell, the Green Party’s mayoral candidate for the Combined Authority of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (which includes Huntingdonshire) went to the Treasury in the snow to protest the underfunding of Peterborough.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.",

And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nThe Cambridge News published some of what I said along with a photo .\nPeterborough Telegraph believes the financial burden will fall upon the tenants of the block. I believe that this would be profoundly wrong and I will set out why in this second update.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nthat the approved planning application according to which the block was to be constructed is 96/00001/FUL | Validated: Mon 07 Oct 1996 | Status: Decided\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nBehind the sheeting is sand. Here is similar material taken from a picture about a road being built on the construction company’s Facebook page. This may or may not be what is behind the steel sheeting too.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.\nOne thought on “Henry Penn Walk collapse a second update”",

Tickets are free, but places are limited!\nPlease make sure of your place by booking here!\nThe event offers attendees a chance to share their views openly on a number of topics, which will be chosen by participants at the event. We hope to pursue the theme of a sustainable and green city and our objective is to facilitate and engage in ongoing dialogue with the City Council.\nWrong side of the road in Peterborough\nThe previous cycle route ran to the RIGHT of the vehicular one. (It was one of two city centre roads which require moving to the wrong side of the roads and was a top local knowledge quiz question.) It was used by cyclists to EXIT Long Causeway onto Broadway. During recent new surfacing work, inexplicably the old route has been blocked off by a new bit of fence.\nLong Causeway is one way for vehicles but two way for cyclists.\nNo entry signs at the EXIT of Long Causeway don’t make sense, even to car drivers, who wouldn’t see them, if they were driving in the right direction. The road is one way for cars, (isn’t it?) which would be coming towards you in this picture. The only vehicular exit is via Cathedral Square. Which is behind you.\nOnly council permitted vehicles are allowed in past the rising bollards. Although they are not currently working, it looks as if a new monitor has been installed.\nAn exit is required onto Broadway for cyclists. At the moment cyclists are cycling straight past the completely pointless no entry sign and over the potentially rising bollards.\nIs the council planning to\n- reinstate the previous cycle route and remove the fence? This would separate cars from bikes and leave a favourite quiz question intact.\n- remove the no entry signs?\n- add a cycling contraflow sign (as at the roundabout end of Cowgate)? But if it is going to do this will it explain how it intends to ensure cyclists aren’t accidentally impaled on a rising bollard they haven’t noticed?\nWe did have a Council Leader who wanted to abolish cycling in the whole city centre. He lost his seat in May.\nWhile he is gone, I for one am hoping the Council will be able to resolve this particular road sign nonsense quickly, sensibly and constructively. And if whoever is responsible for traffic signs in the city wants to comment below, he or she is very welcome.\nThere is hope. The view in the other direction makes a little bit more sense, (except for the temporary signage).\nPeterborough Green Festival 2015\nPeterborough in Transition is here: PinT\nPeterborough in Transition\ntwitter: www.twitter.com/TransitionPboro\nwebsite: www.peterboroughintransition.org.uk\nfacebook: www.facebook.com/transitionpeterborough\nNCT Nearly New SALE on Wednesday 25th March\nMy MP emailed me and he said:\nThank you for contacting me about fracking, I understand your concerns with this matter and appreciate your correspondence.\nShale gas is a promising new potential energy resource which could reduce our reliance on imported gas and help with keeping energy costs low. It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough\nI emailed my MP and I said:\nI am writing to ask you to vote against the Government’s changes to the Infrastructure Bill on fracking that remove any guarantee that drinking water sources will be protected from fracking, and to call for an immediate fracking moratorium.\nThe changes made in the House of Lords weaken several of the 13 conditions accepted by Government in the House of Commons, including vital provisions to protect drinking water from fracking.\nPlease vote to ensure fracking is banned in all ground water source protection zones 1 – 3.\nAlthough these protections would make fracking safer, they cannot make it safe because fracking is inherently risky, and would exacerbate climate change.\nI am therefore asking that you call for an immediate fracking moratorium in the House of Commons. While the UK Government attempts to weaken the few protections we have, the rest of Britain is taking measures to protect the health of communities and the climate.\nI urge you call on Government to follow the lead of Wales and Scotland by bringing forward an immediate fracking moratorium so that the risks to health and climate change can be fully investigated.\nThe sooner we follow in the footsteps of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, New York State, Denton (Texas) – and the rest of Britain – by stopping fracking, the better for our communities, the climate and our local environment.\nYours Sincerely,\nFiona Radic\nThe hidden history of wind power in Peterborough\nI am convinced that the design of wind turbines is still in its infancy. Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2024_04_18_bye-bye-box/content_82.html": "I walked through Central Park recently and realised that nearly every single box had died. I took a couple of photos intending to write to the council and promptly forgot.\nThen, thanks to Angus Ellis I received a useful reminder. Thank you, Angus.\nThe reminder arrived in the form of a Labour and Co-operative Party leaflet suggesting I vote for Angus who is this party’s candidate in Park Ward. It dropped on my doormat and I eventually got round to reading it. I discovered a very rare picture of Park Ward Councillor Mohammed Samir (who, along with another Ravensthorpe councillor is not profligate with his words or his image) at the bottom right of page three. And even more surprising, there, in front of his frown and rising up the bank behind him is scorched, brown and dead or dying box hedging, telling every sharp eyed reader in Park Ward the very sad story about its own highly likely extinction.\nWeather conditions are increasingly brutal and this pattern of intemperate weather (part of our new, not so temperate climate) is particularly cruel to box, a key evergreen parks and gardens hedging plant. Long periods of extreme drought alternating with non stop record rainfall will have stressed this along with many other plants, including many of Central Park’s trees.\nSlowly, since 2007 when it was first recorded in the UK, the box moth has been travelling north (it began its very long journey somewhere in South East Asia!) and here it is: rampaging across Peterborough. It noticed it in my garden only last summer. It probably reached the park before that.\nI wrote to the council this morning to ask that the dead box bushes are dug out. A very sad job for those who tended them. It used to be good gardening practice to burn diseased and infested plants. These days, hot composting (we have brown garden bins for that in Peterborough) will probably do the job of disinfection.\nI have also been thinking about what needs doing in Central Park to deal with the loss of the lovely robust evergreen structure which the box has provided for many years around Central Park’s beds and along paths. Evergreens are particularly important in winter, when so many plants are bare.\nReplacement structural evergreen hedging can’t be planted safely in Spring or Summer (October is the very earliest sensible time) and until then at the earliest, removing dead plants will open the beds up to unwanted foot traffic: both pet and human.\nFast growing decorative annual flowers might have time to provide protective ground cover until a decision is made on whether and how to replace.\nI would be very surprised if there is one plant which could do what the extraordinary and now at risk box did for all the park’s flower beds, since the conditions in each bed are increasingly varied: some are very very dry (memorial gardens) and others around the outer path are shady and one or two occasionally waterlogged. Decisions could be complicated.\nSeeding with forget-me-not (on damper beds) and/or nasturtium (round the top of the dry memorial garden).\nAnd if a decision is made to retain hedge type edging, which plants might work well in the various conditions to be found in different beds around the park?\nI think that rosemary might work around the memorial garden. It doesn’t mind neglect and drought and responds to drought by flowering (all year round!!) if dry. It doesn’t mind being on a bank which will lose rainwater. It can be clipped (min twice a year) into a very beautiful and sturdy box type hedge. But it probably shouldn’t go in straight away: there will be too much box moth around and it’s definitely a second choice target!",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_enviroment-capital/content_590.html": "On Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf",

And tomorrow (assuming it is signed tomorrow)?\nHave you checked whether or not the council considered options other than incineration? What evidence of careful consideration of other options are you relying on? Are you aware that the council has been consistently challenged on this since 2007, (and possibly earlier)?\nAre you aware that the business cases for incineration in general and for this particular incinerator are both now being challenged as unsafe (the economy and the market having changed substantially)? Have you considered the financial impact on council tax payers should these cautions turn out to be well founded? And that if the business performs as badly as expected are you aware of the likely impact on recycling, too?\nHas the contract been set up in such a way that it can attract structural or grant funding? Or has it been set up in such a way that it is ineligible?\nAre you aware of the total cost of this contract? Figures of £76M and £80M have been quoted recently in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph for the capital costs alone. Is that figure current? What are the overall 30 year costs for this project? Is it acceptable that this information is still not in the public domain? Is it acceptable that innocent readers of their local paper might assume that this figure is the total cost of the project?\nAre you aware that the council is deliberately choosing out of date technology and describing it as “tried and tested”? (the information on technology is still not in the public domain).\nAre you aware that the council might be comparing the energy recovery of its own plant with Scandinavian examples? If so are you aware that in Scandinavia (which is used to colder weather and historically much more aware of the importance of insulation and energy security) high performance hot water supply grids are planned in (eg for swimming pools or district heating). Peterborough has not planned a supply grid and has not explained who will buy energy and power generated by this incinerator. Have you seen an example of the output and recovery figures from either Peterborough’s as planned and have you compared that with an operational equivalent in Scandinavia and an operational equivalent in the UK (local campaigners are finding that those in the UK can’t sell their power).\nAre you aware that the UK’s statutory regulatory regime for air pollution (in which the council has placed its trust) is widely regarded as unfit for purpose? The Health Protection Agency is about to undertake research into whether or not it can substantiate the assurances and claims it has been making and upon which the Environment Agency and numerous councils have historically relied. Is the council aware of the potential damage it could do to its own Environment Capital “aspiration” if, as widely expected, it can’t?\nDo you know enough about air pollution and monitoring in the city? Does Peterborough monitor anything other than road traffic? Where are the monitoring stations and are they in the right places? What regime is planned for when the incinerator is operational?\nHave you considered the social, health and cost impacts on the city of a mass burn incinerator in an area with very high (and rising) levels of social deprivation?\nAre you aware that a new incinerator on an industrial site in Fletton is operating and is apparently making people ill, but that the council has not done anything about it, and that not one person amongst the “officers’ panel” and members present at the Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee Call in Meeting on 29th August was equipped to advise the ward councillor who asked about this problem in his ward? I understand that the ward councillor had been told by the Environment Agency that it was a matter for the council. As a member of the public I witnessed that not a single person actually knew how to deal with this relatively small problem – nobody offered to look into it or explain who the ward councillor should talk to, if it wasn’t the Environment Agency. This is despite the presence of senior council officers and (at least) three lawyers.\nAre you satisfied with the monitoring and regulation of pollution in the city?\nPlease can Richard Olive have answers to the questions which Peterborough Friends of the Earth has asked the council on this matter?\nCan you write NONE against – or otherwise provide detail of any personal, family or party interest you have had, have or are likely to have – in any of the following:\n- the council’s Energy Services Company?\n- “Blue Sky”?\n- this sector?\n- this decision?\nI look forward to hearing from you, etc.\nCo-minglers might have to prove quality of result\nA number of local authorities, including Peterborough co-mingle recyclables in a single collection.\nOther authorities collect each recyclable item separately.\nIn 2008 this was demonstrated to be better value, since the end product is more likely to fetch a good price.\nThe Campaign for Real Recycling is challenging the asssumption so far made:\nthat co-mingled collections of paper, metal, plastics and glass produces a quality result.\nhttp://www.realrecycling.org.uk/news/news39.php\nA judicial review hearing will be held in Cardiff, starting on 14th December 2011.\nPeterborough for Responsible Waste Management fights for good quality recycling.",

It thus becoming the substantive motion and the only item which could be voted on. This removed any opportunity to discuss the original motion. It also positioned the council as unhappy, but wishing to remain in the conversation. At least one councillor believes that the city would have been excluded from discussions on the “proposed East Anglia Devolution Agreement” #ToryDevolution #EasternPowerhouse or what I think it is: #PseudoDevolution had it voted FOR the Ferris Motion.\nThe council published this, but only on Twitter at 7.15pm last night (the meeting began at 7pm).

Or who drive electric, hybrid and low emissions vehicles. The importance of leadership cannot be overstated.\n- We could vote in councillors who understand that a 20mph speed limit in Peterborough’s residential streets would make cycling and walking pleasanter and would reduce the number of journeys taken by car.\n- We could find a real time air pollution app which relies on independent air monitoring and which works in Peterborough, so that we are not obliged to rely solely on council owned data.\n- The council could live stream its incinerator emissions and on street air pollution monitoring data on its website. If it is proud of what it is doing, there should be no qualms in showing off its achievements.\nHow I wonder how you park?\nOn the 21st April 2015 a hustings was held in All Saints Church Hall, Park Road Peterborough. This is a rare thing in Peterborough: a ward hustings. As far as I am aware Park Ward is the only ward in the unitary authority of Peterborough which holds a regular hustings events. Here, voters are invited, either by the residents’ associations or by whoever leaflets the ward. Park Ward has begun to view them as an important part of the run up to election day. I am a big fan of hustings, as a glimpse at my blog will confirm. I’d like to see several in every ward, since they give people chances to thrash out where candidates stand on different issues, and how they perform, and what they are like.\nAnyway every candidate appearing on the ballot paper in May had been invited to the Church Hall by a local residents’ association and the turnout was small, but respectable and well informed. John Peach, CON, was the last candidate to arrive. I would probably have been taking my seat and organising bits of paper when there was the very slightest flutter of excitement in the audience. The hustings proceeded without incident.\nOne of the most true and telling observations of the 2015 election campaign was made by a man at the back of the audience. He pointed out that climate change had disappeared from all the parties’ election campaigns.\nAfter the event someone else came up to me and asked me to accompany him into the car park to see how John Peach had parked his car. He claimed to have felt an impact, but I am pretty sure his tongue was in his cheek and I have to say the wall did not move for me. But naturally I had a look. And of course I took a photo.\nI couldn’t see the wall behind the rear bumper at all. Can you?\nI realised that had there been the sort of penetrative event you see in a crazy American road movie, instead of talking to a man in a car park, I might have seen a man flying across my field of vision and just for a second I imagined him fly, hanging on to his church hall chair as a massive black car skidded across the parquet floor in a hail of bricks and plaster dust. But that was just me imagining something which certainly did not happen that evening. Thank goodness.\nWhat I did observe is that Cllr John Peach, (who was reelected and has since been crowned Mayor of our fair city) had proved himself capable of parking his car next to a wall in such a way that there is not a single millimetre between the car and the bricks. Not a single one.\nI blog this now only because the antique Jaguar, the mayoral vehicle EG1 is reportedly:\nand I for one would like to know how #PossibleRightOff happened.\nAnd what it costs to keep this particular mayor in maintenance and insurance.\nPerhaps Conservative councillors could tell the voters exactly what they each spend on driving around the city in very fancy cars, and how much of that expense is funded by residents?\nWrong side of the road in Peterborough\nThe previous cycle route ran to the RIGHT of the vehicular one. (It was one of two city centre roads which require moving to the wrong side of the roads and was a top local knowledge quiz question.) It was used by cyclists to EXIT Long Causeway onto Broadway. During recent new surfacing work, inexplicably the old route has been blocked off by a new bit of fence.\nLong Causeway is one way for vehicles but two way for cyclists.\nNo entry signs at the EXIT of Long Causeway don’t make sense, even to car drivers, who wouldn’t see them, if they were driving in the right direction. The road is one way for cars, (isn’t it?) which would be coming towards you in this picture. The only vehicular exit is via Cathedral Square. Which is behind you.\nOnly council permitted vehicles are allowed in past the rising bollards. Although they are not currently working, it looks as if a new monitor has been installed.\nAn exit is required onto Broadway for cyclists. At the moment cyclists are cycling straight past the completely pointless no entry sign and over the potentially rising bollards.\nIs the council planning to\n- reinstate the previous cycle route and remove the fence? This would separate cars from bikes and leave a favourite quiz question intact.\n- remove the no entry signs?\n- add a cycling contraflow sign (as at the roundabout end of Cowgate)? But if it is going to do this will it explain how it intends to ensure cyclists aren’t accidentally impaled on a rising bollard they haven’t noticed?\nWe did have a Council Leader who wanted to abolish cycling in the whole city centre. He lost his seat in May.\nWhile he is gone, I for one am hoping the Council will be able to resolve this particular road sign nonsense quickly, sensibly and constructively. And if whoever is responsible for traffic signs in the city wants to comment below, he or she is very welcome.\nThere is hope. The view in the other direction makes a little bit more sense, (except for the temporary signage).\nPeterborough hustings venues\nThis is a list of publicly owned (that means we the public own them) venues which are made available by statute free of charge by the city council for people to hold hustings in. Venues for Hustings – for Candidates 2015\nPeterborough’s best hustings are often held in churches or schools. These can be public or closed events. Hustings they can be held anywhere and by any organisation. A school event is particularly interesting: because children often see politics as something which only happens on the television or on the radio. You are never too young to vote. You are never too young to debate a issue.\nThe person hosting the hustings will probably need a candidate to apply for one of these venues. The legislation (statute) governing this provision is the Representation of the People Act.\nThis hustings will happen later this week and there are rules (below the picture) about how to ask a question. The organisation of the hustings is up to the host.\nClick here for further details about the St Johns hustings\nI have never attended a hustings which got out of hand (close, but the well behaved sixth formers and their teachers worked hard to persuade candidates perhaps not to resort to fisticuffs). A calm, friendly and firm person in the chair will help ensure a hustings keeps its hair on. However the history of violence and intimidation within and working against the British democratic process is substantial and centuries old. This is well understood by parliament itself. So to help keep things peaceful and calm, legislation makes a police presence available to hustings organisers if they feel they need one. A very important, but perhaps not well understood statutory duty of the police is to uphold the democratic process, of which the hustings form a very important important part.\ntwinkle twinkle polished car\nYou see, our Park Ward councillor team (two Labour, one Conservative) went for what they describe as “aggressive pavement cyclists” recently and tasked the police with talking to shocked children and middle aged women cycling along gently as well as people who couldn’t speak English. (My sample was tiny: but I did one.) They fined about a third of the people they stopped: most of them probably incapable of being polite and apologising nicely to a policeman. (Some offenders just got warned, although whether or not cycling on a pavement is an offence in all circumstances is a moot point.) So I think it only fair to point out that cycling on the pavement can be a perfectly logical and reasonable response to dangerous junctions, roads and cycle lanes and is a better place to cycle if your lights have just packed up.\nCars which park in the Park Road cycle lane, or across it or on the pavement are a regular feature of life at this end of Park Road and I for one don’t think it is safe. I think badly behaved drivers are one of a number of contributory factors encouraging “pavement cycling”.\nI didn’t paint in the double yellow lines (which most people don’t even believe are there any more: they are virtually worn out). The Conservative council did. So I think elected Conservative members of all people should be able to show us how we can all live happily with their decisions.\nWill anybody in Peterborough see tomorrow’s solar eclipse?\nFor a second day running it has not been possible to see the sun in Peterborough at 09:30. I had made a note to check where it would be on Friday (tomorrow) when there is a chance to witness a near total solar eclipse. People have made plans and some have plotted parties and bought cameras, filters, projectors and protective eye wear, ready for the big day.\nInstead we have “fog”. This is a polite word for particulate laden and polluted air. It might be a lot more accurate to call it “smog”. Yesterday it almost lifted just after lunch and shafts of sunlight penetrated into the city centre. Today we have what looks like heavy cloud. But it is more likely that the smog has simply floated up a bit. The government website is predicting worse pollution levels on Friday than today.\nI joined the Green Party in 2007 as I tried to reverse Peterborough City Council’s decision to support the incineration of domestic waste. This was a battle which we campaigners lost. We saw a neighbouring proposal fall in the face of a far more successful campaign. Lessons were learned, as they say. And I started to consider the vexed question of what exactly drives politics in Peterborough.\nA key supporter of incineration of waste is Cllr Marco Cereste (he is also a director of Peterborough Renewable Energy Limited which builds slightly cleaner incinerators than the one the council is building). As leader of the council he personally attracts huge amounts of anger, frustration and suspicion: some of it reasonable, some of it less so. But in the last couple of weeks he has told the story of his signing (on behalf of the city he represents) a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on his facebook profile (shared with his facebook friends). This MoU is with an entity locals understand is a Chinese government funded organisation, possibly what we’d call in the UK, an “NGO” (non governmental organisation).\nThen in an online discussion elsewhere entirely about this morning’s fog, someone shared this video which I hadn’t come across previously. The story of this video’s making and removal from Chinese social media is available online. I just wish that we’d had this video at the time the council’s decision was still not made. At the notorious moment when Pam Kreling (then one of the councillors making the crucial decision about whether or not to use incineration) said words to the effect that if she couldn’t see anything emerging from a stack, then there was nothing there and there was by implication nothing which could do anyone any harm. As campaigners we weren’t allowed to speak at critical moments in meetings: in fact the chair of one of the meetings offered to have me and Richard Olive thrown out when we stood up to tell them they were being hopelessly misinformed by their advisors. But as I observed this pantomime (there was no beadle to implement the Chair’s desire) I was left reeling from a deeper revelation. I still wonder how people in key positions got through even basic level schooling, what exactly went on in their science lessons and what their marks were.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_04_13_address-to-voters/content_459.html": "I am standing in Park Ward in the Peterborough City Council election on 4th May 2023.\nI am campaigning in Park, where I live and am working closely with residents on the things we all care about. If your voice is not getting through to the council or to the police, for example, I can help.\nLitter\nAs we walk around the ward we spot lidless bins. As we come across these, each one is being reported to the council. Park Ward is awash with litter, a lot being blown out of broken bins by gusts of wind.\nCommunity Centres\nPark Ward has no council owned community centres. All Saints Church Hall and Central Park’s Bowls Pavilion can be hired for community events. But with the Elm Tree Tavern site subject to a planning application, there is now only one pub (The Hand & Heart) left in our ward. Although we have an unusually high number of school and college buildings, these aren’t routinely open for community use during holidays and at weekends. (Teachers are already overloaded.) We are short of venues and many young people are at a loss for something to do outside school. During a phase of rapid development, the city currently risks losing our Regional Pool and Athletics Track. Park Ward alone has lost six tennis courts. Voluntary organisations are picking up some of the slack. But if you’d like to help with this issue, I’d love to hear from you.\nAdult Education\nAdult education and training have been cut and cut again by the government. This has reduced availability of social activities and routes to vocational training for over 18s. In our part of Peterborough, many adults struggle with English and Maths. The erosion of adult education provision damages us all, economically and in terms of quality of life.\nCare and Health\nI have worked with effective campaign teams to achieve good outcomes. I have served on Peterborough’s Maternity Services Liaison Committee which ensures that recent mothers have a way to ensure that the health services provided to pregnant and birthing mums are at the level of quality they expect and deserve. I have campaigned to protect Home Birth services and those who support mothers wishing to give birth at home. I have advocated for hospital patients who need help putting their case. And I have investigated children’s care complaints.\nHelp to Heal\nThe oppressive regime of austerity has never been lifted. We were told it would last just five years. It is time to repair and heal the damage.\nInadequate Resources\nPark Ward is not just missing out due to council cuts. Our ward doesn’t have enough councillors. We have what is known as a “democratic deficit”, not envisaged when Peterborough decided to become a unitary authority. In the ward, there is so much needs doing. With just three councillors and one MP Park is disastrously underserved in terms of elected officials. This is inevitably hard on those who get elected. My impression is that this is not really understood by the council. Our ward councillors find themselves at a disadvantage to those representing wards which do have a parish council. I would be very happy to articulate this to the council and also to residents.\nParish Peterborough\nOther areas have a set of parish councillors plus a set of town councillors plus a set of district councillors and one MP. Elect me and I will help to correct this imbalance. A vote for me IS a vote to parish Peterborough. For Park Ward, parishing would mean about a dozen new unpaid councillors – maybe more since representation is based on population. For Park Ward parishing would mean a parish council budget not otherwise available (this is an unseen deprivation). A really effective parish council takes time to develop but can do a lot. A parish council costs each council tax payer a few pounds on their annual bill, but the PC can decide at what level to set it. In several parishes in the city, we can all see on social media how this additional budget a parish can be used to provide free bulky waste collections, which save those who need it huge bulky waste bills. A “parish nurse” is another option, which looks more attractive the more fractured the NHS becomes. I’d love to hear from you hear if these ideas appeal to you.\nDentistry\nDentistry is an essential NHS service but it almost entirely collapsed during the pandemic. It is still in crisis, with no lists at all open at present for NHS patients to register in Peterborough. Dental surgeries are in limbo, waiting for new contracts. We must force central government to rethink its approach to the National Health Service. Voting Green at local level is the single best way to do this, since The Green Party is unambiguously opposed to privatisation of health services.\nSafer Roads\nI have consistently supported reducing the speed limit to 20mph on residential roads. Most traffic already travels slowly, as road conditions demand. But a lower legal limit would improve safety and the quality of life of residents and everyone travelling to and from colleges, schools and nurseries in Park ward. I will work with existing and new projects to make active travel safer and easier, prioritising more vulnerable road users to make the roads more useable for them. Feeling good and being safe when out and about is so important for health.\nA Greener Street Scene\nOur pavements have been neglected and our street scene is not as attractive or as welcoming as it used to be and could be again. Park Ward has lost street trees and gained private cars, as people struggle to get around without a car. This gives us parking and congestion problems. Park ward needs better and more buses. And we need a lot of good gardeners. Please contact me if you can help.\nBetter Building\nPlanning legislation is inadequate and developers have been able to build in a way which degrades our built environment. Developments without supporting infrastructure, creating large residential areas without schools, transport links, community hubs or surgeries have gone up. The council has not had enough powers or resources to prevent inadequate and unsympathetic developments, despite its very excellent Local Plan, drawn up a few years ago with a very decent consultative process. At a time when climate change requires homes to be improved, the UK has pretty much binned its housing standards, and those which remain are not built to. I would be delighted to work with the council to help it perform as well as possible on planning.\nDrainage\nPark Ward is mostly flat and therefore vulnerable to blocked drains and to the ever increasing risk of flash floods. In Park ward, homes have been subjected to the wholly unacceptable ingress of passing vehicles’ wash during recent flash flood events. The traffic wasn’t even stopped. This showed how much we need to tackle drainage. Park ward is lucky because we have precious green spaces which can be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change. The council has an entire section on its website featuring Sustainable Drainage (SUDS) I’d like to help the council dig this policy out and implement it. Roads we know can flood in Park ward should be tackled first.\nAsset Management\nThe city’s antiquated combined sewage and rainwater drains needs replacement or overhaul. I discovered that the handover of the old Drainage Board’s property infrastructure to the Council was never completed when the Development Corporation left. This is one of Peterborough’s very many asset management issues, which all need sorting out. Another is Peterborough’s Green Wheel, which (at about the same time) was never given the legacy funding needed for its maintenance. The council needs to go to battle with Westminster to get proper funding for these necessary but yet unfunded things. It is time national government treated Peterborough with due respect.\nAchievements\nI stood for parliament in 2010 and 2017. I helped manage the successful Green Mayor Campaign in which The Green Party kept its deposit, polling over 9% of first preference votes in Peterborough and proved strong core support in a city with strong environmental ambition. I was part of the team which helped Orton Waterville to elect Peterborough’s first Green city councillor and we now have a Green group of four city councillors. Vote for me. I am ready and able now to join my fellow Greens on the council to make a positive difference in Park Ward.\nOne thought on “ADDRESS TO VOTERS”",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_petition/content_537.html": "After I posted my comments on why people might be sharing the 2nd EU Referendum petition, I had a day out: trying to do something other than reflect on the nightmare of the Leave vote, which was totally impossible.\nWhile out I learned that the police or the government (depending which story you read) were investigating a possible fraud to do with the people who had signed the petition: some of whom didn’t live in the UK and some of whom were apparently surplus to the entire populations of whole countries, so presumably might consist only of an email address. 77,000 false signatures had apparently been removed. Variations on this tale are numerous but you have to go to twitter for a laugh.\nIncidentally isn’t it wonderful that a Leave petition is being so enthusiastically embraced by the Remain side? Perhaps the petitions office should have let the No Confidence in David Cameron petition get a debate? Looking back, it might have been an easier way for him to leave office and the office might not have been left in quite such an appalling mess.",

This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess. It would be ridiculous, if it weren’t also dangerous.\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding non PCC residents from using “our” Household Recycling Facility!\nHave you lobbied your councillors on your preferences? Do you have enough information to have an opinion on where new unitary authority boundaries should lie? Do you know of a Peterborough event where this reorganisation will be considered?\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding Yaxley (Huntingdonshire District Council) and Whittlesey (Fenland District Council) residents from using their nearest (surely?) but “our” Household Recycling Facility!\na good budget requires highly effective team work\nThis meeting was live-streamed here. It began at 6pm.\nThe absence of ten councillors for the budget meeting is concerning. It is a high percentage. My very best wishes to Mayor Marco Cereste who has had a major health shock, and to his family. One councillor was legally prohibited from attending, pending a court appearance, but was able to ask a question from a remote location. I am very happy to live in a country where laws are respected and those who understand how best to implement them are able to do so. Hats off to officers for working to demonstrate a never before observed (by me, at any rate) example of inclusion.\nElected representatives who ABSTAIN on a budget might be expressing frustration or unhappiness, which, however genuinely felt, are emotions of no practical use to the residents they were elected to serve. Where the budget is concerned, it is irresponsible, because a good budget requires effective team work.\nThere is a point in voting AGAINST a budget. But to vote usefully AGAINST a budget, you must have done your homework and have another “alternative” budget up your sleeve. And you must also have the support of other elected representatives, so that you can be confident that it stands a chance of being supported if presented. In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work. You could then vote AGAINST the budget presented by the administration of the government (in this case a council) with a clean conscience, because you have built a better option. When the administration’s proposed budget falls to pass, you can then present your alternative budget. This might be just what the people who elected you need you to do.\nYou can see the breakdown of votes and who said what here.\nPeterborough’s unitary government in recent years has too often featured two sides sneering at each other’s ideas and policies and individuals not listening to good alternative policies simply because they originate from outside their own hard baked ideology (a classic example was the destruction of the local 20’s Plenty campaign, achieved by kicking a worthwhile project into the long grass of a “pilot project” and then those who kicked it never brought the results of that project back to council). Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets. The independent panel seems to have helped sort this out.\nHowever there is still some bad behaviour. During council meetings, councillors are frequently talking to their electorate in the council chamber and putting themselves onto social media. Councillor Nicola Day even took a team selfie during the meeting. Some appear to struggle to put their phone down and are constantly watching their phones while on a livestream. They embarrass Peterborough and its residents. It should be possible for councillors to switch their phones off during a meeting: it is professional to do so and it is simply good manners to give your full attention to the agenda and to your colleagues in a meeting.\nThe passage of the council’s budget on Wednesday was too tight for comfort, but compared with recent years, it was a welcome moment of calm organisation. I congratulate all those who worked constructively with Councillor Mohammed Jamil, Cabinet Member for Finance & Corporate Governance, whose approach has been consultative and consensual, to contribute to it and to vote for it. Hats off especially to Councillor Dennis Jones and to Councillor Wayne Fitzgerald. Without their closing speeches, their clarity and eloquence, this might not have passed and I strongly suspect that there was no superior alternative budget waiting in the wings. Passing any kind of workable budget in this era of badly managed economic decline (Westminster has never ended the “Austerity”) is nothing short of miraculous. I had high hopes for a new Labour government, but so far it has disappointed.\nWe have yet to see what happens as the independent supervisory panel finally walks away.\nThe council had leverage at that point. It needed to act when the residential developer was ready to rent or sell.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nfor me, it was a jaw on floor moment\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\n.. the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too ..\nAt 08:15 (once the programme ends) Just elected Paul Waugh MP (of all people!) describes, (as only a highly articulate, politically savvy and most importantly an experienced journalist could) what was going on there. I recognised his description as applicable to events in Peterborough. If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nSt Johns Church is holding a General Election Hustings\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nIs a bad portrait worse than no portrait at all?\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.",

(It was one of two city centre roads which require moving to the wrong side of the roads and was a top local knowledge quiz question.) It was used by cyclists to EXIT Long Causeway onto Broadway. During recent new surfacing work, inexplicably the old route has been blocked off by a new bit of fence.\nLong Causeway is one way for vehicles but two way for cyclists.\nNo entry signs at the EXIT of Long Causeway don’t make sense, even to car drivers, who wouldn’t see them, if they were driving in the right direction. The road is one way for cars, (isn’t it?) which would be coming towards you in this picture. The only vehicular exit is via Cathedral Square. Which is behind you.\nOnly council permitted vehicles are allowed in past the rising bollards. Although they are not currently working, it looks as if a new monitor has been installed.\nAn exit is required onto Broadway for cyclists. At the moment cyclists are cycling straight past the completely pointless no entry sign and over the potentially rising bollards.\nIs the council planning to\n- reinstate the previous cycle route and remove the fence? This would separate cars from bikes and leave a favourite quiz question intact.\n- remove the no entry signs?\n- add a cycling contraflow sign (as at the roundabout end of Cowgate)? But if it is going to do this will it explain how it intends to ensure cyclists aren’t accidentally impaled on a rising bollard they haven’t noticed?\nWe did have a Council Leader who wanted to abolish cycling in the whole city centre. He lost his seat in May.\nWhile he is gone, I for one am hoping the Council will be able to resolve this particular road sign nonsense quickly, sensibly and constructively. And if whoever is responsible for traffic signs in the city wants to comment below, he or she is very welcome.\nThere is hope. The view in the other direction makes a little bit more sense, (except for the temporary signage).",

Motion from Councillor Ferris, Councillor Fower, Councillor Johnson, Councillor Knowles, Councillor Murphy, Councillor Sandford and Councillor Shaheed\nCouncil notes the announcement by the Chancellor of a devolution deal for the East in his Budget on 16 March; but regrets that the deal, in its current form, is not acceptable to this Council.\nCouncil requests that the Chief Executive write to the Secretary of State for Local Government to bring this resolution to his attention.\nThe proposed East Anglia Devolution Agreement can be found at the following link:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508115/The _East_Anglia_Devolution_Agreement_FINAL_with_signatures_and_logos.pdf\nA hard copy of the document will be available in each Group Room.”\nBut this was not debated. Instead:\nThe wishy washy “Holdich Amendment” was passed.\nYou wouldn’t pick up what happened if you just watched the BBC News at 10pm (which I did and which Cambridge City Council members may have done). And if you looked for what follows on the council’s website, you wouldn’t find it (as I write).\nThe council did publish it on its Twitter profile: ***\nCllr Holdich is now proposing an amendment to the original motion pic.twitter.com/K75VrhvGvd\n— Peterborough Council (@PeterboroughCC) April 13, 2016\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nThe ruling Conservative Party’s Holdich Amendment was discussed and voted FOR. It thus becoming the substantive motion and the only item which could be voted on. This removed any opportunity to discuss the original motion. It also positioned the council as unhappy, but wishing to remain in the conversation. At least one councillor believes that the city would have been excluded from discussions on the “proposed East Anglia Devolution Agreement” #ToryDevolution #EasternPowerhouse or what I think it is: #PseudoDevolution had it voted FOR the Ferris Motion.\nA very similar episode took place on 29th February at South Kesteven. I proposed a motion with the aim of discussing public services and privatisation. The Conservative Leader of the Council produced an ‘amended motion’ which was “delete all text and replace with…” changing the theme beyond all recognition. There followed a lot of filibustering including accusations that it was my intention to discredit Council Officers before the whole thing was thrown out in confusion.\nIt is one thing to lose a debate based on reasoned, grown up, arguments. It is quite another to be denied the opportunity to debate Council policy in the Council chamber. http://moderngov.southkesteven.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=18176\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nI feel sure that these councillors are trained in these miserably sad techniques. It is bad enough to be offered a #PseudoDevo but the council doesn’t seem to understand that central government is bullying it. And that the local administration is behaving just as badly. I found it infantile: most six year olds are more mature.\nLikeLike",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++\nMy bank holiday and a filthy fire – two days later\nOn Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf\nMy bank holiday & a filthy fire\nMy intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157. When I tried this number I was told that the Environmental Health Officer does not work out of hours and all I could do was leave a message, just asking for a phone call, which I did.\nTomorrow I will have to spend yet more time to report this to the Environmental Health Officer at the council. I think there should be somone on call to deal with environmental health issues 24 hours a day. And I think one phone call should be enough. What do you think?\nMeanwhile thank you to Blue Watch at Dogsthorpe Fire Station for helping today!\nParty Election Broadcast from Green Party\nPeterborough to host Environment Capital Conference with Professor Hugh Montgomery on 27th February\n27th February 9am – 1pm\nAt this event to be hosted by Peterborough City Council at Kingsgate Community Church in Parnwell, Professor Hugh Montgomery will present a keynote speech on climate change.

Those with any hearing difficulties at all struggled, even when listening to those around the same table. The room needs an acoustic makeover: perhaps some thick, soft hangings to absorb the echoes and resonances it seems to set up. Or a carpet? It is odd that this room, which used to be popular for dancing to local bands, is so bad for listening in.\nDespite this, conversation was animated, constructive and well informed. There were excellent conversations about “growth”, “housing” “governance” and “transport” and I was intrigued by the inventiveness of ideas about energy and developing Peterborough’s “export” potential.\nSophie gave the group a view of the span and content of the planned eight month project and listed the training which is available.

So if you have the cash and could use that to pay, then we can keep that little bit. It all tots up, you see.”\nStartled. I paid with a note and got some coins back in my hand. I made a mental note to do something about the drift away from notes and coin. She had reminded me of something I’d forgotten.\nThen this morning I tuned into Ramblings and heard the Commoners Choir sing The Coiners Song.\nIsaac Newton got a mention in the programme for having gone after the coiners in his official capacity as Master of the Royal Mint. Coiners would snip off tiny pieces from the edges of circulating coins and they’d use the shavings to forge new ones. Counterfeiting is an age old criminal offence described here on the Royal Mint’s website.\nThis morning’s Ramblings came from Calderdale, and that is where some of the coining went on. Click the link for an article about it or hunt out the novel ‘The Gallows Pole’ by Benjamin Myers or look out for the six-part series, The Gallows Pole, which is expected to air on BBC One in 2023:\nRudyard Kipling’s poem The Coiner did not get a mention in this morning’s Ramblings. Kipling has been regarded as politically incorrect for a large part of my lifetime. But he is now being read by a post imperial generation, which seems to be able to read and to appreciate his work within the contexts of his time. I wonder what he’d have said about “card charges” and how he’d have described what the banks do to our cash each time they process our card transactions? Listen here to how his song pays tribute to the huge positive social impact the coiners had! And this probably isn’t merely the stuff of fiction, because they could not possibly have committed the crimes they did without a great many people being prepared to cooperate with them.\nCould one point thirty percent help to “wreck Britain’s economy”? And even if it couldn’t, should something be done about it? Anyone got an idea? Legal, of course.\nThe card company is providing a service so will charge someone-shopper or shopkeepers. Cash transactions are fine but can also be more easily hidden from tax man, perhaps used to pay a cash in hand employee consequently with no workers rights. There are certain places that only take cash, the shopkeepers could do that, or have a minimum spend, or even pass on the cost to the customer now we’ve left the EU protection against such things! To me this charge is a cost of doing business\nLikeLike\nInteresting perspective. I agree about the legitimacy of a charge for the provision of a service. What surprises me is the level of the charge. I think it is high. The volumes must be enormous.\nLikeLike",

This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess. It would be ridiculous, if it weren’t also dangerous.\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding non PCC residents from using “our” Household Recycling Facility!\nHave you lobbied your councillors on your preferences? Do you have enough information to have an opinion on where new unitary authority boundaries should lie?

It began at 6pm.\nThe absence of ten councillors for the budget meeting is concerning. It is a high percentage. My very best wishes to Mayor Marco Cereste who has had a major health shock, and to his family. One councillor was legally prohibited from attending, pending a court appearance, but was able to ask a question from a remote location. I am very happy to live in a country where laws are respected and those who understand how best to implement them are able to do so. Hats off to officers for working to demonstrate a never before observed (by me, at any rate) example of inclusion.\nElected representatives who ABSTAIN on a budget might be expressing frustration or unhappiness, which, however genuinely felt, are emotions of no practical use to the residents they were elected to serve. Where the budget is concerned, it is irresponsible, because a good budget requires effective team work.\nThere is a point in voting AGAINST a budget. But to vote usefully AGAINST a budget, you must have done your homework and have another “alternative” budget up your sleeve. And you must also have the support of other elected representatives, so that you can be confident that it stands a chance of being supported if presented. In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work. You could then vote AGAINST the budget presented by the administration of the government (in this case a council) with a clean conscience, because you have built a better option. When the administration’s proposed budget falls to pass, you can then present your alternative budget. This might be just what the people who elected you need you to do.\nYou can see the breakdown of votes and who said what here.\nPeterborough’s unitary government in recent years has too often featured two sides sneering at each other’s ideas and policies and individuals not listening to good alternative policies simply because they originate from outside their own hard baked ideology (a classic example was the destruction of the local 20’s Plenty campaign, achieved by kicking a worthwhile project into the long grass of a “pilot project” and then those who kicked it never brought the results of that project back to council). Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets. The independent panel seems to have helped sort this out.\nHowever there is still some bad behaviour. During council meetings, councillors are frequently talking to their electorate in the council chamber and putting themselves onto social media. Councillor Nicola Day even took a team selfie during the meeting. Some appear to struggle to put their phone down and are constantly watching their phones while on a livestream. They embarrass Peterborough and its residents. It should be possible for councillors to switch their phones off during a meeting: it is professional to do so and it is simply good manners to give your full attention to the agenda and to your colleagues in a meeting.\nThe passage of the council’s budget on Wednesday was too tight for comfort, but compared with recent years, it was a welcome moment of calm organisation. I congratulate all those who worked constructively with Councillor Mohammed Jamil, Cabinet Member for Finance & Corporate Governance, whose approach has been consultative and consensual, to contribute to it and to vote for it. Hats off especially to Councillor Dennis Jones and to Councillor Wayne Fitzgerald. Without their closing speeches, their clarity and eloquence, this might not have passed and I strongly suspect that there was no superior alternative budget waiting in the wings. Passing any kind of workable budget in this era of badly managed economic decline (Westminster has never ended the “Austerity”) is nothing short of miraculous. I had high hopes for a new Labour government, but so far it has disappointed.\nWe have yet to see what happens as the independent supervisory panel finally walks away.\nThe council had leverage at that point. It needed to act when the residential developer was ready to rent or sell.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nfor me, it was a jaw on floor moment\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\n.. the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too ..\nAt 08:15 (once the programme ends) Just elected Paul Waugh MP (of all people!) describes, (as only a highly articulate, politically savvy and most importantly an experienced journalist could) what was going on there. I recognised his description as applicable to events in Peterborough. If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nIs a bad portrait worse than no portrait at all?\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nIt was close. After the Conservatives insisted on two recounts and then insisted on yet another check, the Park Ward result was finally agreed some time after three o’clock this morning. I got to bed at 4am. The full results for the Peterborough City Council elections are here. Votes for the first First Past The Post Police and Crime Commissioner election are still being counted.\nI am extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me and who supported me in this election. Everything you did means a lot. Thank you so very much.\nFor me, the campaign I was most concerned about was the one run by Kirsty Knight to retain her seat and I congratulate her very very warmly on achieving this despite having made a tough and gutsy decision to leave the Green Party just a few weeks prior to the election. Kirsty has almost certainly broken another election campaign record and she has certainly set an excellent precedent for Peterborough. Thank you everyone who has supported Kirsty.\nIt was noticeable to me that a couple of newbie Liberal Democrat candidates also won with remarkably short campaigns. Hats off to both of them too.\nI feel for Nick Sandford who has to continue to perform his duties as Mayor (until the Mayor making ceremony) despite losing his seat last night. I know he’ll see the funny side, but still. While Peterborough elects in thirds, surely, most years, the Mayor doesn’t have to be someone facing election in the same year? It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?",

But don’t let the deadline stop you. This post is to help you put a short sharp snappy objection in and was posted when the deadline was still 15 HOURS AWAY.\nTo register you need to say SOMETHING (you can come back and give more detail later) and the SOMETHING must include WHETHER OR NOT you support or object to the planning proposal and briefly WHY. You can always support one aspect and object to another. If you need a briefing on the issues, background information on the plans is provided on the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ website: here: http://www.kingscliffewastewatchers.co.uk/#/new-proposal/4535054364\nLinks to the planning portal and the Northamptonshire County Council process along with help on how to communicate your views within the planning process are included in this note from the Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers’ campaign.\n+++++++++++++++++++++\nHi All, Things are happening quickly now, and as you may have heard Northamptonshire County Council (NCC) has started its consultation over Augean’s application.\nThe process is similar to last time, i.e. Parish Councils and other local councils can indicate approval, or not, as can members of the public, as well as giving detailed reasons for their opinion.\nAlthough there are two applications in at once, things are not quite as muddled as they might seem. To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to. This is time-consuming, and you probably wouldn’t want to do exactly the same comments for each.\nAn alternative is to write (quoting all, or as many application references as you wish to object to) to:\nPlanning Services, Northamptonshire County Council, Floor 3, Guildhall Road Block, County Hall, Northampton, NN1 1DN, and to do this by email: developmentcontrol@northamptonshire.gov.uk\nWhen you view the application documents you will get a ‘pleasant’ surprise: there are about 50 of them! By all means wade through all of them, and find that little detail that will completely scupper their proposal. Alternatively, go down to Environmental Statement ‘Non-technical Summary’ and read something in a recognisable language: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Environmental%20Statement%20NTS.pdf\nIf you find something here that you don’t like, you can check up on the details in the main Environmental Statement.\nIn the Consultation Report – see Table CR3 Frequently Raised Questions (three-quarters of the way into the report) – has responses to many of our previous concerns, so you can judge how convincing Augean’s replies are: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/12.00029-31.WAS%20-%20Consultation%20Report.pdf\nBest wishes, CL, KCWW +++++++++++++++++++++",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_news_page_11/content_750.html": "The best thing I’ve read on the EU Referendum to date.\nI have been wrestling with how I am going to vote in the Euro referendum. I feel the Green Party of England and Wales rather rushed into supporting the “in” camp. It was decided by a single “emergency” motion at the conference in Bournemouth – well before Cameron had come up with his half-baked deal with Europe and a referendum date.\nTo me this was not the way the Green Party should have done this. An online ballot of all members would have been more suitable. It may well have reached the same outcome, but at least more people would have had a say.\nBut regardless of this conference “decision”, the Green Party is sensible enough not to force its members to speak with one voice and to tolerate those – like Jenny Jones and Rupert Read – who go against the party line on this.\nSo where do I…\nView original post 1,694 more words\nDear residents of Fletton & Stanground ward\nI write a week after polling day in order to thank you for your votes.\nThe voters in Fletton & Stanground voted thus:\n*Clark LAB 627\nFisher CON 434\n*Lillis LD 722\nMonk UKIP 623\nOsaman CON 384\nRadic GRN 237\nSlinger IND 261\nM Thulbourn LAB 529\nN Thulbourn LAB 522\n*Whitby UKIP 691\nWilliamson CON 406\nI can’t pretend I am not disappointed at coming last, but I am not surprised and I am happy to deprive the delightful Peter Slinger of last place!\nI’ve provided more detail here.\nI thought I’d share a couple of thoughts. The first is about “counting agents”. There was a recount for Fletton & Stanground called by UKIP, who were only three votes away from winning third place. The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.\nAttended\nJohn Peach CON\nBeki Sellick LD\nMohammad Yousaf CON\nAli Shan GREEN\nAbsent but sent apologies\nRichard Ferris LAB\nArfan Khan CON\nJohn Shearman LAB\nGraham Whitehead UKIP\nAbsent and no apology received (or read out)\nSabra Yasin LAB\nThis account is a transcription of my notes, intended solely for me and makes no pretensions to completeness.

I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.\nThe forecast was dire: rain and low temperatures. And a massive black cloud did come along and snowed on us and one very delighted little girl. Hail followed. But we stayed warm (oddly, it wasn’t all that cold). And we kept posting leaflets into letterboxes. But it was one of those days when focussing on broken bins and flytipped furniture and electrics was particularly difficult. The ghastly truth is that people (including me) get used to rubbish in their environment and we literally have no choice but to keep moving: to pass it by. We’d never do anything if we dealt with every bit. But sometimes the weather and the lovely stuff steals the show and that is what this afternoon was like. So here’s a photo narrative. The moon was in at least three photos, but now I can only find it in one. I stumbled on a beautiful red camellia in full flower in a south facing garden and some pelargoniums: they looked a bit dry but warm and also in full bloom but I didn’t photograph them.\nThe full text reads as follows:\n”\n|\nEXTRAORDINARY COUNCIL |\nAGENDA ITEM No. 3 |\n|\n13 APRIL 2016 |\nPUBLIC REPORT |\nMOTIONS ON NOTICE\nThe following notice of motion has been received in accordance with the Council’s Standing Order 13.1:\n1.

The election is scheduled for Friday 5th May 2023\nIt is brilliant that the Green Party is now a growing force on Peterborough City Council, able to represent more residents in more wards than ever before, and increasingly able and ready to influence policies followed by the councils’ larger political groups.\nWe are Crowdfunding\nIn May’s local elections scheduled for Friday 5th May, we plan to return experienced elected councillors to the council chamber and to win new councillors. To help achieve this we need to raise more money for printing than we’ve needed in any previous local election. What we raise will be used to print the leaflets which we distribute to residents. You can find out in detail how the money will be spent here.\nJoin our Crowd\nGreens often use Crowdfunding, which is a wonderful way to raise lots of small donations from a large community of people. We grow the “crowd” of donors by reaching out to include as many people in and beyond the city as we can reach.\nPlease share too\nThe cost of living means that many of the people who might usually feel able to donate, may not be able to do so this year. Please don’t feel bad, if this is the situation you are in. In the face of the crisis, we need to spread the word by sharing this post online, or by going to the Crowdfunder itself and sharing it from there. Shares also help!\nHenry Penn Walk collapse a third update\nI had a useful exchange of information with the journalist since my second update. They’ve got through to the council and have been told the council is now going after “GKL”. I thought I’d established that they built the building and, presumably the embankment which has subsequently collapsed. The journalist were now being told that this entity is the property manager (which took me completely by surprise). So, RHRL is out of the picture, just for the moment. Which is interesting because as of a couple of days ago, the council’s press office were saying they were going after/in dispute/had settled with RHRL. Weren’t they? Isn’t it the name in the local paper, linked in my second update? Now why would the council’s press office have been saying that if it wasn’t true? Please note that my first assumption is absolutely not that the press office has “made a genuine error” (as claimed by Cllr Fitzgerald over the entirely unrelated cheque gate affair. But that is a whole other scandal.)\nCould this mean that the council is now chasing after a relevant, genuinely responsible entity and that maybe flat owners will not be held liable for the repairs? If so, there is hope.\nNew morning. New search. Google search immediately produces possibly irrelevant\nand, likely more relevant, GKL BUILDING & CIVIL ENGINEERING LTD\nCompany number 07272683\nhttps://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07272683/filing-history?page=1\nTwo directors with significant influence or control.\nMr James Andrew Brackenbury ACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthAugust 1977NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlHas significant influence or control\nWho has a B Eng in Civil Engineering from Nottingham Trent.\nand\nMr Eamonn Michael Killoughery ACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthMay 1962NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlOwnership of shares – 75% or moreOwnership of voting rights – 75% or moreRight to appoint and remove directors\nwho is a big cheese in corporate director land, worthy of the translation of his skills and business interests into Russian.\nand 28 other companies. Including GKL DEVELOPMENTS (UK) LTD, Company number 05599784. So what we have is a large multi sector group of companies, with activities including waste disposal, road construction, property development and management.\nThe story that the developer went broke looks unconvincing, at first glance, anyway. And anyway, thinking about it, where did that story come from? And why am I aerated about the issue? Oh yes, of course: Facebook.\nI’m not sure why Cllr Fitzgerald is still blocking me. Maybe he’s still cross about the starring role he played in my top post of all time?\nSo there we were about midday Friday 20th January. I came back to finish this early this morning.\nHenry Penn Walk collapse a second update\nSince my first update on the collapse, the press got excited and phone calls were made. And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nThe Cambridge News published some of what I said along with a photo .\nPeterborough Telegraph believes the financial burden will fall upon the tenants of the block. I believe that this would be profoundly wrong and I will set out why in this second update.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nthat the approved planning application according to which the block was to be constructed is 96/00001/FUL | Validated: Mon 07 Oct 1996 | Status: Decided\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nBehind the sheeting is sand. Here is similar material taken from a picture about a road being built on the construction company’s Facebook page. This may or may not be what is behind the steel sheeting too.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.\nHenry Penn Walk collapse update\nHenry Penn Walk collapse update\nNeglect of City Centre River Walk on North Embankment of River Nene\nPhotos of the sorry state of collapsed Henry Penn Walk have been posted on Facebook by We Love Peterborough.\nI documented the state of the path in August 2021. You can compare WLP’s recent photo here with mine:\nfrom We Love Peterborough Facebook post 5 Jan 2023 my photo, slightly different angle, Aug 2021\nBut the problem pre dated my first blog on the subject by a long way. There is a closed report on the council’s website, dated 20th October 2020.\nSince I wrote that blog, I’ve been told that the reason nothing has been done to repair the broken path is that Peterborough City Council, (possibly Environment Agency) and one or more developers can’t agree on who owns the path and also that it was built out over the river without planning or any other kind of permission (I’m not sure what the procedure is for building out into a river). As ever I’m happy to be corrected if I have been misinformed this latter point. A slightly different story appeared almost a year ago, when a swift end to the legal tangle, (but apparently not involving the EA) was expected. It suggests that the council agrees it owns the surface of the path. But not its foundations. (Could that happen and if so, how could it have arisen?)\nA legal battle may make it awkward for the parties to it to speak to the press. But two of those parties are funded by the tax payer and the tax payer should be told why a solution and suitable repair could not precede settlement of the case. The costs could be recouped – if necessary – by means of a legal charge on the property. If the path is a property which was built by means of illegal invasion of the river, which seems a bit unlikely, what is the remedy in law? Does an illegal property exist or is it a bit like Schrödinger’s cat? Can a property which should not even be there be compulsorily purchased or confiscated? Can it even have an owner? Could a proper repair cost more than the value of a shoddy property (I’d bet it could). I think we should be told.\nMost unfortunately the council has set an awful precedent in Park Ward, where a drain it was given by Peterborough Development Corporation was built out into by a neighbouring property owner and a hideous building was given retrospective planning permission. So the council has established a flabby attitude to allowing people to develop beyond their own boundaries and into its watery properties (not something I condone or recommend).\nBut even if the story I was told holds water, it should be possible to find out who built a path on the bank capable of being washed away. While the flats were under construction, the whole site was fenced off, so the general public would not have been able to see anything. Is the organisation which built a soluble embankment still in business?\nIt should be possible to establish the position of the river bank before and after the flats were built. It should be possible to find out how many building regulations checks were performed as the flats were built and whether or not the rogue path was spotted or anything done about it during the flats’ construction. This is something the council’s planning department should be able to establish. I don’t have photographs. But someone must have some.\nI’ve been assured that no danger is posed to the buildings, but even if this is true, it is not the impression given by the landscaping: the dodgy path appears to have been held up by a steel retaining wall which has very definitely failed. It isn’t clear to the casual passer by (even if it is to the council’s structural engineering expert) what is holding the flats up. If the council’s building inspectors missed a dodgy retaining wall, can we be sure that they checked the one which may or may not be behind the dodgy one and which may or not be holding the embankment under the flats in place?\nThe path poses obvious hazards to pedestrians and cyclists and has, rightly, been closed. However repairs to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, even in Central Ward in Peterborough does not carry the priority it would if the route happened to carry cars. This despite the fact that the path is on the tourist trail. Peterborough remains a car crazy city and unattractive damage to the north bank river path persists apparently unnoticed by the city’s elected members. Voters should note that Cllr Jamil’s current term of office ends in May.\nStrike and Warm Hub Calendar\nPeterborough’s abnormal Winter 2022 will require unusual navigation\nHere comes some really cold weather and this winter, it will be so easy to hit a strike day unawares. Many people will not be focussing on getting out and about, struggling instead to keep warm with the help of government funded warm hubs. I knew about the council’s hubs, but doubted that people knew how to find them. Last time I’d looked there were about five. Today I found nineteen. The number and complexity of strikes is also exploding as perfectly understandable and justifiable discontent escalates. I’d prefer if this public calendar didn’t stay true for very long, but it is true today. If wage disputes were settled and people received the incomes at levels they need, this Strikes & Warm Hubs Calendar could very quickly be made redundant. But unfortunately only the ruling Tories who make up this awful Westminster government can do that.\nBourges Boulevard floods again\nWhy Bourges Boulevard continues to flood – some possible reasons\nIt is remarkable that Peterborough City Council and Anglian Water can’t seem to get together to clear and improve drainage on Bourges Boulevard just south of the roundabout at Town Bridge. Flooding at this location often happens in very heavy rain and is reported in the local paper, which used to have its big blue sign on a fancy modern office overlooking the roundabout. (The Peterborough Telegraph has since moved out of the city centre.)\nSo what is going wrong?\nAre Anglian Water and the City Council not talking to one another?\nIt seems maybe not. This is not the only location in the city blighted by what looks like an inter authority communication problem.\nFlooding can follow observations of bad smells. It did this time: a reader notes this in a comment to the article. A smell of sewage is a big signal that drains might be blocked somewhere.\nSo are people not reporting poo pongs to Anglian Water?\nWell, oddly, it isn’t possible to report or describe this particular phenomenon accurately using Anglian Water’s ludicrously coy website. There is no free text field on its reporting forms, and every option avoids any mention of the blocking or the contents of sewers.\nI recently tried to report this problem at a different location and stumbled across this inexplicable reporting obstacle. The closest to a poo-stink-likely-to-be-a-drainage-problem I was able to report referred me to the “local drainage authority” (which in Peterborough is Peterborough City Council). Anglian Water’s reporting system also asks for my water account details, which are as relevant to a drainage problem wherever I happen to find it as my inside leg measurement. So, a bit cross, I rang them up. I know this is inadequate, but it is all I can recommend at the moment. So\nIf you smell poo, do a number one and a number two:\none: telephone Anglian Water on 0345 145 145\nand\ntwo: phone Peterborough City Council on 01733 747474\nIf anyone can identify a not so intrusive email address for Anglian Water, please put it in the comments, below. If you are happy to provide details of your personal water account (if you have one) when reporting an issue in the public realm you can report it using Anglian Water’s online form.\nIs Peterborough City Council a competent drainage authority?\nI’m not sure that the council is aware that when Peterborough Development Corporation handed its brief and assets over to the council, that package included drainage assets and all drainage authority responsibilities. The drainage boards outside the boundary of the council can be found online and there is local democratic involvement in their management: they are active and if there were to be a problem there is a democratic remedy available to local people. Peterborough City Council seems to think that if it ignores them, its drainage assets will look after themselves. This is certainly what happened in Park Ward, when a development on, and its “foundations” in a drain was permitted and the council remarkably failed to assert ownership of the drainage ditch (which it nevertheless clears from time to time). The development made the ditch less manageable and this resulted in a viable long term prospective asset owner walking away. But whatever its position since PDC handed drainage over to it, it has not been able to evade its responsibilities since 2010, when a law was enacted:\n“County and Unitary Authorities have been made Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs) under the Flood & Water Management Act 2010 with responsibilities to prepare and maintain a strategy for local flood risk management in their areas; maintain a register of flood management assets; investigate significant local flooding incidents; issue consents for altering, removing or replacing certain structures or features on ordinary watercourses (outside of Internal Drainage Districts) and play a lead role in emergency planning and recovery after a flood event.” https://www.ada.org.uk/member_type/local-authorities/\nAre Peterborough’s elected members aware of the council’s inherited drainage responsibilities?\nEvidence that they do is welcome.\nIs Peterborough City Council adequately funded to manage its drainage responsibilities?\nLegacy funding was never made available to the council when PDC was abruptly removed from continuing its work to develop and improve Peterborough. This explains the council’s ongoing difficulties funding the maintenance of the landscape the PDC built, including the Green Wheel. Central government has owed the city development infrastructure legacy funding since PDC left. In better economic times, it might have been possible to blur this. But now that the council is up against predictably far heavier rain (due to climate change) and impossible cuts (due to appalling decisions by central government), it makes sense now to claim what’s been due. The city has two MPs. The two of them should be able to do this for the city. They should also know whether other unitary authorities are also owed this funding.\nSo, until I find evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that no, it isn’t.\nIs Peterborough City Council competent to manage drainage and sewer works?\nI welcome evidence that it is. The prevalence of sewage pongs suggests it isn’t. As do the reports listed on the Anglian Water website, which lists long standing sewer repairs still not completed.\nOde to Peterborough’s MP\nHe loved so hard: he loved Joris Bohnson Who lied each time he put his pants on. Pissed on the standards and the regulations And fuddled on land as he mined the oceans. Then he loved Liz Truss who’s gone already Lasted less well than the iceberg lettuce. But leaving left a legacy far more impressive: For she buried a Queen, the Pound and the Tory party.\nInspired by a pre-departure tweet about Liz Truss, who resigned yesterday. “She will be gone soon. Her legacy is actually quite impressive; she buried the Queen, the Pound and the Tory party.\" H. Ickx @FT comments section With thanks to https://twitter.com/DarrenDarker/status/1582104732877066240\nIs that a clue in that crack?\nTomatoes grow on Peterborough’s embankment\nAn enormous crack opened up on Henry Penn Walk and was reported (with extraordinary drone photos taken from above it) on 4th March 2021 in Peterborough Matters when a council spokesperson is reported to have said, “The current state of the walkway is a result of the structure, sheet piling, beneath the path falling.” On 2nd August 2021 the Peterborough Telegraph reported that the council and a corporate landowner were still at odds over who is responsible for the maintenance of this structure. This is an extraordinary standoff, given that a river is a highly dynamic entity, with carving into land and carrying it away away its favourite and constant sport. The embankment constitutes its urban restraint. Wouldn’t it make sense to fix the damage first and then sort out who owed how much in the courts? A few days ago I went to see whether or not the crack had been repaired I found a larger crack than I expected. Close up, the embankment undulates as if there’d been an earthquake or a landslip. A sort of fountain of subsoil sits at could conceivably be the source of the damage (if it got there by being thrust up right out of the ground). It is as if if water got stuck somewhere and had to burst up through what is a remarkably deep layer of tarmac. And guess what is growing just where that pile of subsoil is? Yes. Tomatoes. Of course, they could have been planted in an apartment garden. But wild tomatoes are common in the UK and they are celebrated self seeders. They can be spotted growing happily along railway tracks and wherever human manure distributes their tiny tell tale seeds. So my question is, given Anglian Water’s discovery of a major sewer works scandal not so very far away, at the junction of Wentworth Street and Bourges Boulevard this July (also reported to the council and in our local paper), has Anglian Water investigated whether or not something equally stinky might lurk beneath Peterborough embankment’s spectacular crack? Could damage to, neglect of, a blockage in or a fault in the drains cause damage on this scale? Or, conversely, could the crack have damaged a foul drain, enabling a tell tale seed or two to escape? After all, what force is there, other than water, capable of taking the huge corrugated steel retaining wall holding the embankment in place and bending it out of true? I’m no expert, but I can see that the embankment wall is not vertical any more. My theories about water transporting sewage carrying tomato seeds and pushing steel walls around might both be fanciful. But if anyone has a more sensible explanation, do tell.\nWasting parliamentary time\nThe incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small.\nThis post Brexit government seems remarkably keen to solve microscopic and even non existent problems. The incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small. Very effective UK legislation to tackle vote fraud is already in place. QED Vote fraud does not need new legislation.\nHowever imposing “voter ID” is highly likely to have undesirable, oppressive and discriminatory effects and our UK government and our MP know this. Because making it harder to vote suppresses the vote in groups which find things hard anyway.\nBut there would be no harm in raising voter awareness of vote fraud. Vote fraud can and has been effectively detected and prosecuted: here in Peterborough and elsewhere. In fact, anybody taking part in the electoral process can spot vote fraud and report it (as long as they know what to look out for). Moreover it is already a statutory responsibility of the police to protect our democratic systems. If you witness vote fraud while it is actually happening, call the police on 999. If you’ve seen it in the past, report it online. It is a crime, like any other. If our MP is aware of instances which have not been detected, reported and prosecuted, perhaps he could explain what advice he gave those who witnessed a crime and what the police did with all those reports?\nIf my MP believes that the incidence of what he believes is a problem is statistically higher than extremely rare in the UK or if a vote fraud has ever been shown to have influenced the result of an election, perhaps he or our new Police and Crime Commissioner could produce the evidence? Evidence of crime can overturn an election result in the UK, which is exactly as it should be. But while not having enough evidence to substantiate your case can be expensive when an accusation goes to court (as happened after Peterborough’s own 2019 by election) wasting his constituents’ time is not chargeable to our MP and even more unfortunately (given the urgency of what needs doing in parliament) no offence of wasting parliamentary time has yet been put on the statute book. Perhaps it should be?",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2019_12_09_why-not-vote-tactically/content_330.html": "For people who’d like to vote Green\nThis post is for would be Green voters. But if your preference happens to be for a different party which has a history of not getting a proportionate number of candidates elected per votes cast, then this is for you too.\nEvery general election Green voters are bombarded with messages to vote for another party. Teams of people argue why on social media. Every general election is special for some unique reason and so, just this once, voters need to vote for someone they don’t really like, because the candidate/party they don’t really like happens to be less objectionable than the candidate most likely to win. So this year, in 2019, this Thursday, this general election is special because we are told that we are not really voting for our own area’s candidates on the ballot paper at all: we are voting for or against “Brexit”. The two main parties principal messages are about their opposite leader (as if that really made a difference outside their constituencies).\nEven people who are not absorbed in the detail know this is not OK.\nIf you live in a safe constituency\nIf the last winning majority was, say, over 2,000 votes, you can vote for your favourite candidate full stop.\nThis is because how you vote simply won’t make any difference to the result.\nIf you live in a marginal\nYou might have to think rather more carefully. But of course 2,000 is just a random number. There are levels of marginality and you need to decide where to draw the line in your constituency. Go here to see the effect of marginality across the country and in your area.\nIf you want to vote tactically\nYou also need to understand why you are doing it. People who are not sufficiently well informed are highly vulnerable to manipulation and misdirection. Check what you believe is true. Check your own reasoning:\n-\n- Are you wanting to stop the Tories?\n- Are you wanting to ensure the UK remains in the EU?\nDepending on what your objective is, a tactical vote might or might not make sense. Here is a comparison, on one tactical voting website, of other websites. However, it makes no sense to simply take any website’s advice. Who runs the site and why are they putting time and resources into it? Which organisations run or promote them? What is motivating them?\nBut let us suppose that despite doing all of the above a tactical vote or voting for your favourite party are still options for you.\nWhich to choose? How to decide? What are the ramifications?\n-\n- Could you really tip the result?\n- How does your tactical option benefit the party which gets your tactical vote?\n- How does your decision not to vote with your heart affect the party you really love?\nIs it really only about one vote this time?\nAre you happy to deprive your favourite party of:\n-\n- encouragement\n- support\n- finance – they may lose future income in the form of “short money”\n- their deposit (£500 per constituency is only returned by the government to candidates who win over 5% of votes cast)\nThe UK voting system needs reform so that people are free to make a genuine vote rather than a so called tactical one.\nOne tactical vote or two million tactical votes will not fix broken First Past The Post. It doesn’t matter how well informed your vote is: how crafty you are. On your own you can’t stop people being misled by people who benefit from people being misled any more than I can. (But you could share this post.)\nNeither The Labour Party nor The Conservative & Unionist Party are interested in any form of voting system reform. If you vote for either of them you are supporting and entrenching the problematic First Past The Post voting system. It makes no sense at all to vote tactically to benefit either of them.\nThe deposit system was brought in to deter candidates who were not serious. What The Green Party stands for should not cost us so much, but while it still does, we need all the votes we can get.\nIn conclusion\n-\n- Vote Green on Thursday\n- Donate to us to keep us standing and communicating\n- Thank you for reading so far.

This one from Cllr John Shearman (here he is).\nFirst of all he apologises for not replying sooner. Frankly speediness of response is not the most important thing to me. And since I wrote about a jargon-prone subject which most people would find technical, difficult and tedious an over speedy response really wouldn’t impress me.\nBut offering an apology for responding within a week achieves so much. Starting like this says to me (these are my words, not his) “Hello, I am a human being with manners and I understand the common courtesies. Moreover I have standards: they are mine and…..”\nI don’t need to go on. And nor will I copy onto my blog the content of his response or our subsequent conversations. That would be impolite: he has expressed himself to me honestly, frankly and (absolutely critically important to me, and to anything relating to planning) he comes over as open-minded and prepared to listen. That is what I think people expect of a ward councillor.\nAnd, best of all, from what he says I can see that he has done his homework and understands the incinerator campaign work which has being quietly going on in the city. His email is a very tiny but very concise executive summary of how the situation actually is. Hats off.\nThank you, John.\nI am still waiting for a response from the third of my ward councillors.\nincineration decision: a first response\nYesterday I wrote to my ward councillors. Today I opened an email, sent last night at 20:51. My first response! Here it is:\n“I have evaluated all your points & have complete confidence in the Council to do the right thing. If you had your way, we would all be living in caves.\nCllr Pam Kreling”\nWho is she? Here she is. (and the email address she used to respond!) This is one of my ward councillors, and she serves on no fewer than eight council committees, including Planning and Environmental Protection, Audit and, of all things: Strong and Supportive Communities.\nincineration decision: letter to ward councillors\nToday I wrote in the following terms to my ward councillors, copying in my MP.\nmass burn incinerator for household waste\nI invite your comments on how you have protected the interests of the residents of my ward and of the city in the years since 2007 in this matter.\nShould the council reconsider what it is doing: What would the costs of pulling out of this contract be today? And tomorrow (assuming it is signed tomorrow)?\nHave you checked whether or not the council considered options other than incineration? What evidence of careful consideration of other options are you relying on? Are you aware that the council has been consistently challenged on this since 2007, (and possibly earlier)?\nAre you aware that the business cases for incineration in general and for this particular incinerator are both now being challenged as unsafe (the economy and the market having changed substantially)? Have you considered the financial impact on council tax payers should these cautions turn out to be well founded? And that if the business performs as badly as expected are you aware of the likely impact on recycling, too?\nHas the contract been set up in such a way that it can attract structural or grant funding? Or has it been set up in such a way that it is ineligible?\nAre you aware of the total cost of this contract? Figures of £76M and £80M have been quoted recently in the Peterborough Evening Telegraph for the capital costs alone. Is that figure current? What are the overall 30 year costs for this project? Is it acceptable that this information is still not in the public domain? Is it acceptable that innocent readers of their local paper might assume that this figure is the total cost of the project?\nAre you aware that the council is deliberately choosing out of date technology and describing it as “tried and tested”? (the information on technology is still not in the public domain).\nAre you aware that the council might be comparing the energy recovery of its own plant with Scandinavian examples? If so are you aware that in Scandinavia (which is used to colder weather and historically much more aware of the importance of insulation and energy security) high performance hot water supply grids are planned in (eg for swimming pools or district heating). Peterborough has not planned a supply grid and has not explained who will buy energy and power generated by this incinerator. Have you seen an example of the output and recovery figures from either Peterborough’s as planned and have you compared that with an operational equivalent in Scandinavia and an operational equivalent in the UK (local campaigners are finding that those in the UK can’t sell their power).\nAre you aware that the UK’s statutory regulatory regime for air pollution (in which the council has placed its trust) is widely regarded as unfit for purpose? The Health Protection Agency is about to undertake research into whether or not it can substantiate the assurances and claims it has been making and upon which the Environment Agency and numerous councils have historically relied. Is the council aware of the potential damage it could do to its own Environment Capital “aspiration” if, as widely expected, it can’t?\nDo you know enough about air pollution and monitoring in the city? Does Peterborough monitor anything other than road traffic? Where are the monitoring stations and are they in the right places? What regime is planned for when the incinerator is operational?\nHave you considered the social, health and cost impacts on the city of a mass burn incinerator in an area with very high (and rising) levels of social deprivation?\nAre you aware that a new incinerator on an industrial site in Fletton is operating and is apparently making people ill, but that the council has not done anything about it, and that not one person amongst the “officers’ panel” and members present at the Sustainable Growth and Environment Capital Scrutiny Committee Call in Meeting on 29th August was equipped to advise the ward councillor who asked about this problem in his ward? I understand that the ward councillor had been told by the Environment Agency that it was a matter for the council. As a member of the public I witnessed that not a single person actually knew how to deal with this relatively small problem – nobody offered to look into it or explain who the ward councillor should talk to, if it wasn’t the Environment Agency. This is despite the presence of senior council officers and (at least) three lawyers.\nAre you satisfied with the monitoring and regulation of pollution in the city?\nPlease can Richard Olive have answers to the questions which Peterborough Friends of the Earth has asked the council on this matter?\nCan you write NONE against – or otherwise provide detail of any personal, family or party interest you have had, have or are likely to have – in any of the following:\n- the council’s Energy Services Company?\n- “Blue Sky”?\n- this sector?\n- this decision?\nI look forward to hearing from you, etc.\nMini Sit-in at Call-in\nLast night the committee with a very long name about which I have blogged previously met again, this time to consider a Call-In Request. It met to decide whether or not to call-in the decision made by Deputy Leader Councillor Matthew Lee (CONSERVATIVE) to make Viridor the preferred bidder to run the council’s planned incinerator (Lot 1).\nThe members of this committee are:\n- Councillor Marion Todd (Chairman)\n- Councillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman)\n- Councillor Mohammed Nadeem\n- Councillor Yasmeen Maqbool\n- Councillor Stuart Martin\n- Councillor Nick Thulbourn\n- Councillor Judy Fox\n- Councillor Dale McKean (Reserve)\n- Councillor Lisa Forbes (Reserve)\n- Councillor Chris Ash (Reserve) (source: Peterborough City Council)\nCllr Maqbool had given advance notice of her absence and Cllr Dale McKean attended in her place.\nAt the end of about four hours of lengthy, soporific, off topic but occasionally revelatory proceedings the committee decided 4 to 3 to reject the request for a call-in.\nVoted AGAINST calling in the decision (and therefore supporting Cllr Lee’s decision)\nCouncillor Marion Todd (Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Graham Casey (Vice Chairman) CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Mohammed Nadeem CONSERVATIVE\nCouncillor Dale McKean (Reserve) CONSERVATIVE\nVoted FOR calling in the decision (and supporting reference back to Full Council or decision maker, but unable to vote for either option since the other vote took place first)\nCouncillor Stuart Martin LABOUR\nCouncillor Nick Thulbourn LABOUR\nCouncillor Judy Fox INDEPENDENT\nThe meeting began at 6pm with Apologies and Declaration of Interests. No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2019_01_30_political-advertising-and-social-media-part-two/content_308.html": "Social media offers politicians a very tempting way of doing all sorts of things. To my mind, there is nothing wrong with that. On the face of it.\nBut what people reading things on social media don’t always know is that there are laws governing political messaging and advertising, and also that social media offers ingenious ways of getting round rules.\nOne of the UK rules is to do with imprints: basically an imprint allows the reader to understand who is behind what they are reading. In turn this allows the reader to check who is behind whatever or whoever is being promoted. Look for the small print on any political flier which is delivered through your letterbox. You should find it. It is a legal requirement.\nThis “imprint” is key to finding out who is being promoted (usually a candidate) and (with this knowledge) who is funding a political campaign, and yes, there is also UK legislation surrounding political donations to UK campaigns. Another legal requirement is to obey the laws about donations.\nCampaigners in Peterborough found a piece of printed material which lacked an imprint during the EU Referendum campaign. This was reported to the Electoral Commission. It is an offence to omit an imprint, although this A5 flier wasn’t impressive and at first glance this is not a big thing. It could always be someone who is a newcomer to political campaigner and who doesn’t know any better. That’s wrong, but understandable. But….\nThe imprint rules for social media advertising by political entities have no legal force behind them. They are merely recommendations laid down by the Electoral Commission indicating basic standards of good practice. This leaves people who know very much better than a beginner able to advertise on social media, deliberately concealing the organiser, the cause, the funder and the objectives. One I think fits this description crossed my path recently.\nHere’s me, picking up on someone’s comment that an image in a facebook advertisement featured comes from a Third Reich archive. It reminded me of a certain Prime Ministerial field of wheat. Even the wheat is old fashioned: we don’t grow it tall like that any more. We’re in the realms of nostalgia.\nHere’s his tweet:\n…….\n…….\nWhat seized my interest is that I’ve already seen the image out of the corner of my eye. It has already crossed my facebook feed, but as I was doing something else (as I usually am) I paid it no attention: I registered the image, but didn’t read the text. This is how subliminal advertising works. But now that someone has said something astonishing about the picture the advertisement, text and picture, now has my full attention. So (apologising for the format – it looks so much better on twitter!) here we go:\nThis looks like an operation to collect email addresses and to raise funds: but it will have to be funded by someone, somewhere. I and every other person who encounters this should be able to see who is doing what and for whom. We can’t.\nPart one was an email, and isn’t on my blog.\nHappy to be corrected: I looked at this a few days ago and just went over what I did. Nothing much has changed, except the organisation now claims it is in the UK (but doesn’t provide an address) and the entity the website claims is editing it is apparently also in the UK: https://twitter.com/rjdavies7 I have no idea if these two accounts relate to the same human being.",

I recognised his description as applicable to events in Peterborough. If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_sustainable_page_2/content_113.html": "I have asked people why the council hadn’t gone all out to fund a replacement bridge as soon as it realised Rhubarb Bridge was suffering an unusual degree of decay. This would have made sense, especially since there are national funding pots for sustainable travel infrastructure, and this bridge might well have qualified.\nI wrote a post about the stakeholder event, at which my question did not receive an answer.\nSince then I have I received one really useful reply. My interlocutor pointed out to me that the money for repairs and maintenance comes out of the Revenue pot at the council. Revenue is for running costs, costs which recur year after year. The money for the an surface roundabout or for a replacement bridge would come out of the Capital pot. Capital is for one off costs, for buying or building assets such as buildings and infrastructure.\nThis made me think. Pressure on the Revenue pot is extreme. And it might be this extreme funding pressure which is leading to a decision not to maintain. If it replaces an an annual maintenance bill with a one off capital bill (with arguably a smaller ongoing maintenance cost), it will be relieving pressure on the funds which are needed to look after people in extreme need.\nFunding pressures on local government affect their Revenue funding primarily. Pressure on capital funding is not as bad. Revenue funds are used to fund social care, road repairs and waste disposal. It is this funding stream which is under impossible strains as central government imposes its Austerity measures and renders all our services less and less able to cope. So all local authorities have to balance roads and waste against social care. It is quite clearly insane, but until we sack the government as we are entitled to do at each general election, there is no sign of a change in this wicked situation. And local authority roads get a small fraction of the maintenance money which Highways England gets to maintain trunk roads. Unfortunately Rhubarb Bridge does not belong to Highways England. It belongs to the council.\nThis leaves a number of items which haven’t been accounted for: lets call them uncounted elephants in the room:\n- The likely cost of accidents at an at surface crossing. It is clear that this has not been factored in. There is clearly an increased risk of impacts on emergency, hospital and care services budgets.\n- The impact of being at ground level at an air pollution hot spot on all pedestrian and cyclists using the route. The higher you are the less likely you are to be inhaling high concentrates of particulates. The closer you are the more certain it is. In pushchairs children are face to face with exhaust pipes and this is just one reason (of many) why parents pop them in what seems to be the safer environment of a car.\n- The at surface crossing will result in cyclists taking to the road, rather than wait.\n- The at surface crossing will result in people getting into a car in preference to walking with a pram or pushchair.\nAnd it leaves my original question standing: why the council hasn’t tried to get hold of (let us add “capital”) funding to rebuild the bridge – if it is beyond economic repair?",

Help spread the word: download and print electoral fraud poster 1 (sorry it isn’t beautiful, please send in your or a fresh or newer version!)\nMy MP emailed me and he said:\nThank you for contacting me about fracking, I understand your concerns with this matter and appreciate your correspondence.\nShale gas is a promising new potential energy resource which could reduce our reliance on imported gas and help with keeping energy costs low. It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough\nI emailed my MP and I said:\nI am writing to ask you to vote against the Government’s changes to the Infrastructure Bill on fracking that remove any guarantee that drinking water sources will be protected from fracking, and to call for an immediate fracking moratorium.\nThe changes made in the House of Lords weaken several of the 13 conditions accepted by Government in the House of Commons, including vital provisions to protect drinking water from fracking.\nPlease vote to ensure fracking is banned in all ground water source protection zones 1 – 3.\nAlthough these protections would make fracking safer, they cannot make it safe because fracking is inherently risky, and would exacerbate climate change.\nI am therefore asking that you call for an immediate fracking moratorium in the House of Commons. While the UK Government attempts to weaken the few protections we have, the rest of Britain is taking measures to protect the health of communities and the climate.\nI urge you call on Government to follow the lead of Wales and Scotland by bringing forward an immediate fracking moratorium so that the risks to health and climate change can be fully investigated.\nThe sooner we follow in the footsteps of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, New York State, Denton (Texas) – and the rest of Britain – by stopping fracking, the better for our communities, the climate and our local environment.\nYours Sincerely,\nFiona Radic\nDid Peterborough police arrest a homeless man…\n.. without reading him his rights?\nAre Peterborough cyclists cannibals now?\nI’ve blogged before about Peterborough and the attitude to cyclists held by the Leader of the Council and the centre of the city has just experienced “aggressive pavement cyclists” targeted by police. (I deplore the use of a word like “aggressive” to stereotype a wide community which cycles on pavements.)\nBut here we go again, this time with a word which suggests one superior tribe (maybe driving Chelsea tractors?) looking down on another primitive and uncivilised group (maybe all these things because they can’t afford a Chelsea tractor?).\nGiven that bicycles can’t really eat one another, I assume the police peep believes that the cyclists are stealing each others’ bicycles? I’m really not sure how such a useless assertion will help the police catch thieves.

It starts in Paston Ward and travels through Northborough Ward in the Peterborough unitary authority area (governed by Peteborough City Council).\nIt then enters the Lincolnshire County Council & South Holland District Council areas where it travels through county & district wards: Crowland & Deeping St Nicholas, Moulton (Weston and Cowbit) and Spalding St Mary’s\nIt also passes through the following parishes:\nNewborough, Borough Fen (Peterborough)\nCrowland, Cowbit, Weston and Spalding South (South Holland, Lincolnshire)\nIt travels through two parliamentary constituencies: that of Peterborough Borough and South Holland and the Deepings.\nThe Fletton Parkway is the A1139\nThe roadworks which are currently underway and which have hit a £4.5M size brick are within the following areas of local government:\nparliamentary constituency: North West Cambridgeshire\nunitary authority area: Peterborough City Council\nunitary authority wards: Orton Waterville, Orton Longueville and Orton with Hampton\nparishes: Orton Waterville, Orton Longueville (and an unparished area)\nFurther reading\nNew Listerner\nPeterborough Telegraph\n30th January http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/politics-news/contaminated-soil-and-new-works-land-city-council-with-4-5-million-roads-bill-1-6549612\nWas there a Clerk of Works?\nOh! Again. Check out the last frame!\nTo the best of my knowledge Clerk of Works is currently not a role within the organisation structure of Peterborough City Council (I can’t find the role on their website). Happy as always to be corrected.\nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST – FOI-14-0299 A1139 Fletton Parkway\nAlthough it looks from this document as if there were “site supervision and clerk of works functions” identified, it is clear that one contractor to the council appointed another contractor to the contractor to perform the roles. This is not the same as having one qualified person on one’s own team and begs the question who the possibly qualified person was. Happy as always to be corrected.\nIf Clerk of Works is the role which secures budgetary control (see above video), why isn’t Morson (the contractor apparently covering the role) picking up 100% of the £4.5M cost overrun? One way to establish the reason for this would be to subject the relevant contracts and subcontracts to scrutiny by a person competent in law of contract.\nPersonally, if I were the council I’d bring the role of Clerk of Works straight back in-house to establish and secure a clear line of responsibility and management. A good properly qualified person in this role could save the city a fortune over time. I know that breathtaking achievements (even if you only count the beans) are often made, quietly and without a brass band, by people doing this sort of job for other organisations.\nInformation on the history of the role of Clerk of Works within Peterborough City Council’s remit very welcome.\nThe hidden history of wind power in Peterborough\nI am convinced that the design of wind turbines is still in its infancy. Having said that, I don’t really understand why people are sometimes quite rabidly opposed to the air fix propellor on a stick model, which is doing such a great job all over Europe. Yes they are very engineer-y. Yes they are so clearly using technology used in the aircraft industry. Yes, they are very very masculine and depending on where they are put they can be a little domineering. But how could it be otherwise? These are the soldiers: the vanguard of the wind generation revolution: these massive rotators fight to get the tiniest bit of political support, they are the machines which have to demonstrate massive power potential in locations remote from their own consumers. They have not picked their territory: they are nobly fighting to secure a place in the same antiquated network model as the fossil and nuclear power generators we need to replace: not necessarily the ideal battle field for wind. When you look at one of the larger structures you cannot fail to recognise the language of aeroplanes including their use in warfare: even if your awareness is purely instinctive or unconscious. Perhaps that is part of the negativity they sometimes attract. Here they are in cheerful, colourful mode doing their bit to explain and defend the work of the wind energy industry (and attracting the usual derisory moans and grizzles).\nBut while this massive battle rages, delicate vertical axis models have been available for ages (look up VAWT ). They have been quietly dancing, spinning curvaceously, unobtrusively, like wine glasses or a flimsy dress picking up the tiniest, the slightest breath of wind. The delicacy of what they can do doesn’t always get as far as Youtube, where up-loaders succumb to the prevailing pressure to post videos showing how fast, rather than how slow they can go. Here is one going pretty fast and working flat out for a Welsh school:\nA decade ago I felt that the VAWTs might be the future, with their much more feminine profiles, greater potential to blend in and work quietly, more decoratively and much less obtrusively. Unhampered by lurking military resonances. Would they last longer, situated as they can be in much less exposed settings? Would they prove more resilient? They look good near trees and buildings and they work hard in community settings, right alongside the consumer of the power they generate, wasting much less in the grid. I have wondered: would these smaller sideways turners be the future? They certainly don’t seem to generate the same vituperative anti wind spin. If they haven’t already caught your attention look up “vertical axis wind turbine” on Youtube. You will find a huge international ideas festival of designs and the international community of people: engineers, technicians, artists… working on them, in their gardens, in their schools, in their workshops and factories.\nThen there are the millions of people fascinated by the decorative potential of wind.\nThis isn’t a wind turbine: it is a moving sculpture and it talks maths, jellyfish and snowflakes. It appeals to wind chime enthusiasts, garden designers. But can you imagine something like it gently turning on The Green Backyard and providing power? Or in one of Peterborough’s parks? Couldn’t something a little simpler go on your chimney? Couldn’t wind power look stunning?\nConsidering its location, the unitary authority area of Peterborough has astonishingly low levels of wind generated power. Personally I assume this has to do with its politics. It can’t be to do with its engineering skill base. But did you know that Peterborough does have a well hidden history of wind turbine investigation, if not early adoption? But it is so well hidden that you could be driven to wonder whether it might actually have been concealed. You have to be in the know to have even found out that there is something to look for. I know that someone tried and where it happened: but I only know a tiny bit about it, but it doesn’t make sense: there isn’t a narrative which tells the story. I am sure there must be more to it than I have been able to discover. I also don’t know why this early attempt at wind power generation fell so early and failed to progress. Who or what stopped it in its tracks? Was it really just lack of money? Could that have been what scuppered it? I for one don’t know what happened. I am inviting you to share what you know with me privately using this form or publicly in the comments section:\nPeterborough City Council Full Council: 17 December 2014\nThis is a set of recordings of Full Council. This list was made to help follow these recordings of the event, which are a bit fiddly to follow on Youtube.\nThe crackle and static are not coming from the recording: they are coming from the council’s own sound system. I am particularly interested in what readers think of this system, which I am given to believe was installed by Serco.\nHats off to Chris York, championing transparency and political accountability. I think it is a tribute to Peterborough’s politicians and politicians elsewhere too, not just the elected councillors that making recordings of debates like this has become possible. As far as I am aware it was always legal, but people have been being slung out of public galleries over the past couple of years for recording events.\nFaced with so many challenges, eventually Westminster was forced to make a ruling and councils now have no choice but to give permission. This is the first council meeting I have attended where there was no prohibition notice on the seats in the “Spectators Gallery”.\nThis shows how some of the best interactions happen behind the scenes and outside the chamber. And some require the sort of skills and technical know how which might not be present in the chamber itself. Well done Chris York.",

I live in the middle of the ward and this is Peterborough’s heart. So many things begin here, so many children come here to school and then to college and the whole ward is wrapped around Central Park, laid out by the Peterborough Land Company as a gated garden, though when that private initiative collapsed quickly converted by the then local authority into a breathing space for the free use of residents of what was then a bustling, industrious and densely populated area. Also, the ward (which almost exactly follows the All Saints parochial parish council boundary) is heart shaped.\nHow Park Ward seemed thirty years ago\nWhen we moved here, I didn’t know much about this area at all. Two things impressed me. I’d never seen people so down at heel: one day I walked along behind an elderly couple who were both wearing shoes with no heels left at all and worn out soles. I’d never seen anything like it.\nThe other very remarkable thing was the cleanliness of the homes and streets. Despite having some very very deprived streets, this ward was clean and tidy as a pin. I’d come from a much bigger city and felt I was somewhere green, clean and very proud of itself. When I first went doorknocking over ten years ago, people wanted to invite me into their yards and show me how they were managing their recycling. Peterborough had big green recycling boxes then and people would wash their plastics before putting them safely under heavier items, so that recycled waste did not blow around.\nThis area was full of beautiful front gardens: cars were parked on drives and on the street, not all over the garden. Back gardens, park gardens and allotment gardens were tended with skill, time and patience. There was time for our gardens then. You can still find some magical gardens here, but so many have been paved and converted into car storage spaces. With the loss of jobs with decent terms and conditions has come a loss of leisure time.\nHow the rot set in\nNow I know that what I was seeing was the achievement of the Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC ) and Peterborough City Council (PCC) was a local authority which was still funded to run services fairly well. But although I couldn’t see it, rot had already set in. The PDC was already not able to leave a funding legacy to enable the city council to look after the landscape it created. The Conservatives preventing local councils from building council homes and Labour doing nothing despite three terms in government to put it right. Deregulation creating economic turbulence, financial crashes, disappearing investment markets and pensions. All that fuelled a new generation of private slum landlord, the worst of them using property primarily as a personal financial investment and not seeing a rented home as first and foremost a social good. Housing became a source of extreme insecurity and vulnerability as decent jobs with proper pensions became a thing of the past.\nThe big squeeze on local authority funding puts the city council itself at risk\nCharles Swift OBE today eloquently describes the pickle the council is in and councillors themselves are finally waking up and realising that they need to fight for the city, and for local government itself. We’ve seen Northamptonshire County Council collapse and Peterborough may not be so far behind.\nLoyalty to party has made local councillors insufficiently critical of national governments and blinded them to the risks posed by councils which cannot afford to do what they want to do, even what they have to do. At the moment in Peterborough, our Westminster government is not our friend. It is less accountable to us than the EU and it is less aware of and less articulate about our problems. At last our local councillors have woken up to the shabby disproportionate underfunding of this city.\nFit for purpose waste management\nAs a Green I want to bring back the neighbourhood as a place people can feel comfortable in and proud of. This is our home and nobody enjoys the neglect our area currently suffers. Fly tip and domestic waste flying around in the wind is not a necessary or inevitable part of living here. We urgently need to get the place feeling like home again. We need a waste strategy which works for every single resident, whether they have physical strength and a car or not.\nBring back gardening\nI’d like Park Ward to develop its own gardens project to bring horticulture back into our lives and to feature and promote the beautiful gardens we still have and encourage people to create more. This could be set up to support mental, social and physical wellbeing and I am absolutely delighted that initiatives like this are underway in Peterborough and they can and I hope they will help people regain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the areas they live in.\nLower limits and speed enforcement\nWe need to address traffic and speed in the ward. Last time I asked 70 – 80% of people living on Dogsthorpe Road and Park Road wanted speeds reduced to 20mph to give us roads fit for children to walk and cycle to school on. That is why a few of us in Park Ward set up 20’s Plenty for Peterborough. These roads are currently treated as feeders to trunk routes and this has been disastrous for the area and has encouraged very high speeds and extremely dangerous driving.\nThe council is currently kicking 20’s Plenty campaigns in Peterborough into the long grass: the latest of these is a huge campaign in Werrington which is currently stalled at the council.\nPark Ward could use a big public meeting to tackle speeding in the wake of a series of incidents on Park Road, and continuing problems on nearly every road.\nCycle training for all\nWe need much higher standards of cycling training to improve cylist behaviour and safety. We should expect good behaviour between people, whatever they are riding or driving. I utterly deplore the council’s current obsessive focus on people who bike down Bridge Street while simultaneously doing absolutely nothing about declining standards of driving on the road. We need traffic enforcement, simply because there will always be some drivers who respond to nothing else.\nAll vehicles everywhere: not just a Bridge Street Bike Ban\nI observe cars with odd headlights missing, driving on pavements, ignoring signage prohibiting private cars on Westgate, ignoring give way signs and shoving out into traffic regardless, double parking outside schools, parking on pavements, parking close to corners, reversing out from a side street into a bigger road, driving with one hand on the wheel while eating, talking on a mobile phone or smoking or even all three. Not buckling your children up. Children standing in the footwell instead of being seated. Children sitting on adult’s laps. These things can and do kill. Why won’t the council tackle them? I’ve been told that traffic enforcement officers are now deployed over three counties: that means our police officers may not even be working at all within the whole of Cambridgeshire. Meanwhile PES staff catch and fine people on bicycles. It is shameful. If you come into Peterborough from somewhere else you are likely to be shocked and appalled by the driving standards you encounter here. This is a new phenomenon and everybody knows it doesn’t have to be like this.\nSafer streets\nI’d like initiatives to get children walking and bicycling to school and this has to start with changing parents’ perception of the hazards presented by our roads. Parents are right to worry: our roads are not safe. It would not be difficult or expensive to make them much safer.\nBringing democracy back\nI’d like our public gallery back in the council chamber. This has been closed since Conservative councillor Andy Coles was publicly shamed by demonstrators dropping a banner alleging human rights abuses. He is still a councillor, and since then two more women have come forward and made accusations about his behaviour while he worked as an undercover policeman.\nThat an ex spycop could be elevated to the unelected position of Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire (which includes Huntingdonshire) and Peterborough – a position which is set up to keep the police accountable to the people indicates how rotten things are in our county and what a parlous state local politics is in. He did resign from that position instantly, by the way, just not from his city councillor role.\nI will never bring you a counsel of despair\nI do not despair, though, like Charles Swift does. Apparently not alone he foresees the end of Peterborough City Council.\nIn the Greens we’ve never deluded ourselves that the systems of government which we have in place were fit for the tasks that lie ahead, especially if those include tackling the biggest single emergency which faces us: that of climate change.\nWe support grass roots movements which get on with it anyway, like Transition, for example. These initiatives do not rely on our corrupt electoral system to produce the necessary decisions. They just get on with it, and with politics as it is at the moment, that is the only attitude to have.\nWe’ve always deplored the slanging match of two party politcs. We like Open Space formats, for example, which create a circle and enable smaller but often much more important voices to be heard. We like proportional representation (rather than First Past the Post).\nThe Greens trust the people. This cannot be overstated. And because this is how we work, we have practical ideas which we ask you to consider and take away.\nWe are proposing to the people of the city that we parish Peterborough\nTo you: that we parish Park Ward, possibly creating three civil parishes within the current ward boundary.\nTo establish civil parishes across the area of the city which presently has none could help us all. I don’t think city councillors can cope with the level of need presented by escalating poverty and complex deprivation. A councillor doing a good job in this ward is having to work absolutely flat out tackling issues many of which could be better handled at a more local level. City councillors are struggling to raise their eyes above fly tip, potholes and dog mess. This is not the way to run a city the size of Peterborough. They’re not looking at housing or homelessness and when they try they find their hands are tied. They are not coping, and this has been engineered by successive decisions at a national level. As inequality increases under government after government, civil parishes could come to the rescue: they can tackle a great many of the things which currently burden our ward councillors and they could help us to get a working and accountable democracy back. If the city council does crash and burn, a civil parish (or three) could take up quite a few of its key functions and would be highly and very locally accountable to us.\nA competent parish council (this takes a year or two to achieve!) has available to it remedies and approaches available to it in the Localism Act as well as older powers already vested in parish councils.\nNOTES FOLLOWING COMMENTS & QUESTIONS RAISED\nGarden projects near Park Ward – where to start?\nPlease like on facebook: Creating Sustainable Places facebook.com/SustainablePECT\nThe Green Backyard facebook.com/thegreenbackyard\nOlive Branch Community Garden facebook.com/groups/olivebranchcommunitygarden\nIs this Peterborough’s only hustings?\nLocal Elections 2018 Hustings in Peterborough\nMon 26 Mar 2018 14:00 – 16:00 Peterborough Pensioners Association Hustings, Centre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nSun 15 Apr 2018 19:30 – 21:30 Park Ward Local Election Hustings, All Saints Church Hall, corner of All Saints Road & Park Road, Peterborough\nWed 25 Apr 2018 19:00 – 20:30 Fletton & Stanground Hustings, The Heron\nMON 30 Apr 2018 14:00 – 16:00\nPeterborough Pensioners Association Hustings\nCentre 68, (behind Westgate Church), Westgate, Peterborough\nCllr FITZGERALD, PEACH & ALLEN claim: Neighbourhood Councils are just as good\nNo: they’re not, though this is what several city councillors claim. They don’t have the same obligations to meet in public and to publish their minutes, so they are not as accountable. They also don’t have anything like the same powers as a proper PC.\nand that It is expensive to pay a parish clerk\nTrue, though split across every council tax payer who contributes a precept to help run the parish council, this might be very good value for money. With a good parish council and a good professional clerk, you can for example employ people who could supply nursing, policing or waste management services. You can build things, you can maintain things. And you can do that with very tight scrutiny, because locals are entitled to sit in on meetings.\nParish councillors are not paid. And a parish council can avoid many of the overheads which a city council can’t. Parish councils can work with, across and without party politics: they require local activists to work constructively together.\nSadly I don’t have the auditors reports anymore – but way back, around 2008, PCC was warned their financial policy of freezing council tax was putting their finances in jeopardy, but they carried on for several more years. Selling off assets, relying on Government grants the auditors told them would change. Doing deals with the football club and closing or “modernising” services. A word heavy with deceit in some circumstances.\nLikeLike",

To date he has not honoured me with a response.\nMonday 22 April 2024\nDear Paul Bristow,\nPension restitution for women born in the 1950s\nAlthough with the exception of The Right Honourable Sir Julian Lewis MP, Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, I note that you yourself and your fellow Conservative MPs have agreed – or been whipped – not to support EDM 243 https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/61723\nPlease can you explain why you are not supporting full pension restitution for a group of women, many of whose first parliamentary votes are likely to have been for Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to be elected Prime Minister and during whose first term, The United Kingdom signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1981 (later ratified in 1986).\nPERSONAL DETAILS PARA REMOVED\nI believe 50’s born women are owed full restitution.\nPERSONAL DETAILS SECTION REMOVED But it is my opinion that the UK workforce is less motivated and has less to look forward to by entering paid employment now than at any time in my life. You might like to have a word about what motivates people with the one person who has signed the EDM. With what was a presumably successful career in His Majesty’s armed forces, maybe he could give you a view on how a monstrous injustice followed by a huge breach of trust would impact morale in the services. I would be astonished if he and I could not agree on that.\nWill you reconsider your own and your party’s position, please?\nIt was close. After the Conservatives insisted on two recounts and then insisted on yet another check, the Park Ward result was finally agreed some time after three o’clock this morning. I got to bed at 4am. The full results for the Peterborough City Council elections are here. Votes for the first First Past The Post Police and Crime Commissioner election are still being counted.\nI am extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me and who supported me in this election. Everything you did means a lot. Thank you so very much.\nFor me, the campaign I was most concerned about was the one run by Kirsty Knight to retain her seat and I congratulate her very very warmly on achieving this despite having made a tough and gutsy decision to leave the Green Party just a few weeks prior to the election. Kirsty has almost certainly broken another election campaign record and she has certainly set an excellent precedent for Peterborough. Thank you everyone who has supported Kirsty.\nIt was noticeable to me that a couple of newbie Liberal Democrat candidates also won with remarkably short campaigns. Hats off to both of them too.\nI feel for Nick Sandford who has to continue to perform his duties as Mayor (until the Mayor making ceremony) despite losing his seat last night. I know he’ll see the funny side, but still. While Peterborough elects in thirds, surely, most years, the Mayor doesn’t have to be someone facing election in the same year? It is a very tough job.\nIncidentally, someone I respect very much had a quiet word in my ear last night. He pointed out that if your ward is represented by people who don’t live in it, the problem is not so much the non resident councillors, it is more likely to be that not enough ward residents are getting involved and putting themselves forward as candidates. Now, why is that?\nA succession of disappointing Conservative governments have left the UK with an extraordinary number of groups with very substantial grievances. One group consists of about 3,800,000 women who were born in the 50s.\nI was. Were you?\nIf not, you’ll know a few. Please support the campaign for full restitution to UK women born in the 1950’s. Please share this post and please join me. I have taken these two simple actions:\nJoin me and write to your MP Explain to your MP what this increase in pension age has meant to you. Check first whether or not your MP has already signed in support of EDM 243 The motion is “That this House welcomes the positive interventions from so many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have suffered pensions loss through the targeting of their pension rights; pays tribute to constituents and campaigners in their ongoing fight for justice; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory laws; and encourages the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to join mediation, noting there are no impediments to doing so.” If your MP hasn’t, please, when you write, ask your MP to sign EDM 24.\nNothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nAs if Voter ID wasn’t enough, this year brings a new voting complication\nVoters delivering their votes by hand to the Town Hall may be surprised this year by the notices stapled to the doors warning them NOT to post their ballots in the Town Hall letter box without a “return form”. This is a new rule! A new form! Nothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nThe government has added yet another risk to voting postally. There are others, including postal delivery delays (extremely big risk at the moment), rejection of ballot due to signature or date not being matched (very small risk in my opinion, but still a risk), mislaying the pack from the council, theft of the pack or the ballot paper from someone who is vulnerable, someone who is being bullied, or someone who doesn’t understand or care (very big risk indeed).\nIncidentally, it is forbidden for candidates to handle anyone else’s postal packs or ballots. They should only ever handle their own. If a candidate or anyone you don’t trust completely offers to take your vote for you, please report it. You might be experiencing a crime and the council will check it out for you.\nStinky poo in UK rivers is one thing.

March was the eleventh consecutive month in which global sea and air temperatures broke records.\nWhy does voting independent in Park Ward makes sense this year? Because what I said in my address to voters last year remains true this year: Park Ward has exactly the same problems. But this year we have even more challenges and we need to start by describing them honestly.\nLast year I wrote a long Address To Voters. I also leafletted the whole ward and door knocked a lot of residents. This year I left the Green Party and am standing now to represent Park Ward as an independent candidate. This shift has been no fun. It has sapped my energy and represents a huge change for me.\nI undertook a bin lid project while I leafletted last year. Missing lids are responsible for unsecured litter which escapes the bin to fly about in high winds. I emailed the council listing each bin in need of a new lid. These jobs were eventually completed in late July: they were delayed because the council couldn’t get hold of the replacement parts. If you spot a bin lid which needs replacing you can check whether one has already been requested, and if not, notify the council on Fix My Street. You can ask on behalf of any house: lots of residents don’t or can’t contact the council themselves.\nBig Bins – outside flats and shops\nThis year I was planning to undertake a similar project, focussing instead on the big ugly bins outside shops and flats. Overflowing monster bins are one of the most depressing features of this part of Peterborough. So far I have established that most commercial services don’t include garden, compost, or recycling options even for paper and glass. If you have suggestions or if you’re interested in this project, please drop me a line.\nHealth & Education services struggle with residents who move\nPark Ward is home to very high numbers of very temporary residents, many of whom have escaped disasters abroad to settle and prosper here. Many quickly move out of Park Ward, finding opportunities matching their skills or a home elsewhere.\nShort term rentals and bad landlords create precarious housing conditions for renters. This means that children are forced to move from school to school. This unsettles everyone and is bad for school and family life and the instability risks damaging children’s development.\nUnfortunately, our so called “National” Health Service doesn’t have a “national” patient database. Instead, each contracted dentist or doctor must register each patient all over again from scratch whenever they move. This takes time and is a huge administrative overhead for local health services and it is not even fully funded. This hit leaves services at the departure end of a relocating patient’s journey with demotivated staff and less money to spend on the core medical side.\nA similar problem affects university students who fall off dentists’ NHS lists when away studying. This list scraping will carry on until the NHS offers dentists a new care centred contract which is acceptable to dentists. Dentists just want to be treated like professionally trained human beings responsible for looking after people’s needs rather than like animated cost centres robotically triggering payouts from long lists of budget headings.\nSome children who can’t be added to dentists’ NHS lists (because the dentist doesn’t have a new contract yet) are ending up in hospital needing emergency treatments for excruciatingly painful conditions which could have been prevented entirely had they been caught earlier.\nSome politicians will tell you there aren’t enough dentists, nurses and doctors in the UK, and that this is the problem in the NHS. It isn’t true. There are plenty. It is rather that trained professionals don’t want to work in a system which can’t support them properly (eg forces excessive working hours on them or puts them in understaffed and therefore unsafe conditions) and won’t even pay them properly. Please don’t let politicians get away with fibs: please ask them about this if you get the chance. And VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD\nResources for Roads\nYou can quickly guess how broke a council is by simply driving along its roads. You can spot the administrative borders between different councils on a very long drive: one council is managing, then a long series of potholes indicate that you have reached the next, which has clearly had to give up. Some Peterborough city centre road surfaces look as if they’ve been bombed and many roads in the UK are so badly neglected that they are causing serious damage to vehicles. Pavements are even worse, not least because so many cars drive on them (pavements are not built for cars). This may constitute “growth” in our insane economic system. But it is not clever. Just because someone can make a profit out of a problem (arguably, insurance), it doesn’t mean that government should go along with the problem. Shameless politicians are asking the electorate to choose between spending to care for people who need social care and maintaining our infrastructure, as if there was a choice. As if it neglect of one were, in fact, an option. Please don’t let them get away with this. VOTE INDEPENDENT IN PARK WARD.\nThis year I am standing as an independent candidate in Peterborough\nPolice and Crime Commissioner, Peterborough City Council and several parish council elections will be held on Thursday 2nd May. But this time, I am standing in Park Ward as an independent politician. This means that I can set my own campaign priorities and ignore group think and party lines. If elected, I would be free to vote only for those policies and decisions which would improve the lives of my constituents and which I personally agreed with.\nI supported Councillor Kirsty Knight’s successful Green Party campaigns last year. This year she is fighting to retain her seat for the first time as an independent councillor. This takes great courage and I respect her hugely for her decision. I endorse, am supporting, and will continue to support Kirsty after what I very much hope will be another victory and another campaign first. Please vote for and support Kirsty, who in her first term has already established herself as an outstanding city councillor.\nCollette Francis (who campaigned energetically for the Bretton Oak Tree and joined the Greens) is also standing in West as an independent candidate. As a serving parish councillor interested and competent in paperwork and planning, I am confident Collette will make a superb city councillor. Please vote for and support Collette.\nLastly, thank you to all those who have helped and tried to help during the past few months. I have heard every word and I appreciate all you have done and said. Thank you.\nPlease get in touch to support my campaigns, or those of Collette or Kirsty\nWho is observing, and who is maybe not even noticing the visible and costly effects of climate change in Peterborough? A clue might have landed on your doormat.\nI walked through Central Park recently and realised that nearly every single box had died. I took a couple of photos intending to write to the council and promptly forgot.\nThen, thanks to Angus Ellis I received a useful reminder. Thank you, Angus.\nThe reminder arrived in the form of a Labour and Co-operative Party leaflet suggesting I vote for Angus who is this party’s candidate in Park Ward. It dropped on my doormat and I eventually got round to reading it. I discovered a very rare picture of Park Ward Councillor Mohammed Samir (who, along with another Ravensthorpe councillor is not profligate with his words or his image) at the bottom right of page three. And even more surprising, there, in front of his frown and rising up the bank behind him is scorched, brown and dead or dying box hedging, telling every sharp eyed reader in Park Ward the very sad story about its own highly likely extinction.\nWeather conditions are increasingly brutal and this pattern of intemperate weather (part of our new, not so temperate climate) is particularly cruel to box, a key evergreen parks and gardens hedging plant. Long periods of extreme drought alternating with non stop record rainfall will have stressed this along with many other plants, including many of Central Park’s trees.\nSlowly, since 2007 when it was first recorded in the UK, the box moth has been travelling north (it began its very long journey somewhere in South East Asia!) and here it is: rampaging across Peterborough. It noticed it in my garden only last summer. It probably reached the park before that.\nI wrote to the council this morning to ask that the dead box bushes are dug out. A very sad job for those who tended them. It used to be good gardening practice to burn diseased and infested plants. These days, hot composting (we have brown garden bins for that in Peterborough) will probably do the job of disinfection.\nI have also been thinking about what needs doing in Central Park to deal with the loss of the lovely robust evergreen structure which the box has provided for many years around Central Park’s beds and along paths. Evergreens are particularly important in winter, when so many plants are bare.\nReplacement structural evergreen hedging can’t be planted safely in Spring or Summer (October is the very earliest sensible time) and until then at the earliest, removing dead plants will open the beds up to unwanted foot traffic: both pet and human.\nFast growing decorative annual flowers might have time to provide protective ground cover until a decision is made on whether and how to replace.\nI would be very surprised if there is one plant which could do what the extraordinary and now at risk box did for all the park’s flower beds, since the conditions in each bed are increasingly varied: some are very very dry (memorial gardens) and others around the outer path are shady and one or two occasionally waterlogged. Decisions could be complicated.\nSeeding with forget-me-not (on damper beds) and/or nasturtium (round the top of the dry memorial garden).\nAnd if a decision is made to retain hedge type edging, which plants might work well in the various conditions to be found in different beds around the park?\nI think that rosemary might work around the memorial garden. It doesn’t mind neglect and drought and responds to drought by flowering (all year round!!) if dry. It doesn’t mind being on a bank which will lose rainwater. It can be clipped (min twice a year) into a very beautiful and sturdy box type hedge. But it probably shouldn’t go in straight away: there will be too much box moth around and it’s definitely a second choice target!",

As I wrote another story was breaking: the one about the car which killed two men walking along a local road. You know as a story breaks when it will be big, especially when there is briefcase involved, with a huge amount of cash in it and the next thing it was all over our television screens. But let’s ignore the big police blokes chasing big naughty blokes story and look at the underlying story. The one about the road. Because this location caused actual cries of pain on social media.\nI received one comment (not on my blog, unfortunately): “Until the Highways Authority and their Highways Engineers face prosecution for corporate manslaughter for failing to address the obvious risk of death in circumstances such as these, nothing will change. Presently, they can, [and do], pretend to the fiction there is no risk until someone gets killed. As it is, the chances of anyone in the highways department accepting any personal or corporate responsibility are about the same as those that you will be bitten by a daffodil.”\nHe was just addressing the deaths of the two men, possibly not even having read the two year old story about another death. But he would presumably argue that there would have been an equally good case for prosecution then: two years ago. If he is right, then what is the strength of that case now that two more deaths have occurred? Surely, overwhelming.\nThe Peterborough judiciary has managed to jail Philippa. Think about it.\nWhich begs the question of who could be prosecuted.\nAnother friend blamed Peterborough City Council. I’d assumed when I wrote my last post that this patch of road was outside the city council boundary, and I was just about to correct him. But I thought I’d check my facts first. And this is what I found. The white patch is Peterborough Unitary Authority’s area. The orange bit is in Huntingdonshire and it looks as if the accident happened on the patch of road which runs along the boundary. Both orange and white patches sit within the constituency of North West Cambridgeshire.\nI will of course (somewhat unusually!) be sharing this particular post with the police.\nMeanwhile, the only person in a position to bang the appropriate heads together, it seems to me, is Shaliesh Vara MP. He does not make himself available to me via social media (for me that means that he doesn’t do twitter) and I’m not in his constituency, so I’m not entitled to talk to him. So I won’t be sharing this post with him: I can’t. You might like to do that.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_author_fionaradic_page_11/content_752.html": "The best thing I’ve read on the EU Referendum to date.\nI have been wrestling with how I am going to vote in the Euro referendum. I feel the Green Party of England and Wales rather rushed into supporting the “in” camp. It was decided by a single “emergency” motion at the conference in Bournemouth – well before Cameron had come up with his half-baked deal with Europe and a referendum date.\nTo me this was not the way the Green Party should have done this. An online ballot of all members would have been more suitable. It may well have reached the same outcome, but at least more people would have had a say.\nBut regardless of this conference “decision”, the Green Party is sensible enough not to force its members to speak with one voice and to tolerate those – like Jenny Jones and Rupert Read – who go against the party line on this.\nSo where do I…\nView original post 1,694 more words\nDear residents of Fletton & Stanground ward\nI write a week after polling day in order to thank you for your votes.\nThe voters in Fletton & Stanground voted thus:\n*Clark LAB 627\nFisher CON 434\n*Lillis LD 722\nMonk UKIP 623\nOsaman CON 384\nRadic GRN 237\nSlinger IND 261\nM Thulbourn LAB 529\nN Thulbourn LAB 522\n*Whitby UKIP 691\nWilliamson CON 406\nI can’t pretend I am not disappointed at coming last, but I am not surprised and I am happy to deprive the delightful Peter Slinger of last place!\nI’ve provided more detail here.\nI thought I’d share a couple of thoughts. The first is about “counting agents”. There was a recount for Fletton & Stanground called by UKIP, who were only three votes away from winning third place. The recount took ages: I think about an hour. It eventually identified one error which awarded the Labour candidate one extra vote, leaving the UKIP candidate in fourth place, this time with a four vote gap. The grass skirt method of counting votes can easily produce a discrepancy. The grass skirt is the name given to a set of overlapping ballot papers which are stuck down using a large piece of paper laid below them, with a sticky “waist band”. The result is a large array of sheets which look almost as if they have been pleated. It is the method used for counting votes for multiple vacancy elections. There are two obvious moments for error. The counter can get the row total wrong. Some were using rulers. Others weren’t. And there is a moment when the whole grass skirt is taken away to a pile on a table in the centre of the room for data input, creating room for data input errors which can’t be scrutinised. Putting sets of results into a laptop is not something which happens with the normal voting system: where votes for one candidate are put into that candidate’s box. In the single vacancy system the counting agent can literally check that the papers come out of the ballot box, that they haven’t gone astray (e.g. fallen off a table) and that they are placed in the right box. Counters are working in the middle of the night and performing a task which is unbelievably slow with a lot of waiting around. It is very very easy to slip up, but with counting agents watching and intervening if a mistake happens, the risks of accidental or even deliberate miscounting (which would be an electoral offence!) are minimised.\nAnother thought wasn’t mine: it was that of the winning candidate’s partner. She remarked to me that Fletton & Stanground ward “wasn’t Green” because “people didn’t visit the Green Backyard”. I didn’t respond to her there and then (I’m not very articulate on election night and I am still pretty exhausted as I write this) but I felt hers might be an all too perceptive comment. People do visit the Green Backyard: a lot of people visit it. But maybe not that many from the area of the Fletton & Stanground ward? The Green Backyard is very much within the “inner city”, but the outer edges of Stanground, way beyond the parkway, are very rural indeed: green in many other ways. Until this year The Green Backyard was in the old Fletton & Woodston ward and I would say that it has established very strong associations with that area, and also with the embankment and with the city centre: it has become part of the Peterborough tourist’s trail. It is perfectly possible that Stanground village and surrounding area are not as well connected to the Green Backyard which now lies on the furthest western edge of the new ward. The Green Backyard has immense potential to act as a ecological and green project incubator for the city as a whole.\nIn fact, one of the reasons why I stood in this ward, was that it and its immediate neighbours have been subject to the most extraordinary boundary changes and as someone who knows and is very fond of Fletton, I am frankly concerned that Fletton has been divided into three. Dividing places is one way of conquering them, or of diluting their character and individuality. I mentioned this at the Fletton & Stanground hustings during the election period and at that I raised the possibility of creating a parish council in Stanground and, perhaps another in Fletton. Someone in the audience shot this idea down and the conversation was over before it had properly begun. I didn’t quite catch what she said, but I think it was to the effect that Church Street would never talk to South Street. On reflection, she must have been joking: if I caught her remark correctly, these streets run into one another: they are the same street.\nIf anyone wants to continue this conversation about parishing the areas of Peterborough which currently don’t have parish councils, here, I’d be delighted. This is a very big project and even if we could find enough support and practical help to see it through, it could take years.\nAttended\nJohn Peach CON\nBeki Sellick LD\nMohammad Yousaf CON\nAli Shan GREEN\nAbsent but sent apologies\nRichard Ferris LAB\nArfan Khan CON\nJohn Shearman LAB\nGraham Whitehead UKIP\nAbsent and no apology received (or read out)\nSabra Yasin LAB\nThis account is a transcription of my notes, intended solely for me and makes no pretensions to completeness.

Had organised the slate of 29 UKIP candidates this year. A long & (I thought) well written (compared to last year’s) statement was read out.\nYesterday, inspired by comments about walking by Ch Ali Shan, I smashed a personal best (PB). I completed a hyper leaflet drop. I knew it would be tough, so I decided to use a smart phone app called mapmywalk.\nI was thinking I could picture my leaflet drop to produce something shareable with the team (we’d just broken all our leafletting records over the weekend) and that this would be fun for me on a tough day and we might end up with something we could all use. I don’t go nuts for personal performances or PBs (well, not usually!) but the mapping bit could turn out to be extremely useful. But I’d already set off, before deciding to give it a go and downloaded the app on the go. (I wouldn’t do that usually.) So I began with an inaccuracy: a bit of real walk not covered by the walk being built by the app.\nDoing this properly, you’d have to decide: what is the start of the drop: where you start delivering, or your home?\nAs I went, I found good things to snap:\nAnd you can’t go anywhere in Peterborough now without finding ghastly things on pavements. The stuff we can’t live with and before it has done a job is no longer worth the cost of disposal to people who value what cash they can get. I now report there and then, using: FixMyStreet, which has much more functionality than MyPeterborough which, despite being a very poor and unresponsive (i.e. the app developers don’t respond to user queries) app, is the only one listed on the council’s website. Here are some of the horrible things walkers come across every day in Peterborough:\nYou can pause the “walk” on the app and resume, so as keep the walk part look like an actual walk and the stop and do things or chat to people not look like part of the “walk”. If it were possible to do this correctly, the app would give you an accurate average speed for when you were really walking. It sounds easy, but every time I did something like reporting a discarded pct and then the mouldy chair without remembering to pause the app each time, there would be an impact on my “walk’s” average speed and my results would get less and less true.\nIn fact, yesterday, I think as I pressed resume, just after the mouldy chair by the bus stop and the public toilets which have been closed for over a decade, I lifted my head, ready to go and a massive training lorry swung swung into a small tree in front of my eyes. There are moments when apps are not even in your consciousness.\nBut once or twice I also forgot to resume until I was several hundred yards from where I’d stopped. This error is funny because the app creates something which looks like a flight path on the “walk”. When I did this and turned a corner, the app would draw a flight path straight through a house. And when I stopped in The Crown for a coffee (yes, they do), the app stayed there long after I’d set off again, sat and maybe dozing in front of the fire, improving my average as I walked on and on without using any time, and waiting for another short flight.\nI wonder if a pedometer rather than a route mapper would have worked better for me, or maybe one which does both? Because unless you are delivering to homes with very long driveways, the app doesn’t see the little sideways ducks and dives from the pavement to the letterboxes. That is OK if what you are mapping is an ordinary walk. But a leaflet drop is something else.\nPeople look down on leafletting or assume (sometimes at their peril) that it is easy. In fact it isn’t easy: it is very physical and the best footwear would probably be cross trainers. It isn’t just the walking: it is the sharp turns round gates, bending down to letterboxes, some of them at ground level. Leafletting certainly gives your whole body a workout. This is why councillors ask people to help them deliver and promise them they can shrink their waistlines. This promise is actually true. It is also hard on the knees, because if you walk fast your body needs to change direction fast.Which app best describes this sort of activity?\nAs for today, I might write a bit and check on my seedlings or if my legs can cope, I might pop down to the Real Nappy Library, who are doing their bit to reduce landfilled nappies in Central Park today till 2pm.\nThe forecast was dire: rain and low temperatures. And a massive black cloud did come along and snowed on us and one very delighted little girl. Hail followed. But we stayed warm (oddly, it wasn’t all that cold). And we kept posting leaflets into letterboxes. But it was one of those days when focussing on broken bins and flytipped furniture and electrics was particularly difficult. The ghastly truth is that people (including me) get used to rubbish in their environment and we literally have no choice but to keep moving: to pass it by. We’d never do anything if we dealt with every bit. But sometimes the weather and the lovely stuff steals the show and that is what this afternoon was like. So here’s a photo narrative. The moon was in at least three photos, but now I can only find it in one. I stumbled on a beautiful red camellia in full flower in a south facing garden and some pelargoniums: they looked a bit dry but warm and also in full bloom but I didn’t photograph them.\nThe full text reads as follows:\n”\n|\nEXTRAORDINARY COUNCIL |\nAGENDA ITEM No. 3 |\n|\n13 APRIL 2016 |\nPUBLIC REPORT |\nMOTIONS ON NOTICE\nThe following notice of motion has been received in accordance with the Council’s Standing Order 13.1:\n1.

Sit them down after they’ve had a good meal and read it as gently and softly as you can. Just before bed with the lights down. Don’t forget right at the end of this absolutely terrible story, to remind them that they are not allowed to vote for a change of government until they turn 18. But they can register to vote to change matters they disapprove of as soon as they turn 17.\nYour children might react by telling you not to be so silly, close their eyes and sleep, much as so often happens when you read one of the ghastliest and grimmest of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nBut if they sit up and protest against your bedtime story, here is how to suggest that they run a poll at their school. Younger doubters may ask for another story: this can’t after all, be how it all ends? Maybe an Adventure is in order? Or a Game? Tomorrow night, then.\nChildren can always run a Poll\nAt their School, Club in the Family or anywhere where there are three or more people who can be persuaded to join in. They will need to appoint an Electoral Returning Officer to run a Poll or even an Internal Election. A boring school would appoint a teacher to this role. But this would avoid about two weeks work for a whole school who could Research, Discuss, Decide and Vote on making their own Elected Officer or Appointment (could be either) from within the class (for a class poll) or a school (for a school wide poll). They’d also need to Decide (and how to do that) whether or not they can Vote in an Assembly (like Parliament) or whether they need a full scale Election, in which case they would need to Design and Manufacture their own Poll Cards, Ballot Boxes and Confidential Polling Booths, Specify the Dates and Times the Booths would be open and then Decide how to Organise the Count: Appoint Polling Staff, Appoint Counting Staff. They’d also have to Decide on the Definition of the Electorate (or determine an Electoral Boundary) and whether or not they need to Register Eligible Voters on an Electoral Register. Oh yes, they’d have to Decide on a Wording to be put on the Ballot and whether or not more than one Vote can be taken and if so, how. And whether or not a Simple Majority is the best Voting Strategy.\nThey could each run a Vote Count to find out who or what Motion has won the Poll. Offences Detected and Offences Not Detected could also be counted, by each of the smaller teams.\nTo make this slightly less deadly (nobody is pretending all this is super exciting!) for older and very bright students, maybe those with lively imaginations and career options including Crime Writer, you could have one small additional group working in a Vote Fraud Team (their Objective could be to Manipulate the Vote by whatever Illegal Means they can Concoct) and another small additional group working as an Electoral Police, working to Detect Electoral Offences. This is not recommended for children under the age of 14, who generally adhere to the Right and Wrong Theory of Everything.\nParticipants who don’t understand the Capitalised Words (there are even a couple in this Post’s Heading!) will find them Defined in Wikipedia.\nCould two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nWell, Arguably they could. Because a teacher who asks a class to Vote FOR or AGAINST an idea by asking for a Show of Hands can run a Poll in about forty seconds flat. Although, of course, that hyper efficient teacher’s class may never grasp the finer points of how elections are run (and policed) by UK governments and UK law enforcement.\nSurely Santa is self employed and could apply for a different type of visa? But if he hasn’t done it yet then Christmas will be delayed until at least early March before his visa is granted!

The motion read “With hundreds of people having signed up to a petition to support to introduce a cycle lane along Bridge Street, and given the Council Leader’s clear concerns regarding potential safety issues from a minority of cyclists, this Council recommends that the Cabinet introduce a bespoke cycle lane along this stretch from Cathedral Square to the junction with Bourges Boulevard.” (Agenda, p96)\nCouncillor Fox stood up and said that he was a long standing Cycling Touring Club member but that he got off and walked in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Swift said he had been cycling for over 75 years. To interjections he confirmed that yes, he was still riding the same bicycle. And that he thought that the council should ban cycling from the top of Cowgate to the end of Long Causeway [ie to extend to double its length the current Bridge Street ban].\nCouncil Leader, Councillor Cereste said “I agree Madam Mayor. We are an environment city. We provide cycle ways. Let’s be reasonable. In the city centre it just doesn’t work. A few walks is good for cyclists. A few days ago a cyclist was coming down Bridge Street past the town hall. He didn’t care about anybody – past coffee bars – past people. I had to drag my little boy out from in front of him. Another occasion: a small white haired lady she nearly spun on his air. [?] He didn’t get across Bourges Boulevard: he couldn’t stop, he spun round the lady on his bike. Majority are nice sensible people. Bridge Street isn’t safe to enjoy. As much as I have great sympathy for cyclists – if I had my way it would be the entire city centre.\nCouncillor Miners said Peterborough has a population of 180,000 and the petition was signed by very small numbers. That cyclists were terrorising pedestrians. That it wasn’t about having a designated cycle lane in Bridge Street.\nCouncillor North said it was nonsense.\nCouncillor McKean said it was not really practical. That we are encouraging young families into pedestrianised zones. And the blind and partially sighted. And that Councillor Fower should take the Data Act into account when telling us who said what on his petition.\nCouncillor Over said lets move to a vote.\nCouncillor Sharp said he’d discovered the location of Narnia. It was two rows in front of him. Where Councillor Fower sat. That he was a Health and Safety officer and it worried him just reading it. He’d spent five minutes reading it. And for the first minute he just laughed.\nCouncillor Fitzgerald said that Councillor Fower had mentioned Cambridge in his opening address. But he’d heard a story about a doctor and a five year old injured mixing cyclists and pedestrians. He’d ban cycling in all pedestrian areas. The cycle route is Wentworth Street. He would ask the leader to use the budget to yank everybody off a cycle. That Councillor Fower was using social media. It is an accident waiting to happen. And that his own wife had been injured in a collision with a cyclist.\nCouncillor Ash said he wasn’t convinced that cyclists would adhere to it. The other end of Bridge Street permitted cyclists outside the Magistrates Court. They don’t always stay on the side they are supposed to. We see it everyday. People wandering from shop to shop.\nCouncillor Martin said he was a cyclist and he wanted a cycle route adjacent to or parallel to Bridge Street.\nCouncillor Goodwin said “Thank you. The city centre is part of my portfolio. Thank you for your common sense. The speeds that some people go through is an accident waiting to happen.”\nCouncillor Sandford, seconding the motion responded. “I’d like the press and the public to take notice. The intention of this council is to ban cycling. We have the largest network of cycleways. But they are disjointed at the city centre, especially Bridge Street [where cycling is banned Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm]. We are proposing a cycle lane to segregate cyclists from pedestrians.\nCouncillor Fox said they can’t mix if cyclists are on their bikes. That Councillor Cereste is talking about abuses which happen. The current system isn’t working. It is confusing. That Councillor Cereste was actually sat with a policeman trying to stop people from cycling. Why not have a review? That would be better than extremist policies prohibiting cycling completely.\nCouncillor Fower listed people who were in support of a cycle lane and cited someone called Mike George who had claimed that the current ban was not policed effectively. And that the motion proposed a common sense solution to a self created problem.\nCouncillor Cereste raised a point of information. This was that the motion was not common sense. That if we put a cycle lane from the top of Bridge Street to the crossing at TK Maxx people would cross and go from one shop to another while on the cycle lane people would be doing 20 to 30mph. It is just daft.\nCouncillor Sandford requested enforcement of standing orders, if we couldn’t have enforcement of the cycling ban, since Councillor Cereste’s point was not a point of information at all. He hinted that the interim legal officer (the regular one was unable to attend) didn’t have the experience to cope with enforcing procedures.\nCouncillor Cereste said he’d corrected Councillor Sandford on common sense.\nThe legal officer said he’d been doing this job for 25 years, just not for Peterborough.\nFour people voted in favour, everyone else against, except Councillor Ed Murphy, who abstained.\nI despair at the level of ill-informedness and lack of vision displayed by our esteemed local representatives. What is that they do not understand from the experience of a growing number of UK towns and cities and the considerable weight of real evidence from the continent where vibrant, pleasant, safe, often car-free, shared-use cities and town centres are the norm? The levels of cycling are tens of times more than in Peterborough and there is not a problem about pedestrian and cyclist conflict. The aged, Peterborough cycle route ‘network’ is incomplete and much of it is sub-standard, often causing more problems and safety issues than it seeks to overcome. We then wonder why cyclists often don’t use these ‘facilities’. Similarly, those fortunate enough to have cars, continue to use them and kill and seriously injure pedestrians and cyclists in and around this pro-car environment that is Peterborough. How many pedestrians are killed or seriously injured by cyclists? I believe that the facts are that more cyclists are killed or injured avoiding cyclists who step out in front of them when they are cycling on the roads! I am a car owner and I am not anti-car, there’s just a time and a place for the car. More cycling = safer cycling. The sooner that Peterborough politicians work this out, the better will be our city and the health and well-being of its citizens.\nLikeLike\nGood comments and I agree that cycling should be encouraged i.e. people should use bicycles more, rather than relying on cars.\nHowever, there is conflict between cyclists and pedestrians and it needs to be managed and prevented. My comments are based largely on what I have seen in London. Perhaps there are towns or cities elsewhere in the UK that have good arrangements for cycle lanes – I have not seen any.\nA lot of the conflict is due to (as Rob mentions) sub-standard cycle lanes. If you go to a European city such as Munich you see cycle lanes which are dedicated to cyclists, they are wide and have clear boundaries and proper signage (warnings to pedestrians etc.) and they are largely continuous except at road intersections.\nIn the UK so-called cycle lanes are often created by simply painting white lines on portions of existing roads for motor vehicles, with no boundary or barrier. They tend to be very narrow, only wide enough for one cycle. The cycle lanes are discontinuous. Cyclists using them are forced to exit them to travel in the same lanes as motor vehicles or on the pavement with pedestrians. This is unacceptable and dangerous. It is not surprising that cyclists often choose to either travel along with motor vehicles or wholly on the pavement.\nThere will always be a proportion of cyclists who ride irresponsibly. However, good design of cycle lanes would reduce the harmful consequences.\nMark Harris\nLikeLike\nI think that cyclists should be prevented from cycling in towns and cities in areas intended for people to walk in such as car-free pedestrian precincts and pavements. That is how it used to be.\nCycle lanes are often badly located and they often intersect pedestrian walkways. Cyclists are often abusive to pedestrians and cycle in an unsafe way (the less competent riders tending to ride on the pavement). Collisions occur between cyclists and pedestrians. Cyclists do not care much for the needs of pedestrians and see them as a nuisance. Surely pedestrians should have right of way over cyclists in a pedestrian area.\nIt is true that cyclists sometimes collide with motor vehicles on roads, but that is irrelevant in pedestrian zones. In any case, directing cyclists to cycle among pedestrians is not a solution, it is a very bad idea.\nMark Harris\nLikeLike",

(It was one of two city centre roads which require moving to the wrong side of the roads and was a top local knowledge quiz question.) It was used by cyclists to EXIT Long Causeway onto Broadway. During recent new surfacing work, inexplicably the old route has been blocked off by a new bit of fence.\nLong Causeway is one way for vehicles but two way for cyclists.\nNo entry signs at the EXIT of Long Causeway don’t make sense, even to car drivers, who wouldn’t see them, if they were driving in the right direction. The road is one way for cars, (isn’t it?) which would be coming towards you in this picture. The only vehicular exit is via Cathedral Square. Which is behind you.\nOnly council permitted vehicles are allowed in past the rising bollards. Although they are not currently working, it looks as if a new monitor has been installed.\nAn exit is required onto Broadway for cyclists. At the moment cyclists are cycling straight past the completely pointless no entry sign and over the potentially rising bollards.\nIs the council planning to\n- reinstate the previous cycle route and remove the fence? This would separate cars from bikes and leave a favourite quiz question intact.\n- remove the no entry signs?\n- add a cycling contraflow sign (as at the roundabout end of Cowgate)? But if it is going to do this will it explain how it intends to ensure cyclists aren’t accidentally impaled on a rising bollard they haven’t noticed?\nWe did have a Council Leader who wanted to abolish cycling in the whole city centre. He lost his seat in May.\nWhile he is gone, I for one am hoping the Council will be able to resolve this particular road sign nonsense quickly, sensibly and constructively. And if whoever is responsible for traffic signs in the city wants to comment below, he or she is very welcome.\nThere is hope. The view in the other direction makes a little bit more sense, (except for the temporary signage).",

Motion from Councillor Ferris, Councillor Fower, Councillor Johnson, Councillor Knowles, Councillor Murphy, Councillor Sandford and Councillor Shaheed\nCouncil notes the announcement by the Chancellor of a devolution deal for the East in his Budget on 16 March; but regrets that the deal, in its current form, is not acceptable to this Council.\nCouncil requests that the Chief Executive write to the Secretary of State for Local Government to bring this resolution to his attention.\nThe proposed East Anglia Devolution Agreement can be found at the following link:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508115/The _East_Anglia_Devolution_Agreement_FINAL_with_signatures_and_logos.pdf\nA hard copy of the document will be available in each Group Room.”\nBut this was not debated.

It thus becoming the substantive motion and the only item which could be voted on. This removed any opportunity to discuss the original motion. It also positioned the council as unhappy, but wishing to remain in the conversation. At least one councillor believes that the city would have been excluded from discussions on the “proposed East Anglia Devolution Agreement” #ToryDevolution #EasternPowerhouse or what I think it is: #PseudoDevolution had it voted FOR the Ferris Motion.\nA very similar episode took place on 29th February at South Kesteven. I proposed a motion with the aim of discussing public services and privatisation. The Conservative Leader of the Council produced an ‘amended motion’ which was “delete all text and replace with…” changing the theme beyond all recognition. There followed a lot of filibustering including accusations that it was my intention to discredit Council Officers before the whole thing was thrown out in confusion.\nIt is one thing to lose a debate based on reasoned, grown up, arguments.

Shares also help!\nHenry Penn Walk collapse a third update\nI had a useful exchange of information with the journalist since my second update. They’ve got through to the council and have been told the council is now going after “GKL”. I thought I’d established that they built the building and, presumably the embankment which has subsequently collapsed. The journalist were now being told that this entity is the property manager (which took me completely by surprise). So, RHRL is out of the picture, just for the moment. Which is interesting because as of a couple of days ago, the council’s press office were saying they were going after/in dispute/had settled with RHRL. Weren’t they? Isn’t it the name in the local paper, linked in my second update? Now why would the council’s press office have been saying that if it wasn’t true? Please note that my first assumption is absolutely not that the press office has “made a genuine error” (as claimed by Cllr Fitzgerald over the entirely unrelated cheque gate affair. But that is a whole other scandal.)\nCould this mean that the council is now chasing after a relevant, genuinely responsible entity and that maybe flat owners will not be held liable for the repairs? If so, there is hope.\nNew morning. New search. Google search immediately produces possibly irrelevant\nand, likely more relevant, GKL BUILDING & CIVIL ENGINEERING LTD\nCompany number 07272683\nhttps://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07272683/filing-history?page=1\nTwo directors with significant influence or control.\nMr James Andrew Brackenbury ACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthAugust 1977NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlHas significant influence or control\nWho has a B Eng in Civil Engineering from Nottingham Trent.\nand\nMr Eamonn Michael Killoughery ACTIVE\nCorrespondence addressUnit 2, Varity Park, Vicarage Farm Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, PE1 5GU Notified on6 April 2016Date of birthMay 1962NationalityBritishCountry of residenceEnglandNature of controlOwnership of shares – 75% or moreOwnership of voting rights – 75% or moreRight to appoint and remove directors\nwho is a big cheese in corporate director land, worthy of the translation of his skills and business interests into Russian.\nand 28 other companies. Including GKL DEVELOPMENTS (UK) LTD, Company number 05599784. So what we have is a large multi sector group of companies, with activities including waste disposal, road construction, property development and management.\nThe story that the developer went broke looks unconvincing, at first glance, anyway. And anyway, thinking about it, where did that story come from? And why am I aerated about the issue? Oh yes, of course: Facebook.\nI’m not sure why Cllr Fitzgerald is still blocking me. Maybe he’s still cross about the starring role he played in my top post of all time?\nSo there we were about midday Friday 20th January. I came back to finish this early this morning.\nHenry Penn Walk collapse a second update\nSince my first update on the collapse, the press got excited and phone calls were made. And someone in the council appears to have woken up and done some digging into its own documents. Check the date in the top right corner! This is a 1996 document which was uploaded just a few days ago. Click the image for the council’s webpage.\nThe Cambridge News published some of what I said along with a photo .\nPeterborough Telegraph believes the financial burden will fall upon the tenants of the block. I believe that this would be profoundly wrong and I will set out why in this second update.\nAnother journalist called & gave me a missing part of the jigsaw puzzle. So I’ve now been able to find things I didn’t previously know were missing.\nAs a result of this, I’d like to ask the following questions of the council:\nWhy is your press office advising the press that the council is in dispute with “a developer”, RFHL Riverview House Freehold Limited?\nWhy are investigators unable to locate or contact RFHL, if it still exists?\nAre you able to put investigators in touch with RFHL’s legal team, please?\nDo you agree\nthat RFHL is not and never was a developer? That it is – or was – arguably something resembling a residents’ association, with no legal liabilities or assets?\nthat the approved planning application according to which the block was to be constructed is 96/00001/FUL | Validated: Mon 07 Oct 1996 | Status: Decided\nDo you agree that the building was constructed by a large and very much alive Peterborough construction company, called GKL Group?\nCan you advise its company number, please? (A pertinent GKL Group is not listed at Companies House with these initials.)\nBut with or without a company number, the company’s Facebook account acknowledges it was the builder & is proud of a picture showing the building and Henry Penn path.\nDo you agree that a building such as this will have required Building Control Approval? I am sure you do. And do you agree that this building had no Building Control problems and was passed as compliant with whatever was required of it between its plot completion date 28th March 2007 and decision date 4th April 2007?\nExcellent. So let us examine the building control documents, then. Does it concern you that the commencement date as far as building control is concerned, is “Not Available”?\nNext, can you confirm that all issues relating to ownership of the whole site, including the part of the river which was proposed to be built out into was conveyed satisfactorily to the developer at the time, with no outstanding ownership or legal entanglements? Multiple owners are listed in the drawings.\nCan you confirm that the path along the bank was, indeed extended out into the river and significantly straightened, some distance beyond the original bank?\nDid you approve the landscaping and construction proposals, including extension of the path out into the river?\nCan you produce whatever construction details were agreed in relation to the embankment extension, including how the sand martins were to be accommodated (according to planning approval conditions C15 and R15)?\nDo you know exactly which individual inspected the materials and checked the construction of the embankment path including the new foundations, and how they were attached to the foundations of pre-existing buildings ?\nDo you have that individual’s signature of approval on file?\nCan you confirm that the building control inspector was BUTLER & YOUNG RESIDENTIAL LIMITED, Company number 05524898, known as RESIDENTIAL APPROVED INSPECTORS LIMITED between 02 Aug 2005 – 23 Jul 2007?\nCan you produce their approval sheet, showing what requirements they looked for and any notes they made?\nCan you advise why the council chose an outside contractor to perform this duty?\nCan you confirm or deny that your press office has been advising enquirers that the developer has disappeared or gone bankrupt? And if you so confirm, what presumably intervening entity they may be talking about, please?\nDo you agree that the outline of the collapsed area is coincident with the extension out into the river? This can be confirmed by means of a visit, or by travelling along Henry Penn Path on googlemap’s Streetview, whose April 2019 images show a repair (which I believe the council happily undertook). The images are subject to copyright, so I am unable to share them here.\nCan you confirm that planning condition C17 was met by the original construction and – as required – ahead of occupation of the building?\nIf it was not met, can you provide evidence of that failure, and list reasons why it was not?\nIs the adoption of the path recorded in the files and if not, why not?\nWhy was the path repaired by the council before April 2019 (see Google Streetview)?\nDid the council investigate causes of damage at the time it was repaired?\nIf there were issues preventing the path’s adoption, what were they and how were dealt with during subsequent legal searches by potential purchasers?\nAre you able to contradict any or all of the following hypotheses:\nAn element resembling a solid concrete beam has been balanced on top of steel sheeting without no support other than the steel sheet’s own corrugations? Photographic evidence to the contrary is welcome.\nIf this is indeed what happened, would this be an acceptable way to build a river embankment? The contractor builds blocks of flats and roads normally. There is not a lot of water work in their Facebook portfolio.\nBehind the sheeting is sand. Here is similar material taken from a picture about a road being built on the construction company’s Facebook page. This may or may not be what is behind the steel sheeting too.\nUnder the sand is more sand. (If not please provide photographic evidence – not least because something more like hard core might reduce rectification costs).\nClose to the steel sheets is a sewer or drainage channel with an inspection cover.\nThe channel’s original exit into the river has been obstructed or blocked by the new sheet steel. (If not please provide a map or photographic evidence of the unencumbered exit point showing route of and actual flow. This can’t be done now because the river is high).\nWater has built up behind the retaining sheet steel wall and taken sand with it whenever it flowed out into the river. The combined weight of the concrete topping, wet sand and water building up has been so great that over time, it pushed the corrugated steel sheeting out of the vertical and tilted it out and over the river. Considering what it has had to put up with, that sheeting is doing rather well. I’d love to know how it is planted into the river bed.\nIf my hypotheses cannot be disproved by the council, does the council accept some responsibility for the state of the embankment and if so, in what proportion (if not 100%)?\nWhy doesn’t the council ask the original builder to fix the problem (assuming it can’t prove it didn’t cause the problem) with relevant checks by a suitably qualified council employee at every single stage of the rectification? The builder is known for its charitable and community good works and would doubtless be appalled to discover what has happened.\nWhy hasn’t the council already asked them? It has had nearly four years to sort out a sensible remedy. How much has been spent trying to bat this cost away?\nTo conclude, maybe someone should ask Wayne Fitzgerald why he didn’t suggest this right away?\nIt is notable that Cllr Fitzgerald has been very vocal on this issue although he was new in office back in 2007, and so might struggle to explain the appointment of an external inspector.\nTo conclude, The council has been let down by at least one contractor – possibly two. It is perfectly possible that the council can (and I hope will) identify exactly how this happened. If contracting out saves money (which I personally never believed but is the reason frequently given by Conservative politicians), then some of the vast amounts the council will have saved by adopting this cost saving ideology must surely be available for use now?\nAnd as an aside, please can someone audit the presence or otherwise of minutes? There is at least one set missing (29th January, 2007).\nI am always happy to be corrected. And I am always very grateful for incoming information.\nHenry Penn Walk collapse update\nHenry Penn Walk collapse update\nNeglect of City Centre River Walk on North Embankment of River Nene\nPhotos of the sorry state of collapsed Henry Penn Walk have been posted on Facebook by We Love Peterborough.\nI documented the state of the path in August 2021. You can compare WLP’s recent photo here with mine:\nfrom We Love Peterborough Facebook post 5 Jan 2023 my photo, slightly different angle, Aug 2021\nBut the problem pre dated my first blog on the subject by a long way. There is a closed report on the council’s website, dated 20th October 2020.\nSince I wrote that blog, I’ve been told that the reason nothing has been done to repair the broken path is that Peterborough City Council, (possibly Environment Agency) and one or more developers can’t agree on who owns the path and also that it was built out over the river without planning or any other kind of permission (I’m not sure what the procedure is for building out into a river). As ever I’m happy to be corrected if I have been misinformed this latter point. A slightly different story appeared almost a year ago, when a swift end to the legal tangle, (but apparently not involving the EA) was expected. It suggests that the council agrees it owns the surface of the path. But not its foundations. (Could that happen and if so, how could it have arisen?)\nA legal battle may make it awkward for the parties to it to speak to the press. But two of those parties are funded by the tax payer and the tax payer should be told why a solution and suitable repair could not precede settlement of the case. The costs could be recouped – if necessary – by means of a legal charge on the property. If the path is a property which was built by means of illegal invasion of the river, which seems a bit unlikely, what is the remedy in law? Does an illegal property exist or is it a bit like Schrödinger’s cat? Can a property which should not even be there be compulsorily purchased or confiscated? Can it even have an owner? Could a proper repair cost more than the value of a shoddy property (I’d bet it could). I think we should be told.\nMost unfortunately the council has set an awful precedent in Park Ward, where a drain it was given by Peterborough Development Corporation was built out into by a neighbouring property owner and a hideous building was given retrospective planning permission. So the council has established a flabby attitude to allowing people to develop beyond their own boundaries and into its watery properties (not something I condone or recommend).\nBut even if the story I was told holds water, it should be possible to find out who built a path on the bank capable of being washed away. While the flats were under construction, the whole site was fenced off, so the general public would not have been able to see anything. Is the organisation which built a soluble embankment still in business?\nIt should be possible to establish the position of the river bank before and after the flats were built. It should be possible to find out how many building regulations checks were performed as the flats were built and whether or not the rogue path was spotted or anything done about it during the flats’ construction. This is something the council’s planning department should be able to establish. I don’t have photographs. But someone must have some.\nI’ve been assured that no danger is posed to the buildings, but even if this is true, it is not the impression given by the landscaping: the dodgy path appears to have been held up by a steel retaining wall which has very definitely failed. It isn’t clear to the casual passer by (even if it is to the council’s structural engineering expert) what is holding the flats up. If the council’s building inspectors missed a dodgy retaining wall, can we be sure that they checked the one which may or may not be behind the dodgy one and which may or not be holding the embankment under the flats in place?\nThe path poses obvious hazards to pedestrians and cyclists and has, rightly, been closed. However repairs to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, even in Central Ward in Peterborough does not carry the priority it would if the route happened to carry cars. This despite the fact that the path is on the tourist trail. Peterborough remains a car crazy city and unattractive damage to the north bank river path persists apparently unnoticed by the city’s elected members. Voters should note that Cllr Jamil’s current term of office ends in May.\nStrike and Warm Hub Calendar\nPeterborough’s abnormal Winter 2022 will require unusual navigation\nHere comes some really cold weather and this winter, it will be so easy to hit a strike day unawares. Many people will not be focussing on getting out and about, struggling instead to keep warm with the help of government funded warm hubs. I knew about the council’s hubs, but doubted that people knew how to find them. Last time I’d looked there were about five. Today I found nineteen. The number and complexity of strikes is also exploding as perfectly understandable and justifiable discontent escalates. I’d prefer if this public calendar didn’t stay true for very long, but it is true today. If wage disputes were settled and people received the incomes at levels they need, this Strikes & Warm Hubs Calendar could very quickly be made redundant. But unfortunately only the ruling Tories who make up this awful Westminster government can do that.\nBourges Boulevard floods again\nWhy Bourges Boulevard continues to flood – some possible reasons\nIt is remarkable that Peterborough City Council and Anglian Water can’t seem to get together to clear and improve drainage on Bourges Boulevard just south of the roundabout at Town Bridge. Flooding at this location often happens in very heavy rain and is reported in the local paper, which used to have its big blue sign on a fancy modern office overlooking the roundabout. (The Peterborough Telegraph has since moved out of the city centre.)\nSo what is going wrong?\nAre Anglian Water and the City Council not talking to one another?\nIt seems maybe not. This is not the only location in the city blighted by what looks like an inter authority communication problem.\nFlooding can follow observations of bad smells. It did this time: a reader notes this in a comment to the article. A smell of sewage is a big signal that drains might be blocked somewhere.\nSo are people not reporting poo pongs to Anglian Water?\nWell, oddly, it isn’t possible to report or describe this particular phenomenon accurately using Anglian Water’s ludicrously coy website. There is no free text field on its reporting forms, and every option avoids any mention of the blocking or the contents of sewers.\nI recently tried to report this problem at a different location and stumbled across this inexplicable reporting obstacle. The closest to a poo-stink-likely-to-be-a-drainage-problem I was able to report referred me to the “local drainage authority” (which in Peterborough is Peterborough City Council). Anglian Water’s reporting system also asks for my water account details, which are as relevant to a drainage problem wherever I happen to find it as my inside leg measurement. So, a bit cross, I rang them up. I know this is inadequate, but it is all I can recommend at the moment. So\nIf you smell poo, do a number one and a number two:\none: telephone Anglian Water on 0345 145 145\nand\ntwo: phone Peterborough City Council on 01733 747474\nIf anyone can identify a not so intrusive email address for Anglian Water, please put it in the comments, below. If you are happy to provide details of your personal water account (if you have one) when reporting an issue in the public realm you can report it using Anglian Water’s online form.\nIs Peterborough City Council a competent drainage authority?\nI’m not sure that the council is aware that when Peterborough Development Corporation handed its brief and assets over to the council, that package included drainage assets and all drainage authority responsibilities. The drainage boards outside the boundary of the council can be found online and there is local democratic involvement in their management: they are active and if there were to be a problem there is a democratic remedy available to local people. Peterborough City Council seems to think that if it ignores them, its drainage assets will look after themselves. This is certainly what happened in Park Ward, when a development on, and its “foundations” in a drain was permitted and the council remarkably failed to assert ownership of the drainage ditch (which it nevertheless clears from time to time). The development made the ditch less manageable and this resulted in a viable long term prospective asset owner walking away. But whatever its position since PDC handed drainage over to it, it has not been able to evade its responsibilities since 2010, when a law was enacted:\n“County and Unitary Authorities have been made Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs) under the Flood & Water Management Act 2010 with responsibilities to prepare and maintain a strategy for local flood risk management in their areas; maintain a register of flood management assets; investigate significant local flooding incidents; issue consents for altering, removing or replacing certain structures or features on ordinary watercourses (outside of Internal Drainage Districts) and play a lead role in emergency planning and recovery after a flood event.” https://www.ada.org.uk/member_type/local-authorities/\nAre Peterborough’s elected members aware of the council’s inherited drainage responsibilities?\nEvidence that they do is welcome.\nIs Peterborough City Council adequately funded to manage its drainage responsibilities?\nLegacy funding was never made available to the council when PDC was abruptly removed from continuing its work to develop and improve Peterborough. This explains the council’s ongoing difficulties funding the maintenance of the landscape the PDC built, including the Green Wheel. Central government has owed the city development infrastructure legacy funding since PDC left. In better economic times, it might have been possible to blur this. But now that the council is up against predictably far heavier rain (due to climate change) and impossible cuts (due to appalling decisions by central government), it makes sense now to claim what’s been due. The city has two MPs. The two of them should be able to do this for the city. They should also know whether other unitary authorities are also owed this funding.\nSo, until I find evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that no, it isn’t.\nIs Peterborough City Council competent to manage drainage and sewer works?\nI welcome evidence that it is. The prevalence of sewage pongs suggests it isn’t. As do the reports listed on the Anglian Water website, which lists long standing sewer repairs still not completed.\nOde to Peterborough’s MP\nHe loved so hard: he loved Joris Bohnson Who lied each time he put his pants on. Pissed on the standards and the regulations And fuddled on land as he mined the oceans. Then he loved Liz Truss who’s gone already Lasted less well than the iceberg lettuce. But leaving left a legacy far more impressive: For she buried a Queen, the Pound and the Tory party.\nInspired by a pre-departure tweet about Liz Truss, who resigned yesterday. “She will be gone soon. Her legacy is actually quite impressive; she buried the Queen, the Pound and the Tory party.\" H. Ickx @FT comments section With thanks to https://twitter.com/DarrenDarker/status/1582104732877066240\nIs that a clue in that crack?\nTomatoes grow on Peterborough’s embankment\nAn enormous crack opened up on Henry Penn Walk and was reported (with extraordinary drone photos taken from above it) on 4th March 2021 in Peterborough Matters when a council spokesperson is reported to have said, “The current state of the walkway is a result of the structure, sheet piling, beneath the path falling.” On 2nd August 2021 the Peterborough Telegraph reported that the council and a corporate landowner were still at odds over who is responsible for the maintenance of this structure. This is an extraordinary standoff, given that a river is a highly dynamic entity, with carving into land and carrying it away away its favourite and constant sport. The embankment constitutes its urban restraint. Wouldn’t it make sense to fix the damage first and then sort out who owed how much in the courts? A few days ago I went to see whether or not the crack had been repaired I found a larger crack than I expected. Close up, the embankment undulates as if there’d been an earthquake or a landslip. A sort of fountain of subsoil sits at could conceivably be the source of the damage (if it got there by being thrust up right out of the ground). It is as if if water got stuck somewhere and had to burst up through what is a remarkably deep layer of tarmac. And guess what is growing just where that pile of subsoil is? Yes. Tomatoes. Of course, they could have been planted in an apartment garden. But wild tomatoes are common in the UK and they are celebrated self seeders. They can be spotted growing happily along railway tracks and wherever human manure distributes their tiny tell tale seeds. So my question is, given Anglian Water’s discovery of a major sewer works scandal not so very far away, at the junction of Wentworth Street and Bourges Boulevard this July (also reported to the council and in our local paper), has Anglian Water investigated whether or not something equally stinky might lurk beneath Peterborough embankment’s spectacular crack? Could damage to, neglect of, a blockage in or a fault in the drains cause damage on this scale? Or, conversely, could the crack have damaged a foul drain, enabling a tell tale seed or two to escape? After all, what force is there, other than water, capable of taking the huge corrugated steel retaining wall holding the embankment in place and bending it out of true? I’m no expert, but I can see that the embankment wall is not vertical any more. My theories about water transporting sewage carrying tomato seeds and pushing steel walls around might both be fanciful. But if anyone has a more sensible explanation, do tell.\nWasting parliamentary time\nThe incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small.\nThis post Brexit government seems remarkably keen to solve microscopic and even non existent problems. The incidence of vote fraud in the UK is vanishingly small. Very effective UK legislation to tackle vote fraud is already in place. QED Vote fraud does not need new legislation.\nHowever imposing “voter ID” is highly likely to have undesirable, oppressive and discriminatory effects and our UK government and our MP know this. Because making it harder to vote suppresses the vote in groups which find things hard anyway.\nBut there would be no harm in raising voter awareness of vote fraud. Vote fraud can and has been effectively detected and prosecuted: here in Peterborough and elsewhere. In fact, anybody taking part in the electoral process can spot vote fraud and report it (as long as they know what to look out for). Moreover it is already a statutory responsibility of the police to protect our democratic systems. If you witness vote fraud while it is actually happening, call the police on 999. If you’ve seen it in the past, report it online. It is a crime, like any other. If our MP is aware of instances which have not been detected, reported and prosecuted, perhaps he could explain what advice he gave those who witnessed a crime and what the police did with all those reports?\nIf my MP believes that the incidence of what he believes is a problem is statistically higher than extremely rare in the UK or if a vote fraud has ever been shown to have influenced the result of an election, perhaps he or our new Police and Crime Commissioner could produce the evidence? Evidence of crime can overturn an election result in the UK, which is exactly as it should be. But while not having enough evidence to substantiate your case can be expensive when an accusation goes to court (as happened after Peterborough’s own 2019 by election) wasting his constituents’ time is not chargeable to our MP and even more unfortunately (given the urgency of what needs doing in parliament) no offence of wasting parliamentary time has yet been put on the statute book. Perhaps it should be?",

Ed claims the award has a dating problem and could therefore have been made ultra vires.\nI was so stunned by the way this was handled by the new mayor (legal advice or comment was not even sought) that I missed the exact words of the dismissal, but it was dismissed in about four words. Could have been “You can’t have that.” Over so quickly.\nBasically from the Spectators Gallery our council appeared not interested last night in defending itself in public against a charge it may have acted “beyond its powers”, i.e. unconstitutionally. Not only that, but on one of the most politically contentious areas of its responsibility: executive pay being a marker for escalating levels of inequality in society and in our organisations.\nWhereas various councillors sprang to support Harrington’s dismissed second motion (which by then was history), not a single councillor supported Ed Murphy’s assertion (either properly at the time or subsequently by way of solidarity or rhetorical effect – both options being wide open to them).\nIt seems to me that there are at least three possible explanations:\nWhich is it? Or is there another?\nSo glad I’m not the minutes secretary!\nI did look up the Phrase and I am still no wiser.\nLikeLike\n“ultra vires” means “beyond powers” according to google translate.\nBasically when an organisation decides what it can do and how those things should be done it gives itself carefully defined powers. (Some organisations might have “standing orders” which define the boundaries of what is OK in exactly the same way.) When that very organisation then does something it didn’t decide it could do or does it in a way it didn’t authorise, it acts beyond the very powers it defined for itself.\nThat could amount to maladministration, which is extremely serious. It could be illegal. It could be merely improper. It could be unenforceable in a court of law. All sorts of uselessnesses.\nBut a “verdict” on what level of offence is committed needs to be arrived at in some sort of orderly fashion, such as that provided by the Ombudsman.\nI don’t know whether anybody complained to the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman can’t investigate if an issue is not raised in the correct fashion.\nI don’t know whether Peterborough City Councillors understand any of the above. Nor why Ed Murphy’s very important point failed to resonate with ANY of them.\nI don’t know whether or not Peterborough City Law officers are responsible for the council’s standing orders.\nLikeLike\nHello Fiona,\nI am very sorry to read about this councils latest abuse of power, which can be added to a very long list of examples that I am personally aware of. I do not think there is any doubt that as long as the conservatives remain in un-opposed control, Peterborough will remain a ‘rotten borough’, in many peoples eyes, and as long as the ombustman contiues its unofficial policy of siding with the council, what-ever the evidenve, I see no possability of justice playing any part in decision making here.\nI would be interested to read any sugestions as to what, if anything can be done to make the people who govern us in any way accountable for their actions,\nReagards,\nAlan\nLikeLike\nHello Alan Sorry for the delay in responding.

To all intents and purposes the applications are the same (the difference is that the one to Northants is simply a time extension until 2016, while the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) is for time and space until 2026). It is unlikely that you are going to like one and not the other, so essentially your reasons for objection will be identical.\nBoth deadlines for submitting your comments are 1st June 2012, and both processes have online forms so that once you have decided on what you want to say you can simply copy and paste it into the relevant forms.\nFor the IPC go to: http://infrastructure.independent.gov.uk/projects/east-midlands/east-northants-resource-management-facility/ and click on ‘Register online’\nFor Northants go to: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx and click on ‘make a comment on this planning application’\nThere is some confusion, as Augean have put in 3 extension applications to NCC:\n12/00031/WAS, which is for extension of the LLW (radioactive waste) permission\n12/00030/WAS, which is for extension of the soil treatment facility\n12/00029/WAS, which is for extension of the hazardous waste permission\nUsing the online comment forms on the Northamptonshire County Council website (see: http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Pages/CurrentEN.aspx you would have to do a separate form for each application (or as many applications as you want to object to.

I’d found them on the May Day Bank Holiday when I had described a filthy fire which had rather spoiled the day.\nAt midday that same Wednesday I heard from the Strategic Regulatory Services Manager:\n“I understand from my Colleague XXX that you have enquired as to why no out of hours Pollution Control Service is provided by the Council. The Council though having a duty to provide a Pollution Control Service has no legal responsibility to provide an out of hours service I am afraid, the decision as to the level of resources put into providing the service and the hours it operates is one in law for the Council to decide. The Council to my knowledge has never provided a out of hours service and has certainly not during the last 7 years.\nIn what is an extremely challenging financial climate difficult decisions have to be made with regards to service provision, and that does result in services Pollution Control being no exception having to operate within financial constraints. From both an efficiency perspective, looking at the most effective use of staff time, and a financial one, budgets having already been set for the year, it is not possible to provide an out of hours service in Peterborough this year.\nIt is appreciated that at times having an officer on call may be helpful to a member of public, officers are however still able through planned measures, to operate when necessary at different in order to gain evidence of any offences being committed. In recent times officers have been able to attend a site at a weekend following prior arrangements in order to observe an illegal bonfire which was known to take place regularly, evidence obtained resulted in the case being put before the courts.\nIn your particular case XXX will continue to liaise with you over the problems you are experiencing.”\nThis response confirms the absence of any out of hours toxic fire procedure. It suggests that the council is content with this situation. If, as happened on Monday, the fire service tells the resident that use of their emergency number is not appropriate, the resident has no way to get a toxic fire put out.\nThen on Friday I the Pollution Control Officer said:\n“Following our conversation earlier this week, I can now provide an update on the issue of the bonfire.\nI have spoken to XXX from the Fire Brigade and he is reasonably confident that following the warnings given both by him and his colleagues to the person on site and the Fire Brigade’s action in extinguishing the fire, the problem is unlikely to recur at this particular site.\nGiven this, the council have decided not to take legal action at this time. The reasons for this are as follows:\n- The most useful legislation for dealing with bonfires is the Clean Air Act. However this Act only applies to “trade or industrial premises” or to waste being burned at a site as part of a business’ activities. The premises in question is a domestic property and there is no evidence that the waste was part of the activity of a business – certainly the fire brigade do not believe any of it was brought to the site from elsewhere and the landlord is (at the moment) essentially the occupier of the premises as it is vacant.\n- For domestic properties, the primary legislation is the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), which has two main provisions that apply here: Statutory Nuisance and the requirements in relation to duty of care and proper disposal of waste.\n- Statutory Nuisance law is rarely applied in ‘one-off’ circumstances because it is much easier to prove the existence (or likely occurrence/recurrence) of a nuisance if it has happened more than once.\n- Burning waste such as that which was burned on Monday is against the provisions laid down in the EPA for the proper disposal of waste. However, the burden for the success of legal action on this would fall very much on yourself and the fire officer as given that no officer of the council witnessed the event (for reasons I hope XXX has explained in his email to you) our effectiveness will be limited.\n- Additionally, there are a number of tests that must be applied to any intended legal action in order to ascertain whether it is reasonable and proportionate and in the public interest. The council believe that prosecuting an individual for a first offence of this nature is not reasonable or proportionate and would not be likely to result in a particularly harsh penalty to act as a deterrent.\nFor these reasons, it is not felt that the time, effort and cost required in taking a case to court are justifiable. Yesterday a hand-delivered letter was issued warning of the potential consequences of any further occurrence. Please can you continue to monitor the situation, and should there be a recurrence of the problem we will investigate the likely occurrence of a nuisance.\nShould you have any further questions please do not hesitate to get in touch. …”\nI am suggesting that we need a working procedure open and available to anybody who wants to get a toxic fire put out and investigated outside the council’s working hours.\nAs things stand I must dial 999 even though the fire service doesn’t consider these events merit an emergency call.\nMy bank holiday and a filthy fire – two days later\nOn Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf\nMy bank holiday & a filthy fire\nMy intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him.

This little tree tilted to get out of the elm’s space. The elm was cut down. (Dutch Elm Disease). This Scots Pine grows at an inexplicable angle, but is completely unmoved by Doris. The orange object on the path should have been binned by the dog’s owner. This is a new problem in Central Park. The park warden used to talk to people and hand out bags. A loose branch hangs high above the flag in the middle of the park. The flag pole needs a little repair too. This rootball must have sounded like cannon being fired when it snapped. Glorious brilliance in the sheared surfaces. Almost gold. Late afternoon in shade. Elsewhere the sun is on it. I wish I could have captured the astonishment in his face as he cycled up to this! When I approached this tree some teenagers were jumping on it. They saw me, looked very sheepish and ran away. They don’t make teenagers like they used to, do they? Twisted and snapped. Sheared. Bright orange surfaces of broken wood. Peter watches Bonnie investigate. The dog was very energetic: the result of having to kept in yesterday. Odd how little the surrounding grass has been disturbed. You’d expect the roots to be all over the place, but no: all broken off, quite neatly.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_fire-service/content_695.html": "My intention this bank holiday was to continue to tidy up after the madness of all that election activity and maybe to venture out into the garden if the rain held off. This morning was beautiful, but much to my disappointment what should have been a day of leisure at home was spoiled by a fire which burned for several hours in a neighbour’s garden. I think it is out now, but as I write this I have a sore throat.\nA while ago I tried to stop the persistent burning of commercial and trade waste in another neighbour’s garden. It took a ridiculous number of phone calls and I learned on that occasion that, outside working hours, phoning the council just doesn’t work.\nI like garden bonfires and a good meal and a good party can be had around a fire. But fires which burn building waste, fabrics, floor coverings, electrical equipment or furniture are all out of order: they are illegal and a statutory nuisance. They are illegal because they cause uncontrolled and potentially lethal air pollution, which has been illegal since the 1950s. These sorts of fires stink, give you a sore throat and give off a tell tale thick black smoke. The toxicity of fires burning plastics and random combinations of synthetic materials is extreme but it seems that many people have no idea how dangerous they are. Near my house two somebodies burned two noxious fires last night (I passed tell tale patches of smoke when I went out for a walk) and with another fire lit today not only are people suffering uneccessary exposure to pollutants, but escaping from the fumes just isn’t possible. Closing windows does not stop smoke or invisible fumes penetrating buildings.\nFire nuisances are one of the biggest problems Peterborough residents have to put up with. They are very nasty to live with and they have an impact on peoples’ health. The city’s air monitors are not always in the right places to pick up these back garden events in residential areas, monitoring apparently being focussed on vehicle emissions by the sides of the busiest roads. And people can’t always pick up the awful smells: as if they had completely lost their sense of smell.\nI haven’t lost mine and I rang 999. The fire service attended immediately and checked that somebody was looking after the fire and left. The fire continued to burn. When I rang Dogsthorpe fire station later to find out what had happened I was told that ringing 999 had not been my best course of action. I had a quick chat explaining exactly how useful I found it going through the correct channels and followed this up with the following email to the fire service.\n“You yourself tried and couldn’t get through to the Environmental Health Officer today – bank holiday. But I think this applies to anybody needing help outside office hours.\nThese fires are usually lit outside working hours and often in the dark: so to solve the problem the council would have to provide a well signposted out of hours service.\nIf you look on its website this is the council’s page about air pollution: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/services_a-z.aspx?ServID=8 and if you click “bonfires” at point 6 you get this a page not found: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/page_not_found.aspx?p=%2Fpage-10443\nthis is the council’s page about nuisances: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/environment/pollution/nuisances.aspx . From there if you scroll down to “useful links” and find click “garden bonfire leaflet” (which should take you to an external link) you get this page not found: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/assets/library/documents/Bonfires_leaflet_Oct07.pdf\nI look forward to hearing your views and whether or not anything can be done to improve this crazy situation.”\nSCREENSHOTS council fire pages 404s\nMeanshile the fireman I had chatted to revisited the fire, because although he hadn’t seen anything nasty in the fire, he had noticed things close to the fire which worried him. When he went back he found carpet and a mattress burning and this decided him to put the fire out.\nI knew that I wouldn’t be able to report this incident to the council by phone today, which is a bank holiday, but I had a go anyway. Peterborough council’s direct line is 01733 747474. This number advises an emergency number, which is 01733 864157.

Our local newspaper has already published this story but has not (so far) provided a list of who voted which way. I suppose this information will eventually be published in the council’s very own minutes, but who ever reads those?\nSo, since several people have asked for a breakdown, here are my gleanings from the Spectators Gallery:\nCON Arculus, Nick ABSTAIN West\nCON Casey, Graham ABSTAIN Orton Longueville\nCON Lee, Matthew ABSTAIN Fletton\nCON Maqbool, Yasmeen ABSTAIN West\nCON Simons, George ABSTAIN Paston\nCON Sanders, David name heard but unable to hear response Eye & Thorney\nCON Allen, Sue name not heard Orton Waterville\nCON Cereste Marco name not heard Stanground Central\nCON McKean, Dale name not heard Eye & Thorney\nCON Walsh, Irene name not heard Stanground Central\nCON Dalton, Matthew NOT VOTING West\nCON Day, Sue NOT VOTING Paston\nCON Elsey, Gavin NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Fitzgerald, Wayne NOT VOTING Bretton North\nCON Goodwin, Janet NOT VOTING Orton Longueville\nCON Harper, Chris NOT VOTING Stanground East\nCON Hiller, Peter NOT VOTING Northborough\nCON Holdich, John (OBE) NOT VOTING Ghinton & Wittering\nCON Kreling, Pam NOT VOTING Park\nCON Lamb, Diane NOT VOTING Glinton & Wittering\nCON Nadeem, Mohammed NOT VOTING Central\nCON Nawaz, Gul NOT VOTING Ravensthorpe\nCON North, Nigel NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Peach, John NOT VOTING Park\nCON Rush, Brian NOT VOTING Stanground Central\nCON Scott, Sheila NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Seaton, David NOT VOTING Orton with Hampton\nCON Serluca, Lucia NOT VOTING Fletton\nCON Stokes, June NOT VOTING Orton Waterville\nCON Thacker, Paula NOT VOTING Werrington South\nCON Todd, Marion NOT VOTING East\nCON Over, David NOT VOTING Barnack\nLAB Forbes, Lisa FOR Orton Longueville\nLAB Jamil, Mohammed FOR Central\nLAB Johnson, Jo FOR East\nLAB Khan, Nazim (MBE) FOR Central\nLAB Knowles, John FOR Paston\nLAB Martin, Stuart FOR Bretton North\nLAB Shabbir, Nabil FOR East\nLAB Shearman, John FOR Park\nLAB Thulbourn, Nick FOR Fletton & Woodston\nLAB Murphy, Ed FOR Ravensthorpe\nLAB Sylvester, Ann FOR Bretton North\nLD Fower, Darren FOR Werrington South\nLD Sandford, Nick FOR Walton\nLD Shaheed, Asif FOR Walton\nLD Davidson, Julia name heard but unable to hear response Werrington South\nPIF Miners, Adrian declared interest, so unable to vote Dogsthorpe\nPIF Ash, Christopher FOR Dogsthorpe PIF Fletcher, Michael FOR Bretton South\nPIF Fox, John FOR Werrington North\nPIF Fox, Judith FOR Werrington North\nPIF Harrington, David FOR Newborough\nPIF Saltmarsh, Christabel FOR Dogsthorpe\nPIF Sharp, Keith FOR North\nPIF Swift, Charles (OBE) FOR “but confused” North\nPIF Lane, Stephen name not heard Werrington North\nI found it very difficult indeed to pick up the voices of the Conservative councillors last night. It was a very muffled vote. I was unaware that “NOT VOTING” was an available option. I wonder whether or not the Conservatives on the council understand what “ABSTAIN” means? If they do, then why did they choose to say “NOT VOTING”? The Chair announced that 23 people voted FOR and that 29 people abstained and that nobody voted against the motion.\nI haven’t caught everyone’s response so I know there are errors and some omissions in this list. Please feel free to correct or explain these if you can (comments are open). The sound system available to councillors is so bad that many struggle to make it work properly. People in a meeting may feel confident to signal their vote to the chair, especially if their views are already very well known.\nAccording to the newspaper “a motion to defer closing the centres so that alternative proposals can be considered was carried following a vote and the issue will now be decided at the next meeting of the council’s cabinet.” But the motion, as I understand it, was proposed by Cllr John Shearman (LAB) and he made a point, immediately prior to the vote, that the motion was to “recommend that Cabinet defer any decision until alternative proposals are proposed, considered and consulted on.”\nWell done Peterborough’s opposition. Last night “spectators” had the pleasure of witnessing over a quarter of Peterborough’s councillors actually holding the executive to account. I have never seen this before.\nThis is what it looked like to another observer: http://parkfarmneighbourhoodwatch.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/childrens-centres-first-for.html\nHere is a photo of the opposition standing up to demand a recorded vote: http://terry-harris.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Full-Council-Childrens-Centre-Closures/G0000xzhmtuMp.a4/I0000UNVajRUjfiU\nBut the big question now is will Cabinet pay any attention at all to the wishes of Council when it meets on Monday at 10am?",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_05_09_what-didnt-happen/content_549.html": "Thursday’s 2023 local election count for Park Ward was, to my mind, excessively long.\nThis morning, while looking for something else, I stumbled upon press reports of what happened at the count. On the basis of Ben Jones’ account, readers of the Peterborough Telegraph might be forgiven for believing that there might have been a recount of votes in Park Ward and that a recount might even explain the late declaration.\nThere was absolutely no recount of votes in Park Ward and this is not why the result was so late. As far as I am aware, no recounts took place at all: winning margins were wide across the whole city.\nThe Park Ward count was grossly delayed and I intend to explain how that happened in detail here. Voters in Park Ward are already confused by the result and it is not fair to worsen that bewilderment with nonsense.\nI have provided, in my first post about the election, a description of the extremely late arrival of one of the ward’s ballot boxes, as seen from where I stood on the night.\nBut there were two additional reasons for the extreme lateness of the Park Ward declaration.\nOne is the use of the grass skirt method of counting a multi vacancy ballots. I have no bone whatsoever to pick with the use of the grass skirt. This is how Bristol does it. Note how some ballots are removed before the counters proceed to the grass skirt itself. Block votes are two (or more) votes cast for candidates of the same party and can be counted in the usual way and the votes allocated to each of the block candidates. The grass skirt is necessarily slower than the usual way of counting single vote ballots into a tray per candidate.\nThe other was the council’s decision not to count separately and temporarily remove from the count table counted block votes prior to sticking the mixed vote ballot papers onto the grass skirts.\nI do have a bone to pick with the decision not to remove these ballots, because it would be as quick to count these into three trays (in Park’s case there were three pairs of candidates) as it is to count individual votes. This decision caused predictable delay and far more grass skirts and slow and steady sticking than I thought necessary: sticking the ballots onto the skirts can’t be done quickly. I couldn’t help feeling there was a hidden reason lurking behind this inexplicable decision: the grass skirt is inherently and by definition dramatic. Grass skirts are unusual in Peterborough (where usually only one seat is up for election) and they are highly photogenic. The Park Ward count was most notable for the number of photographers surrounding the tables. If anyone spots Park Ward’s grass skirts in published material, I’d love to see what all those fancy cameras made of them.\nOn Thursday one grass skirt’s figures were left out of the control sheet’s initial and therefore incorrect total, (the skirts are added up just like spreadsheets and have to add up across and down and ballots have to add up to the total known to have been cast) but the omitted skirt was identified within three or four minutes (not least because each skirt has its own number, so this is child’s play) and its totals were added in. The new totals matched immediately. Correcting this tiny slip on the control sheet cannot remotely be described as a “recount”, nor can a tiny error of transcription carry the can for the hours and hours of delay. Literally nothing needed recounting.\nHad Park Ward votes needed to be recounted, at a similar rate of progress, it would have taken until 6.30 in the morning.\nNo journalist approached me at the count, although I’d have loved such a conversation on this extremely weird night (easily the second weirdest ever) and I didn’t bump into any of the three journalists who have written up the count coverage anywhere else. I have not been approached for comment. I don’t know who was but I would love to know where they derived any information they may or may not have been fed about a “recount” in Park.\nA clarification or a correction as to fact published in the paper would be most welcome.\nHere is a list of local election coverage during the night by Peterborough Telegraph. (Please note that the second and fourth articles have subsequently been updated.)",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2023_04_17_report-on-local-election-hustings/content_300.html": "held in Park Ward on 16th April\nSome people were disappointed at the turnout at yesterday’s candidate hustings at the Willow Cafe in Park Ward, but top community activists tell me that “the people who turn up to things are the right people”.\nThe event was hosted by Park Streets Ahead Residents Association and hosted by Beki Sellick (in her capacity as Chair).\nI was making a cup of tea this morning and it dawned on me that there had been a disproportionately high number of sustainable transport professionals in the room. That speaks to ongoing safety and speeding issues in Park Ward and it tallies with despair on the doorstep that the well understood underlying problems persist unfixed. In fact if we rearranged the chairs in the room, we probably had the skills right there in the room to fix the problem. What these experts don’t have (as things stand) is the council’s ear. Once again, it is often the case that the solutions are not somewhere else: we’ve likely got them right here, in Park Ward.\nCandidates on the ballot paper turned up, with the exception of the Labour and Reform candidates.\n| ARFAN Khan | address is on ballot | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| ASIF Muhammad | (address in Peterborough) | Conservative Party Candidate |\n| HARDMAN Ian | address is on ballot | Liberal Democrat |\n| HUSSAIN Junayd | (address in Peterborough) | Labour & Co-operative Party |\n| MORRIS Sue | (address in Peterborough) | Reform UK |\n| RADIC Fiona | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| WILSON Steve | address is on ballot | The Green Party |\n| YASIN Sabra | (address in Peterborough) | Labour Party |\nThe full list for all wards is here.\nAttending in the audience, were just the right number of loud voices. True, many people didn’t say anything, but, for whatever reason, they decided not to speak.\nIt was not a scary event. There were no fights and I did not spot intimidation. However, I took one concern expressed to the host at face value and will catch up with this (and them) as and when I can.\nI have come across electoral malpractices including intimidation which is a known (but I believe increasingly historic) problem in Park Ward and it is one of the reasons why CCTV cameras are frequently installed outside some or all of Park’s polling stations. I am aware of various pressures which have been applied over the years to voters in Park Ward (they tell me about shocking things going on in the past). Most of these pressures are “normal” family, social or party influences and feelings of obligation, which are part of normal life and a functioning democracy. But once a person feels they are being bullied, losing their right to choose freely or even having their vote stolen, voters and candidates shouldn’t hesitate to call the police or Electoral Services at the council (who can work out what the problem might be and will liaise with the police if necessary).\nJohn Peach in the middle of the room does not (in my book) constitute intimidation: his body language and his Cheshire Cat grin said louder than words how much enjoyed the event (announced on the 5th), despite failing to invite his online newsletter readers (emailed on the 8th) across the ward to it. Probably a communication problem rather than a deliberate omission.\nThere was disappointment expressed by a couple of people at the event’s format, which was cabaret layout for the audience and mingling for candidates, designed to facilitate more personal encounters. The room has a lovely but hard floor so for the hard of hearing one speaker at a time would work, whereas two voices would blur each other out. There was a very good (but also very well resourced) accessible hustings held during Peterborough’s parliamentary by-election in 2019.\nIt is worth pointing out that the traditional format (high table at the top for the candidates and seats for the public arranged as if for a theatre show – like BBC Question Time) does allow for the person who wants to ask a question to take the floor and, if they want to, to command the room. This can be more interesting than what is said by the candidates, especially as they get increasingly tired and hackneyed as campaigning continues . It also allows for a bit of tit for tat between candidates and lets them demonstrate (and develop and practice) any debating skills they have: very likely to come in handy if elected.\nThe event was recorded by an unknown individual at the back who didn’t ask permission or make himself known to the host. I have no idea if the recording will go anywhere: but I doubt it. Shout if you spot it.\nNobody took names of attendees or pictures. It was probably the least “posed” hustings I’ve attended and that makes a pleasant change.\nSo, in summary all good. Thank you Park Streets Ahead for the invitation. And well done, Beki Sellick for doing very well the incredibly tough job of chairing.\nI got a great deal out of attending and personally enjoyed it very much.

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2012_05_09_my-bank-holiday-and-a-filthy-fire-two-days-later/content_553.html": "On Bank Holiday Monday I posted a story about a filthy fire. As I said in that post, I had left a message asking the council’s Environmental Health Officer to phone me back. The message was left with the council’s emergency out of hours service.\nBy 09:40 on Tuesday morning I had not received a phone call, so I phoned the council. The main switchboard told me that the council did not have an Environmental Health Officer (see Note 1 below) and asked me what my call was about. She wanted to know whether to direct my call to “pollution” or “safety”. I opted for pollution.\nBy chance I was put through to the “pollution officer” for my district. He told me that he was one of three pollution officers for the unitary authority area of Peterborough. He hadn’t received my message from the emergency out of hours service (and as I write this post he hasn’t emailed me to tell me he’s found it), so I briefed him on what had happened. How the fire service had put the fire out once toxic materials were found on it. And he confirmed that burning the kinds of items described would constitute an offence under the Clean Air Act\nI asked him about the council’s out of hours service which fails to provide a mechanism for either putting out a toxic fire, getting council staff to the event, or even reporting it, or even getting a message through. He explained that there would be a high level decision determining spending on this service and that he would try to help me understand where that decision had been made. Meanwhile he said that the emergency services should certainly be called if all else failed. He mentioned how noise nuisances are regularly reported to the police out of hours. He said he would go and inspect the situation. This particular fire I will now stop posting about until I know whether or not the council decides to prosecute.\nHe rang me back later in the day to report on progress and agreed to ask a colleague to give me a call about how the council had made its decisions about out of hours services. He also told me that the broken links had been fixed and would be correct on the website by the morning.\nThis morning I checked the links. One has been removed and both pages now point to a single outside link: http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/\nSo now at least there is a working link to a some garden bonfire content under nuisance. Thank you Peterborough City Council pollution and IT teams!\nWhat the council’s website now points to is content on a charity website. The charity has published this leaflet, with the same content. What do you think? Is this robust enough?\nShould the council have its bonfire policy? The leaflet suggests that there isn’t much point. If you want a good, informative source of information on bonfires this response to a FOI request takes a bit of beating. But the messages in that document don’t seem to me to get enough of an airing, nor do they seem to be falling on the waste burners’ ears.\nWhich could be partly why we have so many filthy fires burning in my area.\nNote 1: In December 2010 the council had three, presumably fully qualified officers: http://www.peterborough.gov.uk/PCC/FOI/Docs/foi-10-0539-R.pdf\nI don’t suppose there was any calculation involved: I doubt there was any thought whatsoever, beyond saving the expense of a trip to the Householders’ Waste dump. I genuinely don’t think people know about dioxins, thalates, cyanides, PCBs, chlorines, fluorines…. http://plasticisrubbish.wordpress.com/2008/06/02/dioxins-why-you-dont-want-to-be-burning-plastic/ ……and that is just the plastics. What about paint? Dyes? Nylons? Foams? Fibres? Metals …………..\nThey don’t know because nobody is telling them. The ET could run a shock horror story on this any time it wanted. The penalties in law are fines of up to £20,000, so it would be only fair to warn people. People should know about the law and the possible fines as well as about the hideous dangers presented by burning complex synthetic substances.\nYou have a point about my option to call a councillor: but my objective is not to achieve an “ET story” or “waves”. What I want to achieve is a working out of hours toxic fire procedure available to any resident in my local authority area. Wow: that’s a mouthful. I tried once to achieve this and failed, and am now having another go.\nGetting a single fire dealt with does not achieve this. Nor does a newspaper story.\nLikeLike\nYou mean you want a complete solution, not a partial one?\nGood luck.\nI fear, however, you may find yourself waiting a long time.\nLikeLike\nWell done for some dogged sleuthing. And rightly so – that fire sounds calculated to offend.\nOne question for you. No surprise that a council officer should have been hard to raise, but why didn’t you hassle a councillor instead?\nThey have the virtue of being easily contactable, there’s a good chance they’d make waves on the Tuesday morning, and there’s a good pick – with three local members to choose form plus key figures on the relevant committee(s).\nAnd bonus – had a councillor turned up, you’d have had the makings of an ET story.\nLikeLike",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_2019_01_30_political-advertising-and-social-media-part-two/content_595.html": "Social media offers politicians a very tempting way of doing all sorts of things. To my mind, there is nothing wrong with that. On the face of it.\nBut what people reading things on social media don’t always know is that there are laws governing political messaging and advertising, and also that social media offers ingenious ways of getting round rules.\nOne of the UK rules is to do with imprints: basically an imprint allows the reader to understand who is behind what they are reading. In turn this allows the reader to check who is behind whatever or whoever is being promoted. Look for the small print on any political flier which is delivered through your letterbox. You should find it. It is a legal requirement.\nThis “imprint” is key to finding out who is being promoted (usually a candidate) and (with this knowledge) who is funding a political campaign, and yes, there is also UK legislation surrounding political donations to UK campaigns. Another legal requirement is to obey the laws about donations.\nCampaigners in Peterborough found a piece of printed material which lacked an imprint during the EU Referendum campaign. This was reported to the Electoral Commission. It is an offence to omit an imprint, although this A5 flier wasn’t impressive and at first glance this is not a big thing. It could always be someone who is a newcomer to political campaigner and who doesn’t know any better. That’s wrong, but understandable. But….\nThe imprint rules for social media advertising by political entities have no legal force behind them. They are merely recommendations laid down by the Electoral Commission indicating basic standards of good practice. This leaves people who know very much better than a beginner able to advertise on social media, deliberately concealing the organiser, the cause, the funder and the objectives. One I think fits this description crossed my path recently.\nHere’s me, picking up on someone’s comment that an image in a facebook advertisement featured comes from a Third Reich archive. It reminded me of a certain Prime Ministerial field of wheat. Even the wheat is old fashioned: we don’t grow it tall like that any more. We’re in the realms of nostalgia.\nHere’s his tweet:\n…….\n…….\nWhat seized my interest is that I’ve already seen the image out of the corner of my eye. It has already crossed my facebook feed, but as I was doing something else (as I usually am) I paid it no attention: I registered the image, but didn’t read the text. This is how subliminal advertising works. But now that someone has said something astonishing about the picture the advertisement, text and picture, now has my full attention. So (apologising for the format – it looks so much better on twitter!) here we go:\nThis looks like an operation to collect email addresses and to raise funds: but it will have to be funded by someone, somewhere. I and every other person who encounters this should be able to see who is doing what and for whom. We can’t.\nPart one was an email, and isn’t on my blog.\nHappy to be corrected: I looked at this a few days ago and just went over what I did. Nothing much has changed, except the organisation now claims it is in the UK (but doesn’t provide an address) and the entity the website claims is editing it is apparently also in the UK: https://twitter.com/rjdavies7 I have no idea if these two accounts relate to the same human being.",
  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_category_news_page_17/content_723.html": "Last night the committee with a very long name about which I have blogged previously met again, this time to consider a Call-In Request.

No declarations of interest were made.\nThe Committee voted once again without any discussion whatsoever and without reference to any submission to it to maintain the exemption of key documents.\nI could not identify who voted which way nor, without a discussion, why.\nThe meeting has already been covered elsewhere by the Peterborough Evening Telegraph and Park Farm Neighbourhood News This morning it was discussed on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\nAt nine o’clock the Chair was persuaded to move to a comfort break followed by a short public session for sharing the “milestones”, (possible timescale for implementation of the decision) followed by the exempt session.\nThis time excluded members of public and press were invited to use the Forli Room and make themselves a drink. We were also invited back for the non exempt conclusion of the meeting, so there was an opportunity to observe the vote and further non exempt discussion.\nWhen the committee announced its readiness to go into exempt session some members of the public decided to stay seated. This would be a protest at the absence of any public interest debate.\nThe Chair invited the beadles to try to throw us out and a beadle was fetched and duly and politely invited us to leave. (This has happened before to a couple of us at a Planning Meeting, but on that occasion a beadle couldn’t be found.)\nWe responded by asking the Chair to follow standing orders and invite a debate on whether or not the public interest might actually lie in sharing the information which is currently hidden and described as exempt. She cheerfully agreed to this request and invited just such a debate.\nNo member of the scrutiny committee spoke in favour of disclosure or why it might be in the public interest to disclose exempt information (please correct me if I missed something). In fact I can’t remember anything any of the committee members said. I do remember three legal arguments being presented by the council’s lawyer. No committee member countered these or put up alternative or competing views.\nCouncillor Lee‘s contribution to these proceedings was to protest his willingness to go out of his way to share more than he was legally obliged to in advance of the moment when he was legally obliged to share it, but he would seriously consider never doing this again if this was the kind of reception his helpfulness got.\nCllr Nick Sandford (LIBERAL DEMOCRAT) who was present and sitting alongside members of the committee by virtue of his position as a political group leader did speak out at this point (and at many other moments) in favour of publication, openness and (a new point) fairness (by then quite a few nuggets of exempt information had been dropped into the public domain by the pro-incinerator team which appeared to be free from the obligation placed on councillors to maintain secrecy).\nThe Chair seemed to me slightly less hasty to stop people talking than she has been at previous meetings. Slightly less grim. And all Tories present seemed entirely confident of the outcome of the meeting. She didn’t rush to silence so many contributions this time. With the notable exception of Councillor Nazim Khan (LABOUR), who sat alongside the committee (by virtue of his position as a political group leader). He was prevented from speaking twice, I think. I am not sure why, except that on one occasion I surmised that it might have been to allow the committee members to speak first. But that is another blog.",

It could create thousands of jobs, bring in billions in tax revenues and secure our energy supply for the future. However, let me assure you that I strongly believe fracking operations should be safe, and must not be at the expense of local communities or the environment.\nSafety is the top priority of the Government. The UK has over 50 years of experience in regulating the onshore oil and gas industry and we have a strong regulatory regime for shale gas extraction. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for checking all aspects of operator’s plans and designs. No site will be given the go ahead without first meeting strict safety criteria.\nThe risk of water contamination is low when the correct regulations are followed. The Environment Agency will work with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure high standards are maintained and that the quality of our water is properly protected. The Environment Agency will make an assessment of any chemicals an operator proposes to use in fracking and will not authorise the use of hazardous substances where there is an unacceptable risk they would enter groundwater.\nWater for fracking operations has been provided by local water companies, which are obligated to produce and update a long-term plan every five years that has contingency reserves in case of a drought. Therefore water companies will assess the amount of water available before providing it to operators.\nThank you again for taking the time to contact me.\nYours sincerely,\nStewart Jackson\nMember of Parliament for Peterborough",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_author_fionaradic_page_8/content_747.html": "I have asked people why the council hadn’t gone all out to fund a replacement bridge as soon as it realised Rhubarb Bridge was suffering an unusual degree of decay. This would have made sense, especially since there are national funding pots for sustainable travel infrastructure, and this bridge might well have qualified.\nSince then I have I received one really useful reply. My interlocutor pointed out to me that the money for repairs and maintenance comes out of the Revenue pot at the council. Revenue is for running costs, costs which recur year after year. The money for the an surface roundabout or for a replacement bridge would come out of the Capital pot. Capital is for one off costs, for buying or building assets such as buildings and infrastructure.\nThis made me think. Pressure on the Revenue pot is extreme. And it might be this extreme funding pressure which is leading to a decision not to maintain. If it replaces an an annual maintenance bill with a one off capital bill (with arguably a smaller ongoing maintenance cost), it will be relieving pressure on the funds which are needed to look after people in extreme need.\nFunding pressures on local government affect their Revenue funding primarily. Pressure on capital funding is not as bad. Revenue funds are used to fund social care, road repairs and waste disposal. It is this funding stream which is under impossible strains as central government imposes its Austerity measures and renders all our services less and less able to cope. So all local authorities have to balance roads and waste against social care. It is quite clearly insane, but until we sack the government as we are entitled to do at each general election, there is no sign of a change in this wicked situation. And local authority roads get a small fraction of the maintenance money which Highways England gets to maintain trunk roads. Unfortunately Rhubarb Bridge does not belong to Highways England. It belongs to the council.\nThis leaves a number of items which haven’t been accounted for: lets call them uncounted elephants in the room:\nThe likely cost of accidents at an at surface crossing. It is clear that this has not been factored in. There is clearly an increased risk of impacts on emergency, hospital and care services budgets.\nThe impact of being at ground level at an air pollution hot spot on all pedestrian and cyclists using the route. The higher you are the less likely you are to be inhaling high concentrates of particulates. The closer you are the more certain it is. In pushchairs children are face to face with exhaust pipes and this is just one reason (of many) why parents pop them in what seems to be the safer environment of a car.\nThe at surface crossing will result in cyclists taking to the road, rather than wait.\nThe at surface crossing will result in people getting into a car in preference to walking with a pram or pushchair.\nAnd it leaves my original question standing: why the council hasn’t tried to get hold of (let us add “capital”) funding to rebuild the bridge – if it is beyond economic repair?\nAn event for councillors and stakeholders was held last week in the Town Hall. A similar public event is scheduled to be held next week. I would recommend people living near the bridge or using it regularly go if they possibly can.\nI am a member of Peterborough Cycling Forum (PCF) (one of the council’s stakeholders), which has put the council’s event on facebook. Quite a few PCF members turned up and three or four councillors also popped in while I was there.\nBackground\nWhich bridge? Rhubarb Bridge is the popular (but strictly incorrect) name of a cycle and pedestrian up and over bridge at the junction of the A15 (Lincoln Road – Bourges Boulevard) with the A47. The name is taken from a bridge which has long since gone. It went over a railway and had rhubarb growing on its embankment. The council calls it J18.\nThe council had claimed that the bridge needed to be demolished because it was no longer viable to continue to repair and maintain it: it had reached the end of its life. My overriding concern was to establish whether or not this was fair: I’d not spotted problems with the structure, so I was sceptical. The council’s structural engineer attended.\nThe bridge is a complex structure with four ways up onto a wider part of the bridge, which dips down a little into a tunnel under the A47. So it is both a bridge over Bourges Boulevard but also a tunnel under the A47. The council thinks of it as six bridges, two, the wider bits extending out from the tunnel, and the four, each of the four “legs” down.\nAt the event we were shown photographs of the bridge showing its condition. These will be published online on Wednesday 9th along with all the other planning documents we saw. These were a map, a description of the problems presented by the bridge and how the council proposes to deal with them, and the photographs. There is also a movement model, showing how traffic will be held at crossings and how it will flow once there are four lanes leading into some of the stop points. Extra lanes will be added to the A47 slip road from the east, and to the junction with the Lincoln Road coming from the north, so four lanes of traffic will queue at each of these two sets of traffic lights.\nSo this is what we now know (things we don’t know are in bold)\nThe bridge was constructed in 1975.\nAt PCF’s last meeting we were told that there is nothing structurally wrong with the tunnel under the A47. This is very important, because it means it could be incorporated into a new design. We were told that once the bridge structures are demolished, the tunnel will be closed off and filled with foam. You can see pictures of the tunnel under the A47 here. You can see that the tunnel is neglected decoratively, so it is good to know that at least it is structurally sound.\nThe bridge structure requires repair and maintenance costing £60,000 a year to keep it safe for use.\nI asked why since so many of the city’s bridges have been capable of repair, this particular one isn’t. The answer I was given is that the structure is more delicate than most of Peterborough’s repaired and mostly road over road bridges, meaning that any internal problems will be closer to the surface and integrity is less likely in the absence of sheer size and bulk. Relatively speaking, it is an elegant structure.\nThe bridge is made of a number of elements formed of reinforced concrete with tensioned steel at their heart. Some of these support the weight of a span and some of them are the spans.\nIf for example you need to repair or even replace a stanchion (a supporting pillar), you might not be able to lift the span resting on it without first repairing the span itself. This is complicated and the council argues more expensive than can be justified.\nI’m not going to comment on the state of the bridge, except to say that I am no longer confident that it is structurally sound. My impression is that there were some basic concrete mixing failures when it was originally constructed. It is a huge shame, because it is a nice bridge. The pictures are worrying, although they don’t give a complete picture of the state of the whole bridge and you’d need to be a bridge expert to quantify the risk.\nThe problem areas have been repaired and wrapped in Kevlar, so those pictured here will not be visible. I asked what would happen if you unwrapped the Kevlar and was told the concrete might very well come off too.\nHowever we have not seen itemised maintenance and repair expenditure on the bridge to date or estimated future costs for this.\nThe council argues that if it was to proceed and maintain this bridge at high cost, a route through for cyclists and pedestrians would have to be provided while works were underway.\nThe route through at ground level is essentially what the council’s proposal is and what is proposed could stay there while work was undertaken on the bridge, whether the bridge was repaired, or the bridge was replaced.\nThe proposal includes a route which goes all the way round the central island which holds up the A47. This means that during future bridge works, people could be diverted away from whichever section was being worked on by simply being sent the other way round the centre.\nThis central ring is partly shared use & 3wide which means cyclists don’t have to dismount and a smaller part, on the eastern side which is much narrower, which will require dismounting (designing in conflict, in other words).\nIf the bridge could be repaired, it could be kept much as it is. The existing bridge is marked, though faintly, on the plan.\nIf the bridge was replaced with a new bridge, then it would have to meet current standards and specifically its ramps would have to be a lot shallower and therefore longer than they now are. So a ramp which meets the ground now, might have to go an awful lot further in a new design and there might be a road junction just where it is almost at ground level…..\nSkanska has prepared a number of options for a replacement bridge, but these were not presented at the event.\nThe council’s £30M replacement figure has been arrived at by an accounting formula. It is not based on the Skanska designs, which may not have been costed.\nWhat we don’t know is:\nThe significance and heritage value of this structure. It has been described as a very early “Dutch roundabout”. Peterborough doesn’t sing the praises of the development corporation which put much of its road infrastructure on the map. The mini roundabout was born in Peterborough. We demolished that. At grade separation of cyclists and pedestrians was pioneered here and this bridge is part of that revolution in road design. Now we are changing the original plan and working to lower speeds on the very roads whose high speeds were once seen as their selling points. This roundabout is where old meets new. One thing is certain: cyclists (and I am guessing pedestrians also) don’t want to be at ground level at this particular point in the city! Is Peterborough going to let the Dutch get all the glory for cycling infrastructure or will it assert the value and interest of having once tried to get things right for cyclists?\nWhy the council has not planned in a replacement bridge and applied for funding for it, possibly as part of its sustainable travel spend. I’d missed it, but apparently this bridge was on the list of things which needed tackling two – or maybe more – years ago.\nHow long the bridge could stay in place as is (i.e. what leeway there is to postpone demolition).\nI attended an event last Thursday which was about Rhubarb Bridge, but before I post anything about that, this is just a little news about the next bridge over the A47 going east (towards Wisbech). This bridge is on Highways England’s list of repairs and should be getting some much needed attention very soon. I hope it isn’t closed for long. It is certainly not planned for demolition. It is a useful bridge enabling cyclists and pedestrians to shortcircuit (North /South) one of Peterborough’s oddest and most confusing roundabouts over and onto the A47 (as it goes East/West).\nPlease suspend Cllr Andy Coles. It is reasonable that he is suspended.\nIt is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while Jessica’s allegations of dreadful behaviour, (amounting to state sanctioned rape) remain unresolved.\nI believe that the Conservative Party is the only body able to suspend a Conservative Councillor who won’t resign.\nPlease let me know if I have been incorrectly advised.\nWhy I believe you have no choice: In other words: If Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, you as the Leader of Peterborough City Council are placing yourself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors (including those who are not members of the Conservative Party) and your entire party and its national membership in the same place as and appearing to collude with whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether the long list of people I have listed like it or not, and without a single one of them getting a vote on the matter).\nWhy suspending him is critical for the reputation of the city:\nIf whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so promptly, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity and (unfortunately now) your stated personal approval (I think you may have done this in some ignorance of the gravity of what has been alleged – I know you are a very busy man).\nThe council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. The council does not need this. Peterborough does not need this. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests: not even Cllr Coles’.\nBackground & Why I Think What I Think\nResign Cllr Andy Coles!\nI called for Andy Coles to resign as soon as I heard about and read up on the allegations made against him by “Jessica” (not her real name). The Channel 4 programme was viewable for a day or two, but was taken down very promptly (I think). This programme alone was sufficient to convince me that he would have his hands full dealing with the allegations, whether he was innocent or guilty and that either way he had to resign.\nSince I thought I knew Andy Coles, liked him and above all, found him relatively easy to talk to (which is unusual in my experience of Peterborough Conservative Party members in Peterborough) my very first response to Jessica’s story was disbelief. I’d seen him do what looked like useful work in the creative arena in the city, in West Town (not my patch) but also in the campaign to Save The Green Backyard #SaveGBY a major environmental project which had been under threat, but which had been saved (that means granted a 12 year lease) with a lot of help from elected councillors from various political parties. I first learned about him at the Green Back Yard while he was still a top bar bee keeper and at that time he was trying to help a woman who has since died to parish West Town, which I would very strongly support.\nBut none of my prejudice in his favour affected my call on him to resign. Calling on him to resign wasn’t about the truth or otherwise of the allegations. This was solely about his ability to cope with what was alleged and being in elected position at the same time.\nCould a troubled teenager go to him as her councillor for help? Not in my opinion.\nThat would be simply impossible until the facts were established in some sort of due process and he’d cleared his name. His family’s ability too. My heart went out to his family. Then I realised I’d never met any of them and suddenly I had one of those lurches deep in the gut. I’d had a similar experience before: tiny tiny bells ring so small you simply don’t hear them until suddenly the floor vanishes from under your feet. I gasped as a new reality – a new set of possibilities – a new narrative entirely – opened up beneath me. My memory raced back as little doubts were sown. As you fall like Alice you grab the things on the wall of the hole. What did and didn’t I know about Andy? Everything I knew about him was suddenly capable of meaning something entirely different. From that moment of doubt until now, there have been for me two Andys. Jessica’s Andy and the one I thought I knew right up to the moment I read her story. I could place one little cut out character (let’s face it, I don’t really really know a lot about either Andy) on top of the other with no trouble at all. They slotted together perfectly. The things Jessica said fitted into the life of the person I knew. All he’d had to do was leave little things out when talking to me. Everybody does that: it is nothing remarkable. That is surely exactly how nobody notices how things are done both covertly and in plain sight. For anyone who has read the exposure story, he is not the same man. If he remains the same to them, they haven’t really read it.\nI began to confront the plausibility of Jessica’s story.\nI thought back. We’d had a long conversation in town over coffee. Cllr Andy Coles was recently elected and had just taken charge of Children’s Services from Cllr Sheila Scott. I said “Good: that job needs someone with a brain.” There had been no doubt in my mind at all that he was as bright as a button. This guy had a degree in what seemed a relevant subject and right or wrong, the plight of Childrens’ Services at the time was being laid firmly at the stodgy, uninformed ineducable and totally immoveable Scott’s door (I accept I might be right or wrong about her, but she is typical of a type of councillor who I keep being forced to conclude is literally impermeable). I saw a background in policing as hugely beneficial to the role: he’d have a perspective and a brilliant training: with skills such as investigation, scepticism, analysis to hand. He asked me about my family: kids, husband. I thought these questions were downright impertinent on a first acquaintance so he got public domain basics: not the specifics he was cheekily after.\nSince the allegations sank into my consciousness I have defriended him on facebook, where he has made friends with a huge number of my facebook friends. I’ve defriended some of his (for all I know perfectly nice and decent) political friends. I have to. Facebook is a political network as well as a social network and I’m not sure how the facebook network has been used, whether or how my friendships with real people have been used in real life and for what. Most of my facebook friends see no harm in him at all. I can’t do that.\nThinking back to that over inquisitive conversation. That friendly bright face, those honest eyes. Had he been miked up? What else did I say? He told me his family had been in shoe manufacturing when he was little. I told him I love design. I used to love shoes: that I’d once considered studying at the Cordwainers. Did I tell him how I got into design? About the putti I sculpted in the garden that very hot summer? I think I did. He told me that his family business failed along with most of the English shoe making industry and that that was the moment when he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.\nOMG The Met and maybe MI5 knows that I totally adore Kinky Boots!\nDid I share that with him? Almost certainly, since the only reason we were talking was that Peterborough was trying to rise from the ashes of its industrial past and face the total horror of continuing Austerity by sparking the creative sector it had so far suppressed pretty effectively. Regeneration, niche markets: that was why we were talking. Campaigning to do good things, like save The Green Backyard, which we both knew was an incubator for sustainable projects, for good green things. I felt that as if he’d taken a crucial piece of clothing off me and I hadn’t even noticed. I felt exposed. I understand power and how uneven it is. I’ve been stamped on (though never ever like Jessica). I think most women have had a moment. But we think we grow. We develop out and beyond those naive moments. We wouldn’t put ourselves through that again, would we? But that conversation can never be again what it was at the time. Sharing requires trust. I can no longer trust Andy Coles.\nDid he walk all over me?\nI require him to be totally and unconditionally exonerated\nbefore I can have a normal conversation with him again. Some of my friends are struggling to believe that he could be what Jessica claims. They are lovely people and they see the nice guy. I’m not quarrelling with them. I’m not a judge and I am perfectly well aware that every person is entitled to a hearing and due process in the face of an allegation. Frankly I am concerned that he won’t get due process.\nThe people of Peterborough, if they only knew, would require the same\nNot every voter follows what councillors get up to, let alone what is alleged about them. Very few people even knew we had a General Election.\nWomen, if only they knew, would deserve and require the same\nBut I also understand power and I understand where women are in relation to men. The salary differentials. Pension inequality. The horrendous abuses. Women in Peterborough experience terrible oppressions. I’ve met women who are walked over, trodden on, beaten down. Who have nowhere to go. I’ve campaigned for women in prison. I’ve seen despair. I know women who’ve lost their children here. Our society has been like that. We fight like cats to make it better, but we shouldn’t have to. I see disparities, unevennesses everywhere I go. I know what it feels like to be looked at as if you are a piece of shit. That happened to me only LAST SUNDAY afternoon, outside Peterborough Prison, where I joined a noisy memorial for Charlie Noakes, who died there and still has not been given the decency of an inquest. The vulnerabilities and innocences of being young and not even knowing what power is. Being exposed. Being in the wrong place. Everywoman has been there. We’d prevent it if we could. We do what we can. But we know the places are there. The wrong places.\nWhat does it feel like to be someone with a story like Jessica’s to tell?\nIt took a moment from falling down that rabbit hole to putting myself in the position of Jessica’s dad. Or her mum. My imagination takes me onto some kitchen floor and in she walks and the story is told. It feels better to have my feet on the ground. I can imagine being either of them. Who would I believe: my daughter or the weird, strangely useful but disappearing hippy?\nThis isn’t about justice or due process. This is about putting yourself into other people’s shoes and imagining what if. Some people can’t do this with their imaginations. Imagination is one of those things which teachers notice you have when you are seven and encourage you to quietly dispose of before you go to secondary school. But I never did that: I can do that: I’ve always been able to do that and I have never understood what it must be like to be one of those people who doesn’t have this skill. I know they exist. They may even be a majority of people. I know it is unusual to be able to imagine and I know also that I’m very very good at that. And that – nothing to do with right or wrong, guilty or innocent, fair or unfair – is why he simply has to resign.\nHe has to resign because we all know that he was apparently not in that sort of relationship – an uneven, manipulative, power over youth – to the people who elected him: that is not how he was elected: that is not the basis on which he was elected. That was neither his image nor his reality. He was just a bright, rather nice ex copper as far as the electorate, his friends, colleagues and neighbours were concerned. Maybe even his family saw nothing more than that.\nIt is possible that even his party colleagues knew no more – but of course this is an awful lot less likely. There is the distinct possibility that they knew a lot more: surely this should have been revealed to two local constituency party’s election agents? Don’t they vet their candidates? What were they told? What did they ask? They have to ask, surely, because of the risks of not asking? He has stood and represented people as a councillor in two constituencies (South Bretton in the Peterborough constituency, then Fletton & Woodston in the North West Cambridgeshire constituency). Why was he moved from one to the other? Two officers of the Conservative Party will presumably have been charged with asking whether or not there is anything in his past which could bring the Conservative Party into disrepute.\nTheir voters might want to know.\nBut now that the story is out, those straightforward people cannot see him in the same way: well perhaps they can. But I can’t. Cllr Holdich can opt to be resolute and refuse to read what is put under his nose. That’s not how I operate. And it is not how a council leader should operate.\nAllegations have to be confronted: they need facing up to\nHoldich has failed to do this to date. Remarkably he has excused Coles anyway even in the event of his being found guilty. He finds what he has been accused of as admirable, necessary. He clearly hasn’t read what the Met concluded about these abuses (see below). Holdich needs to geek up very quickly and consider his position and what the position he is taking says about the position of his entire political party on the issue of #SpyCops, especially given the extraordinary news which broke yesterday (continue reading).\nColes needs to exonerate himself. He needs to be officially exonerated. An explanation is required. And that has so far not happened. He has markedly, signally NOT provided an explanation, a confession, a challenge in whole or in part or a rebuttal. Meanwhile nobody is fighting for or representing Jessica on the City Council, which is going along with the IPCC investigation narrative and tying itself up in confidential tape (which given the Tories allergy to red tape is presumably not red – what colour is it by the way?).\nFor some reason, quite beyond me, Coles believes he can hang on as a city councillor: do this job in the face of a political and media storm and his decision to hang on despite the allegations is what led to the extraordinary but highly effective protest last Wednesday.\nAndy Coles has resigned his post as Deputy Police & Crime Commissioner, and he must now step down from his post as Councillor as well. It is important that the Andy …\nIn her own words: “I welcome the news that Andy Coles has resigned from his post as Cambridgeshire’s Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner. I would like to know …\nColes did resign quickly and in terms of media coverage in a sudden and media-spectacular way from his post as Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner but he did this on the basis that the allegations were getting in the way of him performing the role, not on a point of principle or honour. I noted on Monday 24th July that he had not yet updated his Register of Interests at Peterborough City Council to match that declaration, and I am not sure that the declaration was complete (this would require an audit). I have just submitted a question to full council to find out what exactly what happened when, just in case there is something curious underlying the discrepancy.\nMedia Coverage of Andy Coles’ Resignation from the PCC role is Substantial\nA list is available below the video on this post.\nBackground Story is Credible, Though so far Untested in any Due Process\nThe revelations which led to his resignation can be found as footnotes here: http://undercoverresearch.net/2017/05/12/finding-andy/ Here they are:\nSo if Coles stays, where does this position Peterborough City Council?\nIn failing to suspend Coles, the Leader of Peterborough City Council is placing himself, our council, the Mayor (himself an ex policeman, Cllr John Fox) all our elected councillors and his entire party in the same place as whoever (maybe also members of his party) authorised the #Spycops behaviour in the first place (whether they like it or not, and without a vote). If whoever has power to suspend him from the Conservative Party, did so, pending resolution of whatever processes are or have to take place, then the Leader of Peterborough City Council, our council, our Mayor, all the elected councillors and his entire party could achieve distance from contamination with the behaviours of a group of people who it appear to have been able to abuse state power, in fact were paid to do so, with impunity. The council is contaminated by association until that is achieved. I do not believe this to be in anyone’s best interests.\nYesterday, those abuses widened substantially\nBREAKING: the @ucpinquiry have confirmed that over 1,000 political groups have been spied on since #spycops units were established in 1968.\nThis does not sit well with the proud assertions of our council about democracy diversity and inclusivity, values I believe are shared by city residents.\nBut tonight we learn the firm intention of our council is to exclude the public from its meeting. The local paper has noticed. The council plans to put the public into the Bourges Viersen room which has a fire door between it and the Council Chamber. It is my opinion that putting people behind a fire door (instead of in the Reception Room, which the Mayor clearly alluded to in his remarks on the night – see Cllr Fower’s video below) means that the council is trying to insulate itself from any sound from a Spectators Alternative Containment Room.\nPlease just suspend him. It is reasonable that he is suspended. It is not decent, fair or reasonable that he stays in post while these dreadful allegations remain unresolved.\nPeterborough Green Party supports the continued use of the Spectators Gallery as what it says on this notice:\nSpectators Gallery sign in Peterborough Town Hall showing the way up four flights of stairsand the door leading to it from Bridge Street. #OpenTheDoor (locked last Wednesday).\nPress Coverage of Coles’ resignation from his PCC role\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned following allegations that he deceived … Cambridgeshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner Andy Coles resigns.\nThe allegation relates to Andy Coles‘ work as an undercover police officer in the 1990s. … Cambridgeshire’s deputy PCC resigns over ‘sex deceit’ claim.\nA deputy police and crime commissioner has resigned after being accused of deceiving a woman into a sexual relationship while he was an undercover officer.

It is where the Conservative Party stand the candidates they really don’t want to risk losing. Brian Mawhinney (eventually CON Party Chairman) was MP for Peterborough but was moved to the neighbouring North West Cambridgeshire constituency when Peterborough started to look a bit too risky.\nA “safe” seat presents a number of challenges to residents but also to opposition parties, one of which is that voters who know their vote “doesn’t count” (in terms of securing democratic representation) are inclined to think that their vote “isn’t counted” (but watch this video to see why this is an entirely different thing!).\nIn British Columbia, Canada, Green leader Andrew Weaver agrees a deal with NDP’s John Horgan to end unfair first-past-the-post voting and bring in a proportional system\nHey ho. We are entering the final stages of a general election campaign which looks like cementing our out-of-date two party system in place for at least another five years.\nLabour have failed to put a proportional voting system into its manifesto. Despite calls from many in his party, Jeremy Corbyn has stuck to his script that he does not need it to win, nor does he want it – oh and he can win the Green’s only seat in Brighton. So Labour are asking for your vote on the basis of maintaining the unfair voting system which has given us a majority of “safe seats”, expenses scandals, indifference to voters and all the rest of it.\nA friend suggested on social media that the Greens and the Lib Dem “get behind” the Labour party candidate to ensure that Stewart Jackson is not elected on 8th June. Others keep asking me to “stand down” which I have pointed out once or twice is technically impossible, since the law changed.\nThis is a letter to her and to those making similar comments. I may as well write down my thoughts once and for all, rather than comment individually.\nDear Liza\nWe as Green Party members and officers can and do talk to local LAB members and supporters here in Peterborough and we can sometimes make progress on all kinds of local issues and campaigns. Reasonably constructive local communications contrast starkly with the obstinacy of the LAB party as a national entity, which simply FAILED to talk to the Green Party (nationally or locally) on what could by now have been an amazing Progressive Alliance: perfectly capable of taking the Tories down by utilising all the strengths of FPTP (i.e. only standing one PA opponent – ideally, but if push came to shove, not necessarily, selected by open primaries in each constituency).\nThe Greens have been laying the groundwork for such a Progressive Alliance project since we selected our current leadership team – it was Caroline’s and Jonathan’s joint ticket if you look back – and it was hoped we and other parties might be able to get this in place in time for 2020. This is all very much in the public domain and independent websites have been set up to help enable and explain the processes and help voters understand their local situation and what they can do to help develop a Progressive Alliance and to choose a PA candidate in their own area. Google produces over one million results for “Progressive Alliance UK” and there are now a number of local groups and initiatives. But none, so far, in Peterborough, where the parties we think of as being on the right (or “regressive”) apparently do talk to each other.\nIn order to begin negotiations, Peterborough Greens (including me) were looking for:\n1) LAB step downs in two or more of: Brighton Pavilion, Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Sheffield Central …\n2) actual & meaningful commitments from specific (in our case this means) the selected Peterborough candidate on genuine electoral reform, specifically PR.\nOn the first point The Green Party was not offered a single LAB step down: not in Peterborough and not nationally. This meant that in Peterborough we were in non starter territory, because the electoral maths in the Peterborough borough constituency would have required a joint LIBDEM and a GREEN step down: and it was clearly not worth either of us starting such negotiations if LAB were not going to play ball at all. This was especially true after the Peterborough UKIP stood down (publicly announced on 29th April).\nJust suppose (at the risk of oversimplifying things) that the 2015 Herdman’s 7,400 UKIP voters decided this time to back Jackson. This would bring Jackson’s expected vote up to 26,169 and his majority up to 9,410. Still marginal, but a lot less so.\nOn the second point not only did these conversations not get started in Peterborough, but the LAB candidate selection announcement for Peterborough was made so late that it was highly unlikely that anything resembling a proper conversation could take place. (See the timeline below where you can see there are only nine days to achieve anything.) This very late decision and announcement is incomprehensible to me, given the (debatable) marginality of the seat, but it does very much suggest to me that Peterborough was not on the LAB list of winnable constituencies.\nGoogle me and you will find 82 links just on the topic of electoral reform. Please do your own searches.\nCompare your candidates on any subject online: I am confident I will come out well in any comparison. I work hard and I have a trackable record.\nSo it is perfectly clear that Peterborough Labour and for that matter the Peterborough LibDems are not on the same electoral reform page as the Green Party. And it is the same on a whole range of other policy issues.\nNeither LAB nor LIB DEM needed to split the “progressive vote” by standing a Peterborough candidate. Either or both party could have chosen to back me.\nPeterborough Greens were open to a progressive alliance. The Labour party (as opposed to a number of its members and supporters) clearly wasn’t.\nIf I was an activist inside the LAB party, I’d be asking my leadership to justify their approach to local members and to make sure that it has ditched it in good time for the next GE, preferably on Friday 9th June 2017. But If LAB is really never ever going to contemplate electoral reform, then frankly I’d be jumping ship.\nDespite winning in Peterborough and Cambridge, the overall result was:\nMeanwhile people are voting for the Greens, because we have our very own electorate now and frankly we are better organised than some of our larger and far better financed opponents. We are increasingly effective. And we have been highly influential for quite a while.\nYou can Do a Lot, Elected or Not.\nThe work I have done this year has transformed my relationship with Green Party voters and supporters in my area. I would love every single one of all our supporters’ votes on the 8th June to be cast for me, or if they don’t live in the Peterborough constituency for one of our other excellent Green Party candidates, like Greg or Ruth or Tom. Green votes are already being cast. I don’t want to lose yours Lisa simply because I failed to share my thoughts and maybe help fix a little hole in what could be quite a big bucket.\n“Labour councillors Ansar Ali and Ed Murphy have both said they have put their names forward to represent the party in Peterborough in June’s election, with a decision expected to be made either this week or next.”\n“The only other confirmed candidate for the constituency is Fiona Radic of the Green Party.

This is a new rule! A new form! Nothing stops the unwary voter dropping the ballot into the (rather beautiful) letter box. But all such votes dropped in without a return form will be rejected automatically.\nThe government has added yet another risk to voting postally. There are others, including postal delivery delays (extremely big risk at the moment), rejection of ballot due to signature or date not being matched (very small risk in my opinion, but still a risk), mislaying the pack from the council, theft of the pack or the ballot paper from someone who is vulnerable, someone who is being bullied, or someone who doesn’t understand or care (very big risk indeed).\nIncidentally, it is forbidden for candidates to handle anyone else’s postal packs or ballots. They should only ever handle their own. If a candidate or anyone you don’t trust completely offers to take your vote for you, please report it. You might be experiencing a crime and the council will check it out for you.",

  "http_fionaradic_wordpress_com_/https_fionaradic_wordpress_com_tag_peterborough_page_5/content_707.html": "Neglect of City Centre River Walk on North Embankment of River Nene\nPhotos of the sorry state of collapsed Henry Penn Walk have been posted on Facebook by We Love Peterborough.\nI documented the state of the path in August 2021. You can compare WLP’s recent photo here with mine:\nBut the problem pre dated my first blog on the subject by a long way. There is a closed report on the council’s website, dated 20th October 2020.\nSince I wrote that blog, I’ve been told that the reason nothing has been done to repair the broken path is that Peterborough City Council, (possibly Environment Agency) and one or more developers can’t agree on who owns the path and also that it was built out over the river without planning or any other kind of permission (I’m not sure what the procedure is for building out into a river). As ever I’m happy to be corrected if I have been misinformed this latter point. A slightly different story appeared almost a year ago, when a swift end to the legal tangle, (but apparently not involving the EA) was expected. It suggests that the council agrees it owns the surface of the path. But not its foundations. (Could that happen and if so, how could it have arisen?)\nA legal battle may make it awkward for the parties to it to speak to the press. But two of those parties are funded by the tax payer and the tax payer should be told why a solution and suitable repair could not precede settlement of the case. The costs could be recouped – if necessary – by means of a legal charge on the property. If the path is a property which was built by means of illegal invasion of the river, which seems a bit unlikely, what is the remedy in law? Does an illegal property exist or is it a bit like Schrödinger’s cat? Can a property which should not even be there be compulsorily purchased or confiscated? Can it even have an owner? Could a proper repair cost more than the value of a shoddy property (I’d bet it could). I think we should be told.\nMost unfortunately the council has set an awful precedent in Park Ward, where a drain it was given by Peterborough Development Corporation was built out into by a neighbouring property owner and a hideous building was given retrospective planning permission. So the council has established a flabby attitude to allowing people to develop beyond their own boundaries and into its watery properties (not something I condone or recommend).\nBut even if the story I was told holds water, it should be possible to find out who built a path on the bank capable of being washed away. While the flats were under construction, the whole site was fenced off, so the general public would not have been able to see anything. Is the organisation which built a soluble embankment still in business?\nIt should be possible to establish the position of the river bank before and after the flats were built. It should be possible to find out how many building regulations checks were performed as the flats were built and whether or not the rogue path was spotted or anything done about it during the flats’ construction. This is something the council’s planning department should be able to establish. I don’t have photographs. But someone must have some.\nI’ve been assured that no danger is posed to the buildings, but even if this is true, it is not the impression given by the landscaping: the dodgy path appears to have been held up by a steel retaining wall which has very definitely failed. It isn’t clear to the casual passer by (even if it is to the council’s structural engineering expert) what is holding the flats up. If the council’s building inspectors missed a dodgy retaining wall, can we be sure that they checked the one which may or may not be behind the dodgy one and which may or not be holding the embankment under the flats in place?\nThe path poses obvious hazards to pedestrians and cyclists and has, rightly, been closed. However repairs to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, even in Central Ward in Peterborough does not carry the priority it would if the route happened to carry cars. This despite the fact that the path is on the tourist trail. Peterborough remains a car crazy city and unattractive damage to the north bank river path persists apparently unnoticed by the city’s elected members. Voters should note that Cllr Jamil’s current term of office ends in May.",

But if your preference happens to be for a different party which has a history of not getting a proportionate number of candidates elected per votes cast, then this is for you too.\nEvery general election Green voters are bombarded with messages to vote for another party. Teams of people argue why on social media. Every general election is special for some unique reason and so, just this once, voters need to vote for someone they don’t really like, because the candidate/party they don’t really like happens to be less objectionable than the candidate most likely to win. So this year, in 2019, this Thursday, this general election is special because we are told that we are not really voting for our own area’s candidates on the ballot paper at all: we are voting for or against “Brexit”. The two main parties principal messages are about their opposite leader (as if that really made a difference outside their constituencies).\nEven people who are not absorbed in the detail know this is not OK.\nIf you live in a safe constituency\nIf the last winning majority was, say, over 2,000 votes, you can vote for your favourite candidate full stop.\nThis is because how you vote simply won’t make any difference to the result.\nIf you live in a marginal\nYou might have to think rather more carefully. But of course 2,000 is just a random number. There are levels of marginality and you need to decide where to draw the line in your constituency. Go here to see the effect of marginality across the country and in your area.\nIf you want to vote tactically\nYou also need to understand why you are doing it. People who are not sufficiently well informed are highly vulnerable to manipulation and misdirection. Check what you believe is true. Check your own reasoning:\n-\n- Are you wanting to stop the Tories?\n- Are you wanting to ensure the UK remains in the EU?\nDepending on what your objective is, a tactical vote might or might not make sense. Here is a comparison, on one tactical voting website, of other websites. However, it makes no sense to simply take any website’s advice. Who runs the site and why are they putting time and resources into it? Which organisations run or promote them? What is motivating them?\nBut let us suppose that despite doing all of the above a tactical vote or voting for your favourite party are still options for you.\nWhich to choose? How to decide? What are the ramifications?\n-\n- Could you really tip the result?\n- How does your tactical option benefit the party which gets your tactical vote?\n- How does your decision not to vote with your heart affect the party you really love?\nIs it really only about one vote this time?\nAre you happy to deprive your favourite party of:\n-\n- encouragement\n- support\n- finance – they may lose future income in the form of “short money”\n- their deposit (£500 per constituency is only returned by the government to candidates who win over 5% of votes cast)\nThe UK voting system needs reform so that people are free to make a genuine vote rather than a so called tactical one.\nOne tactical vote or two million tactical votes will not fix broken First Past The Post. It doesn’t matter how well informed your vote is: how crafty you are. On your own you can’t stop people being misled by people who benefit from people being misled any more than I can. (But you could share this post.)\nNeither The Labour Party nor The Conservative & Unionist Party are interested in any form of voting system reform. If you vote for either of them you are supporting and entrenching the problematic First Past The Post voting system. It makes no sense at all to vote tactically to benefit either of them.\nThe deposit system was brought in to deter candidates who were not serious. What The Green Party stands for should not cost us so much, but while it still does, we need all the votes we can get.\nIn conclusion\n-\n- Vote Green on Thursday\n- Donate to us to keep us standing and communicating\n- Thank you for reading so far.

This is despite the well established truth that more lanes only ever mean more traffic. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper to reschedule commutes and listen to the experiences of others who came to regret making similar mistakes and to those who have deconstructed infrastructure which they eventually realised didn’t make lives better?\nLike Northstowe near Cambridge, where a huge area turned out to have been settled, land around Castor, Ailsworth and Wansford is already known to be packed with Roman archaeological sites (hint “Castor”), mostly now under the plough or scrub.\nThis is especially true at the Wansford end of the stretch, where the existing road was built along the edge of a cliff of solid rock (underlying Sacrewell Farm for example) to the north and very deep mud sloping away to the south and and down towards the Nene river which has been gently biting into land on its north bank and building multiple ox bow lakes on its south. Roman settlements and burial sites lie on the north side of the current roadway and some are scheduled ancient monuments, which should award them protection.\nThe people who built the existing road cleverly squeezed its foundations into the narrow corridor between geology and history.\nBuilding into metres of sludge, fen, slippery clay or mud is always fantastically expensive, even if it is a uniquely favoured form of public spending across Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Contiguous constituencies’ MPs and Peterborough’s ex MP’s united enthusiasm for this project indicates to me that this form of spending does much to get politicians elected simply because all they need to do is rely upon the irritation of frustrated drivers.\nDigging up treasures is never cheap. And in this case it isn’t necessary.\nIt would have been better and I believe it would still be better\nLast time I used the Wansford junction double roundabout, a sign post had apparently suffered a collision with a moving object and was lying prostrate and there was also a massive pothole lying in wait to break the axles of vehicles joining the A47.\nTwo big problems at a location heavily populated with people trained to build and maintain roads.\nWhat a mess. It would be ridiculous, if it weren’t also dangerous.\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding non PCC residents from using “our” Household Recycling Facility!\nHave you lobbied your councillors on your preferences? Do you have enough information to have an opinion on where new unitary authority boundaries should lie? Do you know of a Peterborough event where this reorganisation will be considered?\nQuite topical really, given the recent hyper insular approach of Peterborough City Council when it comes to excluding Yaxley (Huntingdonshire District Council) and Whittlesey (Fenland District Council) residents from using their nearest (surely?) but “our” Household Recycling Facility!\na good budget requires highly effective team work\nThis meeting was live-streamed here. It began at 6pm.\nThe absence of ten councillors for the budget meeting is concerning. It is a high percentage. My very best wishes to Mayor Marco Cereste who has had a major health shock, and to his family. One councillor was legally prohibited from attending, pending a court appearance, but was able to ask a question from a remote location. I am very happy to live in a country where laws are respected and those who understand how best to implement them are able to do so. Hats off to officers for working to demonstrate a never before observed (by me, at any rate) example of inclusion.\nElected representatives who ABSTAIN on a budget might be expressing frustration or unhappiness, which, however genuinely felt, are emotions of no practical use to the residents they were elected to serve. Where the budget is concerned, it is irresponsible, because a good budget requires effective team work.\nThere is a point in voting AGAINST a budget. But to vote usefully AGAINST a budget, you must have done your homework and have another “alternative” budget up your sleeve. And you must also have the support of other elected representatives, so that you can be confident that it stands a chance of being supported if presented. In order to reach this point, you will have been conscientious and have done your basic preparatory work. You could then vote AGAINST the budget presented by the administration of the government (in this case a council) with a clean conscience, because you have built a better option. When the administration’s proposed budget falls to pass, you can then present your alternative budget. This might be just what the people who elected you need you to do.\nYou can see the breakdown of votes and who said what here.\nPeterborough’s unitary government in recent years has too often featured two sides sneering at each other’s ideas and policies and individuals not listening to good alternative policies simply because they originate from outside their own hard baked ideology (a classic example was the destruction of the local 20’s Plenty campaign, achieved by kicking a worthwhile project into the long grass of a “pilot project” and then those who kicked it never brought the results of that project back to council). Neither side treated the other with respect and some councillors reveal as soon as they open their mouths that they haven’t read the agenda papers and that they aren’t bothering to acquire the essential analytical skill sets. The independent panel seems to have helped sort this out.\nHowever there is still some bad behaviour. During council meetings, councillors are frequently talking to their electorate in the council chamber and putting themselves onto social media. Councillor Nicola Day even took a team selfie during the meeting. Some appear to struggle to put their phone down and are constantly watching their phones while on a livestream. They embarrass Peterborough and its residents. It should be possible for councillors to switch their phones off during a meeting: it is professional to do so and it is simply good manners to give your full attention to the agenda and to your colleagues in a meeting.\nThe passage of the council’s budget on Wednesday was too tight for comfort, but compared with recent years, it was a welcome moment of calm organisation. I congratulate all those who worked constructively with Councillor Mohammed Jamil, Cabinet Member for Finance & Corporate Governance, whose approach has been consultative and consensual, to contribute to it and to vote for it. Hats off especially to Councillor Dennis Jones and to Councillor Wayne Fitzgerald. Without their closing speeches, their clarity and eloquence, this might not have passed and I strongly suspect that there was no superior alternative budget waiting in the wings. Passing any kind of workable budget in this era of badly managed economic decline (Westminster has never ended the “Austerity”) is nothing short of miraculous. I had high hopes for a new Labour government, but so far it has disappointed.\nWe have yet to see what happens as the independent supervisory panel finally walks away.\nThe council had leverage at that point. It needed to act when the residential developer was ready to rent or sell.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nfor me, it was a jaw on floor moment\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\n.. the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too ..\nAt 08:15 (once the programme ends) Just elected Paul Waugh MP (of all people!) describes, (as only a highly articulate, politically savvy and most importantly an experienced journalist could) what was going on there. I recognised his description as applicable to events in Peterborough. If I hadn’t seen the things he describes also happening here with my own eyes, I’d have struggled to believe a word of his account.\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0020xhh\nA side observation is that Labour couldn’t have picked a better or more articulate candidate for this seat. The party may have twigged that its entire future (and crucially its next term) depends on the quality of its selection processes and maybe even the relevance of a particular person to the specific needs of a constituency.\nOr, it is equally possible that his selection was largely a happy accident: the non member public has no way whatsoever of knowing what happens inside a political party’s selection processes.\nOdd really: because the public has been led to believe that parties can be trusted to select good candidates and that selection hinges upon some basic standards. I think that the last eight years have blown away a lot of false assumptions about this, certainly inside political parties, and possibly outside them too.\nThursday was a political earthquake and in order to face the entirely new political reality established by voters in July 2024, the future of any party now hinges ever so much more than it used to on the robustness, quality and relevance of its selection processes.\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nSt Johns Church is holding a General Election Hustings\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.\nIs a bad portrait worse than no portrait at all?\nSubscribe to get access to the rest of this post and other subscriber-only content.",

Sit them down after they’ve had a good meal and read it as gently and softly as you can. Just before bed with the lights down. Don’t forget right at the end of this absolutely terrible story, to remind them that they are not allowed to vote for a change of government until they turn 18. But they can register to vote to change matters they disapprove of as soon as they turn 17.\nYour children might react by telling you not to be so silly, close their eyes and sleep, much as so often happens when you read one of the ghastliest and grimmest of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nBut if they sit up and protest against your bedtime story, here is how to suggest that they run a poll at their school. Younger doubters may ask for another story: this can’t after all, be how it all ends? Maybe an Adventure is in order? Or a Game? Tomorrow night, then.\nChildren can always run a Poll\nAt their School, Club in the Family or anywhere where there are three or more people who can be persuaded to join in. They will need to appoint an Electoral Returning Officer to run a Poll or even an Internal Election. A boring school would appoint a teacher to this role. But this would avoid about two weeks work for a whole school who could Research, Discuss, Decide and Vote on making their own Elected Officer or Appointment (could be either) from within the class (for a class poll) or a school (for a school wide poll). They’d also need to Decide (and how to do that) whether or not they can Vote in an Assembly (like Parliament) or whether they need a full scale Election, in which case they would need to Design and Manufacture their own Poll Cards, Ballot Boxes and Confidential Polling Booths, Specify the Dates and Times the Booths would be open and then Decide how to Organise the Count: Appoint Polling Staff, Appoint Counting Staff. They’d also have to Decide on the Definition of the Electorate (or determine an Electoral Boundary) and whether or not they need to Register Eligible Voters on an Electoral Register. Oh yes, they’d have to Decide on a Wording to be put on the Ballot and whether or not more than one Vote can be taken and if so, how. And whether or not a Simple Majority is the best Voting Strategy.\nThey could each run a Vote Count to find out who or what Motion has won the Poll. Offences Detected and Offences Not Detected could also be counted, by each of the smaller teams.\nTo make this slightly less deadly (nobody is pretending all this is super exciting!) for older and very bright students, maybe those with lively imaginations and career options including Crime Writer, you could have one small additional group working in a Vote Fraud Team (their Objective could be to Manipulate the Vote by whatever Illegal Means they can Concoct) and another small additional group working as an Electoral Police, working to Detect Electoral Offences. This is not recommended for children under the age of 14, who generally adhere to the Right and Wrong Theory of Everything.\nParticipants who don’t understand the Capitalised Words (there are even a couple in this Post’s Heading!) will find them Defined in Wikipedia.\nCould two weeks out of the UK’s child’s interminably long school career getting up to all this (even if all had to be done during play and lunch time) be better spent?\nWell, Arguably they could. Because a teacher who asks a class to Vote FOR or AGAINST an idea by asking for a Show of Hands can run a Poll in about forty seconds flat. Although, of course, that hyper efficient teacher’s class may never grasp the finer points of how elections are run (and policed) by UK governments and UK law enforcement.\nSurely Santa is self employed and could apply for a different type of visa? But if he hasn’t done it yet then Christmas will be delayed until at least early March before his visa is granted! With Easter being in late March in 2024 (is the Easter Bunny a UK resident?) there’s the potential for a joint enterprise with Christmas eggs being on the menu?!\nLikeLike",
