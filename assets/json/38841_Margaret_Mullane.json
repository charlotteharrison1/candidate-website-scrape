My name is Margaret Mullane, and I am your MP for Dagenham & Rainham.\nIt hasn’t always been a life of politics for me. I am proud to have managed the office of Jon Cruddas MP for thirteen years, but prior to this I worked in insurance, and in a call centre, and was previously a barmaid at the Dagenham Trades Hall. I understand just how precarious work can be for people in areas like ours. That is why I am an active trade unionist.\nDagenham & Rainham has a proud heritage, and it is important that we maintain a strong identity. I plan to lead from the front and am fiercely proud of our constituency. Local people know me. They know I will always put them first.\nAs your MP I will champion council housing as I have always done, use my experience as a Council Cabinet Member to hold the police to account and tackle crime in the constituency, and offer a new model of politics for the area, putting the community at its heart.\nMy Experience\n15\nYears as CLP Secretary\n14\nSuccessful Elections\nYears as a Labour Councillor\n12\n4\nYears as Cabinet Member for Community Safety\n15\nYears Work in a Parliamentary Office\nLocal Government Association Mentor"
