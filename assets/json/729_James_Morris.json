That’s why a key part of my six-point plan for Halesowen & Rowley Regis is to improve our local transport links.\nOver the past few months, many drivers have been driven potty by potholes, and my team and I have reported a large number to Dudley and Sandwell Councils. I welcome that the Government are investing £8.3bn to fix the blight of potholes, enough to resurface over 5,000 miles of roads in England, which is in addition to over £5bn invested since the start of this Parliament on highway maintenance investment.\nMany people rely on our local buses, and when a route is threatened with being withdrawn it causes considerable concern for users. When the 002 service, which runs from Weoley Castle to Merry Hill, was in danger of being axed last year, I supported a petition from local Councillor Stuart Henley and worked with West Midlands Mayor Andy Street, to encourage Diamond Bus to rethink their proposals.\nLast year, many residents living on or around Station Road in Old Hill raised concerns with me about the length of time roadworks were taking, following structural repairs. Whilst we all accept that necessary roadworks are going to cause some delay and disruption, the length of time was causing real angst. Following pressure on Sandwell Council, I urged for the works to be concluded speedily, and whilst I appreciate there may be some disruption at times, I am pleased that traffic has now been able to pass through.\nI will keep fighting for better connectivity and transport links, ensuring that we can all get around safely and smoothly.\nThis article first appeared in the Halesowen & Dudley News on 18th April 2024.",

Garry delivers sessions alongside his daughter Natalie and other instructors, with classes for both adults and children.\nJames and Andy had the opportunity to meet the instructors, parents and students from HKA, and watch the students put through their paces.\n“I certainly wouldn’t want to get on the wrong side of these young kickboxers, they certainly seemed quite fearsome, and I was very impressed by their punching and kicking prowess!\", said James. “The Academy has been running for over 30 years, and I pay tribute to Garry for the hours he spends each week, as well as his colleagues, passing on their skills, knowledge and expertise to the next generation of kickboxers. It’s a great opportunity for them to make new friends, keep fit and improve their confidence.\n“I want to thank everyone for making Andy and I welcome, and I wish all the students well in whatever belt they are working towards.”\nGarry Hickman, Founder and Chief Executive of HKA, added, “Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street and James Morris MP came to visit Hickman’s Kickboxing Academy last week. We’ve been training at Ormiston for over 25 years and I’ve been in martial arts for over 50 years, and the club is run by the family for families.\n“Andy and James were keen to hear about the club, chatting with the parents and students, and their visit was a great confidence boost for all the students who were there on Friday.”",

I’ll continue working to ensure our area gets its fair share of Police resources, to help residents and businesses feel safe.\nDuring my time as an MP there were various plans for the closure of Halesowen Police Station, which I know often causes concern for residents and businesses. I will always fight to ensure that the town has a physical Police presence. When proposals were set out in 2021 to merge the station into a new super-station in Dudley, I launched a petition which was signed by over 600 residents and then handed it in at the offices of the West Midlands Police & Crime Commissioner.\nIn areas that have been blighted by anti-social behaviour I have held meetings to bring residents, local Councillors and Police Officers together, and to agree a plan of action. I have also supported bids by the four Black Country Councils in their efforts to secure an injunction against street racing, and I was delighted when the High Court granted a full injunction in February 2024.",

I’ve been working with the Friends of the Leasowes Council and Dudley Council to bring about plans for a new cafe, toilets and a visitor centre that the park is worthy of.\nParks and green spaces are important for both physical and mental health, as well as the protection of local habitats, and across all areas of our constituency I am working to ensure that they are safe, clean, accessible and able to be enjoyed by people of all ages.",

I also worked as Chief Executive of Localis, a local government think tank, where we worked to produce ideas to give local people more of a say over how decisions made by local and national governments affect them. I regularly use the experiences I gained before 2010 to help me understand the challenges of local people and businesses and think about how I can best support them.\nDuring my time as an MP I regularly hosted Jobs & Skills Fairs in Halesowen & Rowley Regis, bringing together local employers and training providers to boost employment prospects for local people. I also championed better support for mental health and have hosted roundtable meetings with providers to see how the support provided can be extended and improved. I joined in with many community projects including litter picks and clean up events, and I ran surgeries in the constituency, to talk to local people about the challenges they are facing and seeing where I can help.\nI have also previously sat on the Communities & Local Government Select Committee, chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Mental Health, and represented the Lords & Commons Cricket Team against other Parliaments. I held several roles as a Parliamentary aide to ministers and spent 18 months as a Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party. As part of my interest in mental health, I have argued for increased funding and a greater ‘parity’ between mental and physical health care, as well as arguing for reform of the Mental Health Act.\nIn 2019 I was invited to serve as a Government Whip, helping to ensure our legislative programme is delivered. Between 2021 and 2022 I was additionally the ‘Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household’, a senior position within the Whips Office which involved keeping Her Late Majesty The Queen updated on House of Commons proceedings. As part of the ceremonial duties with the role, I was ‘held hostage’ at Buckingham Palace during the 2022 State Opening of Parliament, a custom that dates back to the Civil War to ensure the safe return of the sovereign. I also had the privilege of attending a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral for the Queen during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June 2022.\nBetween July and September 2022 I served as a Minister at the Department of Health & Social Care, with the title of ‘Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Primary Care and Patient Safety’. The role was a regular reminder of the great NHS that we are fortunate to have, and during my time as an MP I met many dedicated doctors, nurses and healthcare staff who have an inspiring commitment to public service.\nFrom October 2022 to May 2024 I served on the Health & Social Care Select Committee, where our role was to provide an objective scrutiny of the work of the Department of Health & Social Care and keep Ministers and officials accountable. I also chaired two APPG’s - one for Shakespeare and one for Cyber Security, two areas where I have keen interests. However, my most important role in Parliament was to bang the drum for Halesowen & Rowley Regis, and help secure jobs, investment and better standards for schools and hospitals.\nAway from politics, I am married to Anna and we have two children, Sol and Evie. I have a keen interest in cricket and enjoy the theatre, reading and running. I ran the London Marathon in 2018 and 2019 to raise money for Halas Homes and Ups and Downs respectively, two local charities.",

Since 2019 an extra 20,000 officers have been recruited across England and Wales, and I’ll fight to ensure that our area has its fair share.\nCar cruising along the A456 has also been a persistent issue, causing misery for those who live nearby. Over the last few years, I have brought residents, Councillors and Police Officers together, as well as supporting the four Black Country Councils in their work to secure High Court injunctions against street racing. I have also met with the Policing Minister to highlight the need for a specific law to tackle this issue, given that repeatedly having to secure injunctions can be expensive.\nI will continue working to ensure that residents and businesses feel safe, ensure that their concerns are listened to and fight for action when lives and livelihoods are caused misery.\nThis article first appeared in the Halesowen & Dudley News on 16th May 2024.",

Dangerous drivers will congregate and drive up and down Manor Way at high speeds and pull off stunts, not just causing noise pollution for those living nearby but also putting themselves at risk and risking the lives of those using the road responsibly.\nThe issue was particularly bad during lockdown when the roads were quieter, but unfortunately, we’ve seen repeated instances over the summer and early autumn.\nAs an MP, I’ve always believed that bringing residents together and letting them air their views to those in authority is the best way to get an issue resolved. That’s why I’ve been meeting with them, local Councillors, Police officers and Council officials to urge the need for action, as well as writing an open letter to the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police.\nI welcome the arrests that have been made recently as part of ‘Operation Hercules’, the dedicated response from West Midlands Police to tackle car cruising, and I welcome the liaison that is ongoing between the force and the local authority to install a camera on the A456 to make it easier to track the vehicles involved.\nCar cruising has been an issue across the Black Country too, and recently I teamed up with my colleague Nicola Richards, MP for West Bromwich East, to meet with the Policing Minister Chris Philp and make the case for updating legislation to make life easier for Police, At the moment they are relying on injunctions from the High Court, which are temporary and can be costly and bureaucratic to keep having to renew.\nIf you live near the A456 and have been experiencing these issues, then please do get in touch with me at [email protected], and if you do manage to obtain any photographic or video evidence then please forward it on to the Police.\nThis article first appeared in the Halesowen & Dudley News on 12th October 2023.",

Over 40 employers and training providers were in attendance, and it was interesting to hear about the opportunities they were offering.\nI’ve also been involved in discussions recently about two exciting new projects that are going to boost educational provision in our area – a Sandwell College Satellite Education Hub for Cradley Heath, and a new site for adult learning in Halesowen, provided by the College. These have been made possible by central Government investment, through the Towns Fund and Levelling Up Fund respectively.\nI will keep doing what I can to ensure that Halesowen & Rowley Regis is a great place to work and train and ensuring that local job creation can help to grow our local economy.\nThis article first appeared in the Halesowen & Dudley News on 14th March 2024.",
  "https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_/https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_campaigns_more-choice-and-better-services-our-local-nhs/content_11.html": "Our NHS has served us for over 75 years, with universal healthcare free at the point of use, I’ll continue to fight for our local services in the current challenges they face. I also have a strong interest in mental health treatment, improving access to services and ensuring it has parity with physical health, and I am working to ensure patients have access to the treatments and services they require.\nDuring my first term as an MP I encouraged the Government to invest in a new hospital for Sandwell, and on several occasions I visited the site of the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital in Smethwick. Despite setbacks during the construction, I am pleased that it is now on course to open in 2024, offering acute and emergency care for many people across the region.\nIn 2023 and 2024, many constituents raised concerns with me about issues in accessing appointments at the Regis Medical Centre in Blackheath. I raised these issues with the surgery and with the Health Secretary in the House of Commons.\nThe role of local pharmacies is important, particularly in light of the new ‘Pharmacy First’ scheme whereby pharmacists can treat more conditions without the need for referral from a GP. In February 2024 I visited Halesowen Pharmacy to discuss these changes and to see how patients and pharmacies are benefitting.",
  "https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_/https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_news_wishing-hm-king-speedy-recovery/content_25.html": "I’m sure many of us will have been saddened to hear the news recently that His Majesty the King has been diagnosed with cancer.\nThe news comes after he had already undergone treatment for benign prostate enlargement, and during a time when the Princess of Wales has also been undergoing abdominal surgery. It is a concerning time for all the Royal Family, and I’m sure that everyone’s thoughts and prayers will be with them.\nWhilst the King has had to take a break from his public duties, I am pleased to hear that he is still able to fulfil his constitutional commitments. Whilst the UK is a Parliamentary democracy, the Crown plays an important, if at times largely symbolic role, in our legal and political system. Our history, traditions and constitutional quirks are revered globally, and make us proud to be British. The good wishes that have poured in for the King from around the world are a recognition of the high esteem in which he and his family are held by many.\nTraditionally the Royal Family may have chosen to stay tight-lipped when it comes to health issues, but I think it is welcome that the King has chosen to be open about his issues, in the hope it will encourage others with symptoms to get treated. Benign prostate enlargement is common in men aged over 50, and whilst it is not usually a serious threat to health, it is advisable to get it treated.\nWhen it comes to cancer, every family will have been affected in some way, and whilst the search for a cure continues we do know that the earlier a cancer is detected, the greater the chances of survival. Again, I would strongly encourage anyone who may have symptoms to get them checked out, to give peace of mind for yourself and your loved ones, and getting the ball rolling early on treatment if required.\nThis article first appeared in the Halesowen & Dudley News on 8th February 2024.",
  "https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_/https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_news_merry-christmas-james-1/content_10.html": "Over the past few weeks I’ve been getting into the festive spirit in Halesowen & Rowley Regis, attending lights switch-ons and Christmas fayres across the constituency as we countdown to the big day. It’s a busy time of year but also a special one too, and I’m sure like me and my family, you’ll be busy with your own preparations.\nThe end of the year offers a time for reflection, an opportunity to look back at what we’ve done over the last twelve months, and the memorable moments that we will always remember. For many of us, the coronation of King Charles III in May, the first time most of us had witnessed such an occasion, will be an event that lives long in the memory.\nI’ve enjoyed getting out and about across the constituency in 2023, and it was a delight to be at the Grove in April to watch Halesowen Town clinch promotion to the Southern League Premier Division. Amongst other highlights this year, I hosted a jobs fair in the Cornbow Centre and a Macmillan Coffee Morning, attended the opening of the new offices for Sandvik Coromant, inspected progress at the Midlands University Metropolitan Hospital, visited Cradley Heath mosque and attended the 100th anniversary celebrations for the Royal British Legion’s Blackheath branch.\nWith the new constituency boundaries that will be in place at the next General Election, I’ve also enjoyed being out and about and meeting new people across Cradley, Wollescote, Quarry Bank and Dudley Wood.\nI recognise that for some people the cost of living is still an ongoing challenge, and that events across the world will cause nervousness for some as we head towards a new year. Christmas offers us the chance to be grateful for what we have, and a reminder of those who are most important to us. Whilst this season may mean different things to different people, there is always something to be thankful for and celebrate.\nHowever you are spending it this year, I wish you all a very Merry Christmas.",
  "https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_/https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_news_we-will-remember-them/content_13.html": "Later this month I will join others across our country and across the Commonwealth, as we remember all those who have sacrificed their lives in conflict to ensure we enjoy the freedoms and liberties we have today.\nThe first ever Remembrance Day took place on 11th November 1919, one year after the end of the First World War. After the Second World War, the Government introduced ‘Remembrance Sunday’ on the second Sunday of November as the main day of commemorations, although many people will observe a two minutes’ silence on both. I know it is a particularly solemn occasion for those who have lost loved ones in conflict, who will remember their service with both pride and with sadness.\nEvery year on remembrance weekend myself and my wife Anna between us attend the commemorations across Halesowen & Rowley Regis, and once again this year we will also be joining Voices in Harmony for their Concert of Remembrance at Holy Trinity Church in Old Hill.\nWhilst older generations may still have recollections of living through the Second World War, with rationing, ariel bombardment and a real threat to the independence and sovereignty of Britain, for many of us it is all too easy to take the freedom we enjoy today for granted. We only need look at what the Ukrainian people have endured for nearly two years, or the plight that has affected Israel and Gaza over the last few weeks, for a reminder that the threat to our way of life could come when it’s least expected.\nThe remembrance weekend is also a good opportunity to remember the work currently being undertaken by our armed forces, who not only defend our country but also work to provide humanitarian support where it is needed and promote the UK’s influence across the world. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those who have served in the past and to those who serve today, and for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, we will remember them.\nThis article first appeared in the Halesowen & Dudley News on 9th November 2023.",
  "https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_/https_www_jamesmorris_co_uk_news_james-makes-new-furry-friends-visit-little-learning-barn/content_2.html": "James visited the Little Learning Barn at St Margaret’s Meadow Farm in Halesowen on Friday (6th April), where he had an opportunity to meet director Laura Littlewood and the animals on site.\nLaura has over 20 years of experience of working with adults with learning difficulties and mental health issues, and with her love of animals she began volunteering at St Margaret's Meadow Farm CIC, before renting from the farm to start her own venture.\nThe Little Learning Barn runs parent and toddler groups and SEND sessions to help those with learning difficulties and mental health issues, giving them an opportunity to get up lose to the animals in a safe environment. Sessions include opportunities to stroke and cuddle the animals, as well as feeding them and putting them to bed and getting involved in other farmyard chores.\nAnimals at the farm, which is just off the A456 in Halesowen, include rabbits, goats, pigs, alpacas and donkeys, and James had the opportunity to meet them, feed them and give them a fuss!\n“I want to thank Laura for showing me round the Little Learning Barn and introducing me to all the animals. It was great fun, and they were all so well behaved for me!\", said James.\n“Spending time on a farmyard and learning new skills to look after animals is great for those with SEND or struggling with mental health issues, in a calmer and quieter environment. It’s a fantastic venture and real asset for SEND and mental health provision in our town, and I’d encourage those who have someone in their care who could benefit to check out their website.”\nLaura Littlewood, Director of the Little Learning Barn, added, “Little Learning Barn supports young children and those with SEND as it gives a safe space away from the general public where families feel safe and valued. Animals can be very therapeutic to the children that visit, often making them feel calmer and bringing out their confidence. It was great to have James with us to show him round and talk about what we do.”",

They have moved into a purpose-built HQ with a high-tech innovation centre on Manor Way, and thanks to a £5m investment from the West Midlands Combined Authority, their old site next door has been demolished to make way for housing on brownfield land.\nThe company has been based in Halesowen since the 1950s, and supplies the town’s Christmas tree as well as supporting Halesowen in Bloom and sponsoring Halesowen Town FC.\n“Having Sandvik Coromant in Halesowen is a real asset for our town, it was a pleasure to be at the official opening of their HQ last year and it was great for Andy to see the new headquarters for himself\", aid James.\n“Sandvik play a big role in the town’s civic life, and the move to the new headquarters has freed up a 5.6-acre brownfield site for new housing, with the Combined Authority’s support. Building here helps to protect the green belt on the opposite site of Manor Way, and I look forward to the completion of this development.”",
