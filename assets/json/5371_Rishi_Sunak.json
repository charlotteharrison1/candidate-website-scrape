Data Controller\nThe Data Controller is Rishi Sunak\n2. Contact\nIf you have any questions about this policy or for more information about how we use your data or would like to exercise any of your rights contact Rishi Sunak.\n3. Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Rishi Sunak, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data. The Register of Electors that councils provide to authorised persons under the Representation of the People Act is also used for electoral purposes.\n5.

We ensure that our service providers comply with the same high standard that we do, and we store our data on the Bluetree servers in the UK.\n6. Special category data\nSpecial category data will be processed under the lawful basis indicated in section 3, as is permitted in clauses 22, 23 and 24 of schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act, covering political parties and elected representatives.\n7. Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Some service providers are located outside of the EEA and therefore it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. Where the transfer of your data outside of the EEA takes place we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if the data was inside the EEA, and it only occurs with your consent.\nWe will use one of the following safeguards to ensure this:\n• Where the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision determining that a non-EEA country or organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection.\n• A contract is put in place with the recipient of the data obliging them to protect the data to the same standards as the EEA.\nLegally it is not permitted to transfer certain types of data, such as Electoral Register Data, outside of the EEA, and we honour that obligation.\n8. Data retention policy\nPersonal data will be held for no longer than necessary. Some types of data may be held for longer than others. Typically the maximum retention is two election cycles. Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10. Will we share your data with anyone else?\nIf you have contacted us about a personal or policy issue, your data may be passed on to a third-party in the course of dealing with your enquiry, such as local authorities, government agencies, public bodies, health trusts, regulators, and so on. Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.

You have the right to complain.\n12. Making a complaint\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

  "http_www_rishisunak_com_/http_www_rishisunak_com_news_rishi-opens-special-needs-disabled-toilet-leyburn/content_8.html": "Rishi has opened a Changing Places toilet for severely disabled people in Leyburn – part funded by a Government grant scheme he set up.\nThe MP cut a ribbon to formally declare the toilet – in the town’s main car park – open.\nThe new Leyburn facility was made possible by the town council and local businesswoman Diane Howarth who are working on a wider project – Creating Accessible Leyburn – to make the town more accessible for all disabled people.\nThey accessed a £30.5m grant scheme to help fund Changing Places toilets Rishi established when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2021.\nChanging Places toilets are larger than standard disabled toilets and have extra equipment like adult-sized changing benches and hoists to assist a severely disabled person’s carers.\nRishi said the toilet was designed for people with complex care needs who cannot use a standard ‘disabled toilet’ and are usually accompanied by one or more carers.\nHe said he was first made aware of the lack of changing facilities for the severely disabled when visiting the Dales School at Morton on Swale in 2018. Parents told him of the indignities and the health and safety issues they faced when trying to change their loved ones on a toilet floor.\nThe lack of adequate Changing Places toilets meant many families found it impossible to plan the simplest day away from home.\nRishi said: “I am gratified to see a Changing Places toilet in Leyburn part-funded by the scheme I was proud to establish when in Government. I applaud the work of Diane and the town council in bringing it together and their wider efforts to make Leyburn a better place for the disabled to live and visit.”\nMrs Howarth, who owns a local award-winning holiday cottage business which includes an accessible cottage, said: “This facility is designed for people with complex care needs who cannot use a standard ‘disabled toilet’ and are usually accompanied by one or more carers.\n“Without a Changing Places toilet, the disabled person is put at risk, and families are forced to risk their own health and safety by changing their loved one on a toilet floor. This is dangerous, unhygienic and undignified.\nAccessibility Consultant Gillian Scotford of AccessibleUK was among the project partners who attended the opening. She said: “As a mum of three children, two with severe disabilities, I know how a day out or holiday must be carefully planned.\n“My son Thomas, who died in 2017, needed Changing Places toilets, but in his 21 years we never had an opportunity to use one, because there was very few in the country.\n“In 2021, Rishi, then Chancellor, announced over £30m funding to deliver more Changing Places Toilets across the UK.\n“I remember the day the news broke, and it made me cry. It was the first time any Government Minister had given understanding, empathy and recognition to the struggles faced by so many families with loved ones with complex needs, whose toileting needs cannot be met with a standard accessible toilet. The opening of Changing Places Toilets is a huge step in boosting accessible tourism.”\nMrs Howarth, who runs an award-winning holiday cottage business in Bishopdale, near Leyburn, said she first discussed the Accessible Leyburn project with the town council in 2021.\nFormally launched this spring, the project aims to improve accessibility in Leyburn for the local community and visitors, not just for wheelchair users, but for a range of physical and hidden disabilities, elderly, children and of all ages.\nAs well as delivering the Changing Places toilet, the project is carrying out an audit of the public realm, the facilities, businesses and attractions in Leyburn, to communicate what is accessible across the town, thereby enabling visitors and the community to make an informed decision as to where they can visit.\nAnother element of the project has been the inclusion of accessible equipment in the recent refurbishment of The Shawl’s play area.\nThe Accessible Leyburn project is being funded by the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, the Government-funded and North Yorkshire Council-administered UK Shared Prosperity Fund, the UK Lottery Fund and the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust."
