I will maintain an accessible constituency office in Hinckley and Bosworth and hold regular constituents' surgeries at accessible venues around the constituency.\n9. If I have to maintain a second home for overnight accommodation in London then it will be furnished at my own expense. If bought with public funds, I will proportionately repay 100% of any unearned increase in value at the end of my term of office.\n10. If I broke the rules, as Bosworth's current MP did over cash for questions, I will voluntarily submit myself for recall to the constituents of Hinckley and Bosworth upon receipt and verification of a petition of 20% of the local electorate.

On top of this, funding would be spent on helping people insulate their homes to slash heating bills in the long term.\nHinckley Liberal Democrat Councillor Michael Mullaney who has written to the Secretary of State for Energy said:\n\"It can't be right that a few energy firms are making millions from record gas prices while people can't even afford to heat their homes as the cost of living crisis hits Hinckley and Bosworth hard.\n\"A one-off Robin Hood tax on gas and oil bosses would provide vital funding to support families in our area who are facing crippling energy price hikes.\n\"For years the Conservatives have ignored this problem and failed to take the bold action we need to reduce fuel poverty. The Government cannot look the other way any longer while families struggle to get by.\"\nText of the letter from Michael to the Secretary of State for Energy\nRt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP\nSecretary of State\nDepartment for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy\n1 Victoria Street\nLondon\nSW1H 0ET\nUnited Kingdom\nDear Secretary of State,\nI write to you with urgency as the cost of living crisis bares the brunt on residents of Hinckley and Bosworth.\nLiberal Democrat Leader and former Energy Secretary Ed Davey has called for a \"Robin Hood\" tax on the super-profits of oil and gas firms and I am urging you to back the initiative.\nIt recently emerged that Russian energy giant Gazprom's trading arm, based in London, has cashed in a £179 million dividend. Meanwhile, the boss of BP has described his company as a 'cash machine' after soaring oil and gas prices boosted its profits to £2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021 alone.\nA windfall tax would be a one-off levy on firms who have made huge profits from record high gas prices. This would include oil and gas producers along with energy traders such as Gazprom's trading arm that profit from betting on fluctuations in energy prices.\nThe proposed one-off levy would raise an estimated £5 billion from companies that are making record profits from soaring energy prices, this could fund:\n- Doubling and extending the Warm Homes Discount (£2bn): Taking £300 a year off the heating bills of around 7.5 million vulnerable and low income households, by more than doubling the Warm Homes Discount and extending it to all those on Universal Credit and Pension Credit. This would also reduce energy bills for all households across the country, as currently the Warm Homes Discount is paid for by other customers rather than through taxing the super-profits of oil and gas companies.\n- Doubling the Winter Fuel Allowance (£1.9bn): Giving up to £600 a year to 11.3 million elderly pensioners to help with their heating bills, through a one-off doubling of the Winter Fuel Allowance. Pensioners are currently facing a £208 real-terms cut to the state pension next year due to the Conservative government's decision to scrap the triple lock. This would cost an estimated £1.9 billion.\n- A new ten-year home insulation scheme (£500m): This would be spent on reducing people's energy bills in the long-term through an emergency home insulation programme to upgrade poorly insulated UK homes - including through fully funded grants for those in fuel poverty and on low incomes. This would cost an estimated £500 million in the next year.\n- Supporting energy intensive businesses (£500m): This funding would be used to support businesses and protect jobs in energy-intensive industries, while helping firms reduce their need for energy in the long-term.\nThis would provide enormous amounts of support to the thousands of residents in Hinckley and Bosworth who are facing a crippling 50% increase to their energy bills.\nSince 2015 the Conservatives have failed to take action on making our homes warmer. We have seen energy efficiency standards for new homes scrapped and a complete failure to insulate millions of homes and cut people's energy bills.\nNow, we need a substantial package of support that provides immediate support to those struggling to get by, while helping people insulate their homes to slash heating bills in the long term.\nI look forward to your urgent response.\nYours,\nCouncillor Michael Mullaney\nMember of Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council and Executive member for Housing and Community Safety\nLeader of the Opposition on Leicestershire County Council",

Improve the experience of people who rely on the railways for work by investing in commuter routes.\n• Convert the rail network to ultra-low-emission technology (electric or hydrogen) by 2035.\n• Invest £15 billion over the next Parliament to reopen rail lines and accelerate decarbonisation of the railways.\n• Fix the broken fares and ticketing system so that it provides better value for money. Changing the annual fare increase calculation from RPI to CPI following the fare freeze.\n• Start a revolution in rail franchising by opening up the bidding process to public sector companies, local or combined authorities, not-for-profits and mutuals.\n• Build into new rail franchise agreements a stronger focus on customers, including investment in new stations, lines and modern trains.

  "http_bosworthlibdems_org_uk_/http_bosworthlibdems_org_uk_news_article_burbage-traffic-and-parking-by-paul-williams-burbage-campaigner/content_645.html": "Burbage – Traffic and Parking by Paul Williams Burbage Campaigner\nBurbage - Traffic and Parking\nIn talking to residents, in the village, over the last few weeks, one of the major concerns for people is traffic and parking.\nIt's a fact that many of the village streets were designed and laid out in a time of the horse and cart. More worryingly some of the new streets, introduced in living memory, are also struggling to cope with 21st century traffic. I grew up in Burbage in the 1960s when there was a regular double deck bus running through the centre of the village on a twenty-minute timetable, car ownership was for the few. The growth of car ownership and employment spread over a wider area, meant such public services became less popular and hence less viable.\nAs the car population grew, so did the houses, until we reach what is generally viewed as saturation in the village. Unfortunately, even if the growth of new housing in the village can be arrested, the growth in the wider areas of Leicestershire and the welcome introduction of new job opportunities means traffic will continue to rise. Hinckley and Burbage share a close connection, but the barrier between them of the railway line provides the recipe for traffic bottleneck. The growth potential which the M69 (and increasingly the A5) provides to Hinckley, Barwell and Earl Shilton, is exploited via the roads leading through Burbage; Rugby Road, Sapcote Road and Lutterworth Road.\nCongestion on these routes through the village leads to many vehicles taking alternative routes through the streets of Burbage, adding to the burden here. Compared to the congestion of major urban areas, we are still relatively little troubled by comparison. However, when we do experience congestion, we are less tolerant of it, and sadly sometimes people are tempted to \"make-up\" time in inappropriate places, rushing down clear sections of road to the next parked car.\nSpeed and Safety\nOf all the problems we have with traffic in the village, safety must be the number one priority. One child knocked down, an old person hit or a cyclist collision, has no comparison to frustration and delay in our journey. When we are trying to travel through the village it is so easy to become frustrated with the delay, for example delays along Coventry Road between the entrance to Victoria Road and Salem Road. We must recognise that if those parked cars in this section were not there it is extremely likely more traffic would divert along Coventry Road, at even higher speeds.\nAs a 5-year old child growing up along Coventry Road in the early 1960s, I ran across the road to see a friend on the other side, directly in the path of a car. The car screeched to a halt and all was well. Thankfully for me, and my relieved parents, the car was driven by a gentleman who always travelled down the road at 20 mph, thus he had time to stop. We now have a 20mph zone within the village. In a modern motor car 20mph can seem a painfully slow experience, but in my opinion, we must embrace the concept and acceptance that driving through the village must be at a lower average speed than we would wish. Each evening between 4 and 6 o'clock on Rugby Road, those vehicles travelling into Hinckley would be extremely pleased if their average speed was 10mph. I would estimate that the average speed along here many evenings is 2-3mph.\nSo how could lower speeds be achieved?\n- One extremely rapid option is for the village population to think very carefully about a sensible and safe speed for our journey, 30mph is a maximum, not necessarily the appropriate speed for the conditions.\n- Consider putting more specifically designed physical breaks into the carriage-way, small give way sections which forces traffic to halt and give way to traffic from the other direction.\n- Introduce more speed humps, not universally popular, although the longer ramp-flat-ramp are more acceptable than the old \"bumps\"\n- Install more speed detection/ warning signs, there are three currently installed in Lutterworth Road, although these signs can be moved around the village.\n- Extend the 20mph zone, many whole boroughs in London now have 20mph blanket limits\n- Install number plate recognition monitors on the routes through the village, to enforce an average speed on these routes.\nMost of these options involve cost and will impact residents and therefore it is important that community engagement is carried out to assess each option and obtain general support if taken forward.\nParking\nAs I have mentioned above, parking can be a curse and a blessing. Cars parked on the carriageway is a help in terms of slowing down the average speed and hence deterring through traffic, but it can be a real nuisance for some. Obstruction is perhaps the biggest problem, and this can take two forms;\n- Obstruction for other traffic, particularly buses, can lead to extreme delays and disruption for passengers.\n- Obstruction of the pavement\nIn certain circumstances, in the narrow streets of Burbage, parking partly upon the pavement can be considerate and helpful to allow the passage of traffic. This consideration MUST also extend to the pavement users. Parking must NEVER obstruct the pavement. As a rule of thumb, if a double width pushchair could not pass the vehicle then obstruction has occurred, and enforcement action could be taken. Please be considerate of both passing traffic and pavement users when parking. Sadly, in the last few weeks I have noticed many examples of cars or vans being parked causing an obstruction to pavement users.\nTackling the Issue\nAs we move towards the third decade of the 21st century, we may see yet another revo lution of local transport on the horizon. The development of electric and self-driving vehicles may lead to major change once more to the transport situation in the village, hopefully introducing beneficial change. Unfortunately, we live in the moment, and our current traffic and parking issues cause concern, frustration and detriment to the community. We must therefore work together in considering improvements and revised behaviour. Solutions proposed by some, will be disliked by others, and this is an immediate area where community members affect the lives of others. We need to work for as much consensus as possible, but this should not be at the expense of inaction.\nThe first step is the acknowledgement of the problems, followed by investigations of the potential changes which can be introduced. I commit myself to working, along with others, to make real progress.\nPaul Williams - Burbage Parish Campaigner",

Energy companies should be forced to use some of the money from the £9bn European windfall to help protect some of the most vulnerable people from the effects of fuel poverty.\"\nThe Proposals in Tackling Fuel Poverty include:\n· Making energy companies invest £500m a year into a rolling programme to make sure homes are properly insulated\n· Requiring energy companies to roll out social tariffs to over two million vulnerable customers this would reduce fuel bills for some of the poorest customers.\n· Installing smart meters in homes, which display real time consumption costs",

Michael said \"There are 175 voluntary organisations in Bosworth that all rely on the dedication, energy and commitment of 900 trustees in order to support their beneficiaries.\n\"To give one example locally, I have been honoured to be able to be a member of the Board of Hinckley Museum and to witness the fantastic work that the Trustees do to keep this great service in the area going.\n\"Trustees are the people ultimately in charge of a charity. They make decisions that help charities achieve their aims and change their beneficiaries' lives.\n\"It is also a time to encourage more people to become trustees, as many voluntary organisations find it difficult to recruit new trustees. As many as one in five charities are looking for a new trustee.\n\"Being a trustee allows you not only to make a difference to the lives of others, but to learn new skills, meet different people, and develop your career. Voluntary organisations are always looking for a range of skills and different backgrounds on their boards, as well as more young people. You can find out more about trustee vacancies in your local area through NCVO's Trustee Bank, Charity Job and Do It.\"\nSir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said:\n\"Trustees' Week is a great opportunity for us to recognise and celebrate trustees and the valuable contribution they make to our society. They play a vital role, volunteering their time and working together to make important decisions about the charity's work. Good governance is at the very heart of an effective charity.\"",

Meanwhile, broadband bills are set to rise by 9.3% with inflation at its highest rate in almost thirty years.\nThe Liberal Democrats warned that Rishi Sunak's proposals to deal with soaring energy bills will just be \"spreading the pain over the coming years\" while clobbering local families with tax hikes.\nThe cost of living rescue package being proposed by Hinckley and Bosworth Liberal Democrats includes taking £300 off struggling families' heating bills by doubling and expanding the Warm Home Discount, funded through a \"Robin Hood\" tax on the super profits of oil and gas companies. The party would also scrap the planned National Insurance tax hike being introduced by the Conservatives in April, and ensure low-income families can access cheaper broadband deals.\nAs many as 5,949 households in Hinckley and Bosworth ould stand to benefit from the full package of support, saving them up to £975 each a year. Whilst 26,751 households would save up to £600 thanks to the scrapping of the National Insurance hike and the Stealth Tax on the income tax personal allowance. 1,868 poorer pensioners would receive the expanded Warm Home Discount while 9,096 struggling families would gain access to cheaper broadband deals, helping them cope with the cost of living crisis.\nIn total, the package represents savings of 20,861,283 across Hinckley and Bosworth for 37,715 households feeling the pinch.\nHinckley Liberal Democrat councillor and leader of the opposition on Leicestershire County Council Michael Mullaney said:\n\"Energy bills are going through the roof, forcing families in our community to choose between eating and heating. But all the Conservatives are doing is clobbering people with an unfair tax hike and spreading the pain over the coming years.\n\"Hinckley and Bosworth deserves better than a Conservative Prime Minister missing in action, more concerned with their own political career than helping families struggling to pay the bills.\n\"The Liberal Democrats' cost of living rescue plan would wipe up to £1,000 off the bills of 37,175 struggling families in Hinckley and Bosworth by scrapping April's tax hike, offering support to the most vulnerable, and insulating homes to slash energy bills in the long term.\n\"We are fighting for a fair deal for people in our community who are being let down by a Conservative Government that is taking them for granted.\"",

The review found that, in pilots where all children had been given a free school dinner, students were academically months ahead of their peers elsewhere and more likely to eat vegetables at lunchtime.\n\"At the same time, the Coalition will extend free school meals to disadvantaged students in further education and sixth form colleges. Free school meals are currently available only for eligible students at school sixth forms.\n\"Eventually I hope every primary school pupil should be able to sit down to a hot, healthy lunch with their classmates every day.\n\"We will start with infant school pupils because teaching healthy habits young, and boosting attainment early, will bring the biggest benefits.\n\"Millions of parents across the country are feeling the squeeze. During the course of a year, the average family spends £400 on lunch for each child. We are determined to ease the financial burden for these families and give every child the chance in life that they deserve, building a stronger economy and a fairer society.\"",

Ever since 2010 this can never happen again thanks to the Liberal Democrats.\nThanks to the Liberal Democrats' triple lock guarantee, the basic state pension has risen in each year of the last parliament by whichever is the higher of earnings, prices or 2.5%. The triple lock was a key demand from the Liberal Democrats in Coalition negotiations.\nThis means the state pension is £440 higher per year in 2014-15 than if it had increased in line with earnings from the start of this Parliament, and £800 a year more in total.\nOnly the Liberal Democrats are committed to write this guarantee into law, giving pensioners more certainty that their pension will continue to rise in future.\nIt is expected to benefit 115,437 pensioners in Leicestershire\nSupporting the plan, Cllr Michael Mullaney said:\n\"A decent income in retirement for pensioners is central to the Liberal Democrat vision of a fair society.\n\"For decades, successive Labour and Conservative governments allowed the state pension to decline after Mrs. Thatcher broke the 'earnings link' in 1980. Our manifesto promise of a 'triple lock' has been implemented every year since 2010 and means that the state pension is already a higher share of the national average wage than at any time since the early 1990s.\n\"But if we are serious about having a decent state pension we need to go further. That is why the Liberal Democrats will guarantee in law that in each year pensions will rise by the highest of wages, prices or 2.5%.\"\nThe Liberal Democrat plans are in stark contrast to the Labour years, which on one occasion saw Gordon Brown increase the state pension by just 75p-a-week.\nThe triple lock guarantee would ensure an increase in the value of the state pension of at least £790 per year by the end of the next Parliament.\nPensioners who receive the full state pension would get at least £6,800 in 2020.\nThis is the minimum increase that would be delivered. Based on current assumptions, the actual level of the state pension is likely to be even higher, at £139.95 per week (or £7,277 per year).",

This is a total loss of income of 3,821,532 between 22,270 pensioners in Hinckley and Bosworth due to the Conservative government's decision to break a key manifesto promise and scrap the triple lock on pensions.\nAnalysis by the Liberal Democrats has shown this broken promise will wipe out the \"paltry support\" being offered by the government to help pensioners cope with soaring energy bills. Even those pensioners who qualify for a council tax rebate will be left over £20 poorer in real terms, while those on the New State Pension will be left short-changed by £76.20. It means retirees in Hinckley and Bosworth are facing down a £481,032 gulf between their lost pension income and support, with that only gulf only set to widen further with the Bank of England forecasting inflation in April of 7.25%.\nHinckley and Bosworth Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to row back on their broken promise and guarantee a fairer increase to the state pension. The party is also calling for a doubling and expansion to the Warm Home Discount, giving 9,248 households in Hinckley and Bosworth £300 each off their heating bills this year & a doubling of the Winter Fuel Allowance, to the benefit of 25,730 households.\nHinckley Liberal Democrat Councillor Michael Mullaney, said:\n\"These figures expose a black hole in the Government's cost of living package for pensioners.\n\"In breaking their manifesto promise and failing to protect the state pension, the Conservatives have plunged older people in Hinckley and Bosworth into the depths of a cost of living crisis. Their paltry support doesn't even begin to cover the additional costs people are facing during this cold and bitter winter.\n\"Pensioners are among the most vulnerable people in Hinckley and Bosworth this out of touch Government has left them out in the cold, with a hole in their pocket and even harsher days ahead.\n\"It's high time the Government showed some common sense and ensured a fair increase to the state pension. But we also need to see something much more ambitious to help pensioners in Hinckley and Bosworth. Doubling the Warm Home Discount and Winter Fuel Allowance, funded through a Robin Hood tax on the super-profits of oil and gas giants, would be a good place to start.\"",

That makes it even tougher for small businesses in Hinckley and Bosworth putting our high streets at further risk. Ministers must level the playing field.\"\nLiberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine MP added:\n\"In the Summer, the Chancellor launched a campaign to support the hospitality sector. We now need to see this Government go the extra mile to support small business in the festive period.\n\"We want the Chancellor to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting for Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home.\"\nMike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:\n\"This is the type of creative idea that would boost small businesses and balance out the playing field.\n\"We must do everything we can to help our small, independent stores.\n\"This is going to be the most important festive season our economy has ever seen and could be make-or-break for some of our small businesses.\n\"That's why we must pull out all the stops to help them survive the end of 2020 and beyond\nThe text of the letter sent from Christine Jardine is as follows:\nDear Rishi,\nI would like to ask you to consider a support scheme for small businesses through the festive season which would help them in a similar way to the 'eat out to help out' campaign which the Government funded in the summer.\nSmall businesses in England are missing out on business in precious lucrative months and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland footfall is still significantly reduced even though a full lockdown hasn't been imposed.\nI urge you to explore pathways to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home.\nThe free postage offers from online shopping giants and the ease of using Amazon Prime are incredibly tempting for those Christmas shopping online.\nPaying postage on each individual Christmas purchase is a burden that is likely to repel shoppers from picking small retailers. That makes it an even tougher climate for small business and shut shops.\nThe prohibitive nature of these costs rings especially true for those in remote or rural communities for whom delivery charges are unjustly steep.\nI am urging to embrace this idea as a way to stimulate traffic to small business sites. Removing the delivery cost burden would encourage shoppers to select individual items from different small shops - rather than resorting to bulk buy from large suppliers.\nI look forward to your response.\nYours sincerely,\nChristine Jardine",

At the meeting Michael Mullaney said \"When Emas held a meeting in Leicester recently it was reported in the press that only two people turned up, well there are far more than two people at this meeting today and this just reflects how much concern there is in the Hinckley area about EMAS plans.\n\"EMAS assert that the changes will improve response times. Isn't it the case though, as the Unions have said, that the consequence of these changes will be to improve response times in the immediate area around the hub at the expense of response times at places further away from the hubs, like here in Hinckley and Bosworth.\n\"Under EMAS plans Hinckley and Bosworth's ambulances will begin and end their shifts from Leicester's hub. What is to stop the ambulance for this area being diverted at the beginning of its shift to calls in Leicester? This will probably have the effect of improving response times for EMAS around the hub but at the expense of longer waiting times in our area.\n\"When health professionals say making these changes will improve response times then of course we have to listen, and if the health profession were united on these changes then it wouldn't be my place to question them. However, there is no unity in the health world in favour of these plans.\n\"Many of the staff at EMAS oppose these plans, some may not want to say it openly, but the leadership of EMAS must know how much opposition there is to this from many staff and surely that should make you rethink. Unions representing ambulance staff have opposed the changes and the online Number 10 petition running across the East Midlands against the plans were set up by unions representing staff.\n\"The Hinckley urban area covering Burbage, Barwell and Earl Shilton is one of the biggest population concentrations in the county, even before you begin to add nearby villages to Hinckley such as Stoke Golding, Higham on the Hill and Stapleton. It is clear a population of this size needs an ambulance based here full time.\n\"We believe that the ambulance station should be based in Hinckley, if because of EMAS plans that is not possible, the very least we would ask is that, because of this big population and because of the distance from Hinckley to Leicester, that if there is to be a hub system then one of those Hubs should be based in Hinckley.

This CPA rating has shown that we have made great strides towards doing that.\"\nIn their report, the Audit Commission inspectors praise councillors for tackling the key issues and challenges that face the Borough, such as economic regeneration, strengthening local communities and planning the council's budget.\n\"As a result, good progress is now being made on town centre redevelopment in Hinckley, an issue that residents have wanted the council to address for nearly 20 years,\" they say.\nThe inspectors also praise the \"constructive and collective leadership by councillors along with strong managerial leadership\", which they say, has contributed to the council having a \"robust and healthy organisational culture.\"\n\"Good communications, investment in training and development and excellent relationships with the trade union have created a culture where staff feel able to put forward their ideas to improve services. Staff are proud to work for the council, and as a result they focus strongly on the needs of their customers.\"\nIn addition, the improved leadership by councillors and officers is evident in the way the council works with other organisations to improve the quality of life for residents of the Borough. As a result, crime levels are down, deprivation is being tackled in priority neighbourhoods, a new town centre campus is being built for North Warwickshire and Hinckley College and co-operation with the voluntary and community sector is helping to support disadvantaged communities.\nThe inspectors also point out that financial and performance management is robust, which has enabled the council to maintain its focus on priorities, leading to a significant improvement in services for the public.\n\"Seventy four per cent of the council's Best Value performance indicators improved last year and half are in the best performing category compared to other councils, well above the district council average,\" say the inspectors.\nAlthough the inspectors point out that a number of challenges remain, they accept that the council is aware of them and is actively addressing them.",

Cutting taxes, reducing fuel bills, and slashing Interest Rates would help many local people who are struggling to make ends meet.\"\nThe Lib Dem proposals include;\n1. Cutting taxes for struggling families so they keep more money in their pockets.\nThe Liberal Democrats will cut taxes for people on low and middle incomes, raising them for the richest so the tax cuts are affordable. They will fund this by ending upper rate tax relief on pensions, clamping down on tax avoidance, harmonising income and capital gains taxes, increasing green taxation and trimming overall central public spending. These proposals would not increase the government fiscal deficit; that means they are affordable now. This tax cut is now urgent to get money to people who are struggling the most, helping them to pay for essentials and keep spending money in the high street.\n2. Lowering energy bills so people can afford to keep warm this winter\nAs wholesale fuel prices fall - they have dropped 28% since August - utility companies must lower people's bills too. Millions of people face a winter unable to heat their homes: 4 out of 5 single pensioners will be in fuel poverty this winter. Energy companies must pass on wholesale price cuts. Liberal Democrats will also change billing rules so the first units of energy you use are no longer the most expensive. Essential energy should be the cheapest, while bigger users pay more. This is fairer, and will help the environment. Finally, those energy companies that received a £9bn subsidy from the European Emissions Trading Scheme must invest in lower tariffs for vulnerable customers and providing comprehensive insulation for everyone.\n3. Keeping people in their homes, so they don't need to fear unfair repossessions\nBanks must only ever repossess people's homes as a last resort. Liberal Democrats will instruct the courts to make sure banks don't repossess unless they've already offered free independent financial advice, and pursued all alternatives like renegotiating the terms of the mortgage and offering a shared equity agreement.\nThere are already nearly two million families on housing waiting lists. We can help those families and prevent a homelessness crisis by allowing councils and housing associations to buy up unsold properties and land from building companies. This will replenish our social housing stock, stimulate the house building industry and provide homes now for people who need them.\n4. Lower mortgage payments and cheaper business loans through big interest rate cuts\nPeople and businesses need help paying off their mortgages and loans, so we need substantially lower interest rates. The UK still has higher official interest rates than the EU (4.5% compared to 3.75%) and dramatically higher rates than the US (1.5%). This makes it much harder for people to pay their mortgages, makes it harder for business to survive and slows the economy down. The Bank of England must remain independent, but at this time of emergency its remit must be changed to make interest rates fall dramatically and swiftly. This should be part of international action to cut rates across all major economies.",

For the previous year, a staggering 44.21 per cent of local children, almost half, had not been seen by an NHS dentist.\nThis is despite the NHS recommending that under-18s see a dentist at least once a year because their teeth can decay faster, compared to two years for adults. Tooth decay is also the leading cause of hospital admissions for children aged 6-10.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for an emergency rescue plan for NHS dentistry, including spending any funding that has gone unspent in recent years to boost the number of appointments as well as the removal of VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste.\nLiberal Democrat leader of the opposition on Leicestershire County Council Michael Mullaney, said:\n“I have heard countless stories of desperate parents who cannot find an NHS dentist anywhere in Leicestershire. Everyone knows how important it is for children to be able to see a dentist when they need to be in our area, far too often that is proving impossible.\n“The Conservative party’s disastrous legacy on the NHS cannot be understated. The new government must make fixing local health services like dentistry here in Leicestershire a top priority after the Conservatives ran them into the ground.\"\n“The only way we will rescue dentistry in our area is by the government investing in local health services at the Budget and bringing an end to dental deserts so that every child in Leicestershire can see a dentist when they need to.”",

As the County Council now have an agreement for volunteers to run Desford Library it makes no sense that they are now trying to offload a £45,000 repair bill on to those volunteers. As a precedent has already clearly been set at another library for volunteers to take on an internal lease with the council maintaining the fabric of the building, I would urge the County Council to do the same at Desford.\n\"Desford Library is a focal point of village life, and is far more than just a book lender: it provides an internet and email lifeline for those with no home access, photocopying and fax facilities, and keeps local history alive with its information services. I'd like to know how Councillor Blunt intends to maintain these essential services with a mobile library. Do these councillors really want to be the ones to say: 'We allowed libraries to close on our watch'?\n\"When this current administration has gone, its legacy will unfortunately live on, and libraries will be gone, too, unless councillors do the right thing - meet this relatively minor repair bill and pass control of the library to the volunteers who are eager to run it.\"",

It will also not be deployed in full until January next year.\n*In addition to getting people out of hospital so that they get care in a more comfortable setting, the number of beds in hospitals needs to be increased to end excessive handover delays for ambulances, caused by a lack of bed capacity. Any new beds must come with increases in staff to care for those extra patients.\n*Expand mental health support services to get people the appropriate care they need and reduce the number of call outs for ambulances for mental health reasons. Learning from hospitals that have set up 'emergency mental health departments', will not only to get people more appropriate care but relieve pressure on A&Es and ambulances.\n*Pass Daisy Cooper MP's Ambulance Waiting Times Bill into law that would require accessible, localised reports of ambulance response times to be published. This would ensure that 'hot spots' with some of the longest waiting times can be identified routinely. 12 hour waits at A&E should also be published from arrival at hospital rather than the 'decision to admit' as is current practice, so that the true scale of the problem is clear for all to see.",

Whilst it's clear that some things are causing it beyond the Council's control, Ukraine conflict and Covid, the reality is some things that are controllable have contributed to the current situation.\n\"The weakening of the national finances after the calamitous Conservative mini budget under Liz Truss has certainly contributed and even more is the fact that we in Leicestershire continue to be the worst funded county in the country by this Tory government. How many years have we waited for fair funding from the Tory government, many and now we hear the Leicestershire Tory MPs are meeting Jeremy Hunt the Chancellor. I wish them well but if this is like every one of the previous meetings it will lead to no change and Leicestershire still losing out.\n\"The County Councils poor financial situation will mean Council Tax rises for residents and cuts to local service cuts at times which are already hard for many people. What will these cuts mean? It will mean very likely cuts to highways budgets which will mean the further deterioration of roads and pavements. How often do we report badly damaged roads and pavements to the County Council to be told they can't be resurfaced or repaired or if they are repaired it's a basic patch work that soon breaks up again? How many of our residents are frustrated about this many of them. What will happen in future it will get even worse.\n\"Special Education Needs services are already overstretched how much worse may they get if hit by cuts?\n\"Public transport, the county council subsidises a number of bus services, particularly in rural areas of the County these may be lost.\n\"Who do we hold responsible for the fact that Leicestershire is the worst funded county in the country?\n\"Do we blame the government for their unfair funding formula which hits Leicestershire?\n\"Do we blame Leicestershire's 7 MPs for failing to strongly enough stand up for the area in the same way in which Red Wall Tory MPs in the North of England have got plenty of resources for their areas?\n\"Or do we blame the leadership of this county council for failing to convince the government?\n\"People will differ in the proportion of the blame and culpability which they give to each of those groups. Who of these three differing groups are to blame for Leicestershire being at the bottom of the league for service funding?\n\"They are three different groups but they all have one similar characteristic.\n\"Conservative, Conservative, Conservative\n\"We have a Conservative only government since 2015, all 7 Leicestershire MPs have been Conservative since 2010 and we've had a Conservative run county council since 2001.\n\"Whoever is to blame for Leicestershire losing out somewhere down the line it's the Conservatives for taking us for granted.\n\"Will this ever change. Will the people of Leicestershire get the fair funding they deserve and the quality services they deserve?\"It seems the only way of getting a better deal from the Conservatives is to change how you vote. The red wall areas started voting Conservative so got extra support from the Conservative government.\n\"Clearly the only way for Leicestershire to get more funding from a Conservative government that takes them for granted is for Leicestershire to stop voting Conservative the shock of which will wake the tory government out of its complacency and make it realise it needs to fund Leicestershire fairly.\"",

Raising the carers allowance would be one way in which their vital work can be appreciated and their often perilous financial situation supported.\"\nSeconding the motion Lib Dem Councillor Mark Sheppard Bools said \"Carers are the hidden heroes that take so much of the burden off our overstretched NHS. Without their selfless dedication many more people would need to be cared for in a hospital or care home setting.\n\"By raising the allowance for carers, it ensures that those looking after people can do so without the worry of falling into financial hardship and gives dignity to those being looked after, by enabling them to stay in their homes and be cared for by those who know them best.\"\nThe Carers UK survey found that '43% of carers felt that a rise in Carer's Allowance would help them, given the financial pressures they are facing.\nThe wording of the motion being brought to the meeting is\nCouncil motion: Stand Up For Carers\nProposed by Councillor Michael Mullaney\nSeconded by Councillor Mark Sheppard-Bools\nCouncil notes that:\nCarers - paid and unpaid, young and old - do a remarkable and important job. They are an integral part of our community in Hinckley and Bosworth. They deserve our support, but are far too often forgotten and ignored.\nCarers in Hinckley and Bosworth and across the country face big challenges every single day; challenges that have been made even harder by the Covid-19 pandemic. Most carers are having to spend more time looking after loved ones during the pandemic; most haven't been able to take a single break since it started; and most are simply exhausted.\nSituations provoking care interventions can happen with little warning. Often those giving care have to reduce their working hours or give up work to juggle\ncompeting demands.\nThe pressures on young carers can negatively impact on their experiences and outcomes in education, having a lasting effect on their\nlife chances.\nMany carers are unaware of their entitlement to financial support, a carers assessment or break, and the support services available.\nCouncil further notes that:\n1,167 full-time unpaid carers in Hinckley and Bosworth rely on Carer's\nAllowance.\nAt ust £67.25 a week, Carer's Allowance is the lowest benefit of its kind. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government increased the\nUniversal Credit standard allowance and the Working Tax Credit basic element by £20 a week above the planned uprating in April 2020, but it has\nnot increased Carer's Allowance.\nMany unpaid carers are facing extreme financial hardship. A recent survey by Carers UK found that more than a third of those on Carer's Allowance are\nstruggling to make ends meet. Many have been struggling for months, often relying on foodbanks to feed themselves and the people they care for.\nThe Carers UK survey found that \"43% of carers felt that a rise in Carer's Allowance would help them, given the financial pressures they are facing.\"\nCouncil resolves that: We must stand up for carers, do more to support them, and build a more\ncaring society as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWe will review how carers in Hinckley and Bosworth are made aware of existing support that is available and to bring back any recommendations to Hinckley and Bosworth\nPromote Young Carers Action Day on March 16th 2021 as widely as possible on an annual basis, particularly to young carers and their families.\nCouncil calls on the Chief Executive to:\nWrite to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, urging them to raise Carer's Allowance by £20 a week\nimmediately, in line with the increase in Universal Credit, and copy in our local MPs, asking for their support.",

But to be considering this disruption when we are still in the middle of a pandemic, which sadly looks like it will last for at least many more months, is totally irresponsible of the government. During the Covid-19 outbreak we have seen local Borough and District Councils step up to the plate with their local knowledge of the communities they serve to provide local support, like delivering food parcels to vulnerable people who were shielding, supporting businesses and co-ordinating local volunteers.\n\"It's a huge mistake for the Conservative government to now suggest scrapping these local councils to create large Unitary authorities. The proposals such as the suggested single Unitary Council for all of Leicestershire would create authorities that were more remote from the people they are meant to serve, and with less local knowledge and less responsive to local needs.\n\"This letter signed by over a 100 Liberal Democrat Borough, County, District and City councillors across the East Midlands Region shows there is strong opposition to the government's proposed new Unitary authorities. In addition To Lib Dem opposition there are many Conservative, Labour, Green and Independent councillors who are also opposed to the plans.\"\nCllr Paul Holmes added, \" The idea of imposing huge Unitary Councils, covering wide geographical areas, is bad for local community representation and accountability. Coupling this with the imposition of directly elected Mayors covering entire Regions is not remotely Devolution but is fact centralisation of power into fewer and more remote and unaccountable hands. Across the country the electorate have almost always rejected such proposals when asked to vote on them.\"\n\"We hope the Secretary of State will listen to our objections and understand that there is huge opposition to their disruptive, time consuming Unitary plans that will make local government in the East Midlands less local and more remote from the people it's there to serve\"\nText of the letter and the signatures below\nDear Secretary of State,\nEven before the publication of the mis-named 'Devolution' white paper, Conservative run county councils such as Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire have been setting out their proposals to variously:\n- Abolish the county elections of May 2021\n- Abolish all district and borough councils\n- Elect new, massive and remote county wide unitary authorities of up\nto a million people in May 2023.\nWe believe that these proposals are fundamentally wrong in every respect.\nThey would mean that all the councils involved would spend the next two and a half years arguing over and concentrating on, the expensive business of large-scale closure, merger, defining and reapplying for jobs, redundancy and closing down sites. This is the last thing we need when tackling Covid-19, and its economic fallout should be the number one priority.\nThe UK already has the lowest ratio of councils and councillors per head of population of any Western European country. Abolishing all district and borough councils would make this democratic deficit even worse. Far from representing 'devolution' these plans represent a huge centralising of roles and local responsibilities.\nDistrict and borough councils are rooted in and represent the interests of their local communities in a way which large (in population and geographic area) unitary authorities cannot remotely do. Most recently this has been clearly shown during the Covid-19 outbreak when the flexible, local knowledge and expertise of district and borough councils has provided the cutting edge of distributing local business support grants, delivering food parcels to the local shielded population, advising their local retail businesses on social distancing strategies and much else.\nUnitary authorities in compact, geographically small areas with a clear community identity make good sense, as seen in our cities and in a very small county such as Rutland. Huge unitary authorities of up to a million people spread across a wide geographic area do not. Smaller unitary authorities that reflect actual communities work well across Europe and the USA but the UK government has so far ruled this out.\nThe financial problems of local government have been caused because the government has cut 40 per cent of its funding. The massive problems of adult social care are a result of successive governments failing to deal with the problem. The increasing expense and complexity of parts of local government are due to the government's imposition of new and costly tiers, with police and crime commissioners and directly elected mayors.\nWe call upon the government to reverse the cuts to the funding of local government, withdraw their so called 'devolution plans' and consult on an effective form of community based local government. Devolution should mean moving power downwards not moving it up to large and remote bodies.\nYours faithfully,\nCouncillor Michael Mullaney.

Michael Mullaney said \"Almost every family in Leicestershire will have been affected by cancer. Each year around 4,000 people in the county develop cancer and sadly around 2,000 die from it.\n\"The public health grant has been reduced by nearly a quarter (24%) since 2015/16, despite a growing and urgent need for investment in public health and prevention. These reductions are having a significant impact on public health services and functions. Taking these funds away from prevention services that prevent ill health is a false economy.\n\"Smoking, obesity and alcohol have been estimated to account for 80,000, 30,000 and 7,000 early deaths each year respectively; and smoking remains the single biggest cause of preventable cancer.\n\"That's why, with the support of Cancer Research UK, this motion calls on the UK Government to provide increased and sustainable funding for public health - to prevent ill health, reduce health inequalities and support a sustainable health and social care system.\"\nThe full text of the motion proposed by Michael Mullaney and seconded by Cllr Louise Richardson was as follows\nPREVENTION SERVICES, PUBLIC HEALTH AND CANCER\n(a) This Council notes that:\n(i) Preventable disease and mortality continue to have a massive impact on the public's health, the NHS and the economy. This has only come into sharper focus since the emergence of COVID-19, with preventable causes of cancer such as obesity being associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Further disruption caused by COVID-19 has also had a detrimental effect on the diagnosis of cancer cases; Cancer Research UK estimates that 3 million fewer people were screened in the UK between March and September 2020.\n(ii) Investment in disease prevention and the public health grant must be a priority for the UK Government. The grant funds vital services and functions that prevent ill health, reduce health inequalities, and contribute to the future sustainability of the NHS. Local authorities are responsible for improving the health of their populations and do this through services such as stop smoking services, tobacco control and action on diet, exercise, and obesity. But their ability to do so is compromised by continued reductions to the Public Health grant.\n(iii) In 2020/21, the public health grant was given a small uplift of £45 million by the UK Government - equivalent to a cash increase of 0.67%. In reality, however, this represents a 24% reduction, equivalent to £1 billion on a real term basis since 2015/16.\n(iv) Taking funds away from prevention is a false economy. Without proper investment in public health, people suffer, demand on local health services increases, and the economy suffers. This uplift does not consider the impact of COVID-19 on local government budgets, nor their response to the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic. As well as working hard to safely deliver normal public health functions, councils have also had to respond to the pandemic by supporting national efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, protect vulnerable members of the community and support local businesses and communities. In consequence, local preventive action has suffered.\n(v) Unless funding to improve public health is increased, our health and care system will remain locked in a 'treatment' approach, which is neither economically viable nor protects the health of residents. Deprived areas suffer the worst health outcomes, so it is also vital that areas with the greatest need receive sufficient funding to meet their local challenges. An estimated 27,000 cases of cancer a year in England are associated with socioeconomic deprivation.\n(b) This Council further notes that in Leicestershire, there are around 4,000 cancer cases per year, and around 2,000 deaths from cancer per year. Around four in ten cancers are preventable, largely through avoidable risk factors, such as stopping smoking, keeping a healthy weight and cutting back on alcohol. In 2017, smoking was estimated to account for 80,000 early deaths every year in England and it remains the largest preventable cause of cancer in the world. Smoking-related ill health costs local authorities £883.5 million every year in social care costs. Additionally, obesity and alcohol account for 30,000 and 7,000 early deaths each year respectively.\n(c) This Council therefore supports Cancer Research UK's calls for increased and sustainable public health funding, which will also help to level up unfair health inequalities, bolster our health and social care system and the economy, and help us rebuild and recover from COVID-19. In turn, Leicestershire County Council will continue to support and fund locally-delivered prevention services and other public health initiatives to the best of our abilities - to prevent ill-health, reduce inequalities and support a health and social care system that is fit for the future.",

We will be looking for radical changes in the tax system which lock in lower rates of income tax for good.\n\"To make these tax cuts lasting, they have to be funded. That means shifting the tax burden onto pollution and ending the tax perks and loopholes enjoyed by the highest earners.\n\"We are worried that the Government will simply introduce temporary tax cuts, paid for by borrowing, which will disappear once we start to come out of recession.\n\"Now is the time for a genuine and radical change to the tax system. Liberal Democrats will be pressing for that and, having spoken to many local residents I know it is what people here want.\n\"We believe, however, that an area where borrowing should be allowed is investment in new buildings and facilities that are needed.

Leicestershire Lib Dem Finance spokesman Councillor Michael Mullaney said \"This is a bitter disappointment for Leicestershire. Many of our towns would have welcomed being part of this fund to help them recover post Covid-19.\n\"Sadly this is another example of Leicestershire missing out. We have the worst funded County Council by the government in the country, meaning people paying more and more in Council Tax. We have police, schools and fire services among the worst funded in the country by the government. Now none of our towns have been included in this support either.\n\"The people of Leicestershire have loyally elected a Conservative County Council for the last 20 years, they have elected all Tory MPs in Leicestershire. Yet it's clear the Conservatives sadly, just take local people for granted. Time and time again people's loyalty in voted Conservative has been thrown back at them by a Tory government that puts Leicestershire, its towns and services at the back of the queue.\"\nSimon Galton, Liberal Democrat Group Leader on the County Council said, \"The Government talks about its levelling up agenda. In reality this appears to be about improving the Conservative party's future election prospects as it is difficult to understand any other the rationale for the way this funding has been allocated.

Local Liberal Democrats have backed the proposals which would benefit 2,100 small businesses and entrepreneurs in Hinckley and Bosworth, from cafes and restaurants to high street shops.\nThe proposed tax cut would save small businesses an average of £5,000 a year by aiding them with staff costs. It would be achieved by quadrupling the Employment Allowance to £16,000 for a period of two years. This would allow a small business to employ five people on an average salary without paying any National Insurance contributions. 1.1 million businesses would be eligible for this tax cut, which would save them an estimated £5.5 billion next year.\nIt comes as a record number of small businesses say they are struggling with rising costs whilst new Covid restrictions loom, according to a recent survey by the Federation of Small Businesses. Local restaurants have also reported a surge in Christmas bookings being cancelled, setting owners back thousands of pounds.\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives have announced small businesses will have to pay more National Insurance contributions in the new year, despite facing a tough winter.

This means a staggering 92.5% of pensioners locally who used to receive Winter Fuel Payments will no longer get them.\nThe Winter Fuel Payments ranged from £100 to £300 and were paid to everyone over the state pension age.\nFrom this year onwards, to be eligible for the winter help, residents must have been born on or before 22nd September 1958 AND receive Pension Credit, Universal Credit, Income Support, income based Jobseeker’s Allowance or income-related Employment and Support Allowance, explained Michael Mullaney, Hinckley and Bosworth Liberal Democrat.\nHe added:” A big problem is that only about six in 10 people eligible for Pension Credits actually take them up.\n“I would urge anyone who thinks they are entitled to Pension Credits but not receiving them to apply – let’s get everyone who is entitled to this support claiming it and they should then be able to get the Winter Fuel Payment.\n“And with the next winter fuel price cap rises expected to be announced on 27 August and 25 November, it will be an especially worrying time for people who had perhaps been counting on the now axed winter fuel payment to help them out again this year”, said Michael Mullaney, who represents the Hinckley De Montfort ward on Hinckley and Bosworth council.\nIn the Hinckley and Bosworth Council area, 22,431 residents will not be getting the winter fuel payment this year following Labour’s surprise announcement.\n“We are worried that more older people in Hinckley and Bosworth will be faced with the horrid and stark choice of heating or eating once more this winter,” said Michael.\n“There will be many people likely to be just above the threshold for Pension Credit who will also undoubtedly struggle this winter. The Pension Credit is paid to those receiving a pension of less than £218.15 a week (or £332.95 a week for couples).\n“It’s difficult to believe that Labour would not have been aware of the real and biting impact such a drastic cut in the Winter Fuel Payments will have when they announced that more than nine in 10 pensioners locally would be frozen out. We must continue to lobby the Government to raise the threshold so that more pensioners can be helped to heat their homes this winter,”",

Electrification of the Midland Mainline will mean cleaner, faster trains for passengers and will be a boost for businesses in the region.\nIt's time Tory MPs and the Tory government did something for our region. It's time they reinstate electrification of the Midland Mainline.\"\nMathew Hulbert, Vice Chair of Bosworth Liberal Democrats and former Councillor for Barwell, says \"Under this Tory government the East Midlands always seems to be at the back of the queue when it comes to investment in new infrastructure. We also have among the lowest social mobility in the country, with more people born poor here likely to die poor than in many other parts of the country. I think these two factors are very likely to be connected, as investment in infrastructure projects, such as the electrification of the Midland Mainline, helps create jobs, helps local businesses, and helps the wider local economy and people at all levels in it.\n\"Failing Chris Grayling must now reverse his appalling decision and commit, as soon as possible, to the electrification of the Midland Mainline.\"",

Councillor Michael Mullaney, who is the Cancer Research UK Councillor Cancer Champion for Leicestershire was a signatory to the letter to Health Secretary Steve Barclay.\nIn the letter, coordinated by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and Cancer Research UK Michael Mullaney, alongside 47 other local councillors from across England, urge the Government to bring forward a new Tobacco Control Plan for England and to introduce a 'polluter pays' levy on tobacco manufacturers.\nIn Leicestershire alone, smoking is responsible for hundreds of premature deaths each year. Smoking also puts a significant strain on the NHS, with an estimated £3.6 billion spent on smoking-related health and social care in England every year. This is in addition to £13.2 billion each year in lost economic productivity resulting from premature death and disability caused by smoking. But this is not inevitable, and the Government has the power to change this.\nSigning the letter to the Secretary of State for Health Councillor Michael Mullaney said \"Almost everyone has been affected by deaths of loved ones from cancer. Sadly, despite a fall in the number of people smoking, far too many people are still dying too soon from the affects of smoking. I hope the Secretary of State for Health will listen to all of us who have written to him and help stem the deaths from smoking by taking real action. One of our key calls is for a \"polluter pays\" levy on the tobacco companies.\n\"The funds from this levy on the tobacco companies can be put into helping existing smokers quit and helping to prevent future generations of people from smoking. The tobacco industry has caused untold damage to many people's health, the least they can do is fund measures to try and limit the amount of people who still tragically die from their products.\"\nA copy of the letter and signatories can be read at Joint-Cllr-letter-to-Steve-Barclay-Final.pdf (ash.org.uk)",

In total, more than half a million people are currently on the Anthony Nolan register and the average per constituency is 927.\nNow, Michael Mullaney is encouraging more 16 to 30-year-olds to sign up. He says it is particularly important that young men and people from ethnic minorities join the register as they are currently under-represented.\nThe blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan created the world's first bone marrow donor register, and has been saving lives for four decades by matching remarkable people willing to donate their bone marrow or stem cells to patients in desperate need of a transplant. Two thirds of UK patients will not find a matching donor from within their families; instead they turn to Anthony Nolan to find them an unrelated donor.\nAnthony Nolan wants to give people the very best chance of life by finding the best possible match for them. But the charity can currently only find a perfect match for 60 per cent of transplant recipients, so they still urgently need more people to come forward.\nMichael Mullaney said: \"I am delighted that 1,177 people in Bosworth are registered on the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register.

What many people don't realise is that it is also surprisingly simple.'\nTo join the Anthony Nolan register you must be 16-30 and in good health. It involves filling out a simple online form and spitting into a tube. About 90% of people who are asked to donate will do so through a process similar to giving blood.\nThe charity needs heroes of all ages to champion the register at a local level and help us spread the word - from schools, communities and workplaces to your own friends and family.

However, since 2010, the retirement age has steadily increased so that by 2018 it will be 65, equal with men. By 2020, the retirement age for both men and women will have risen to 66.\nThe WASPI campaign states that they agree with equalising the pension age, but they feel that the transition has been too fast and that the government hasn't communicated these changes well enough, meaning that some women haven't realised that the pension age has changed until less than a year until they reach it.

The leader of the County Council states the level of council tax in the new authority would be set at the level of the lowest taxed local council. As Hinckley & Bosworth has the lowest council tax of any borough people in Hinckley and Bosworth would not get a tax cut under these plans, whilst everyone else in the county would. This is not a fair deal for taxpayers in Hinckley & Bosworth.\n\"I hope the Conservative leaders at County Hall will drop their plans to abolish Hinckley and Bosworth and the other boroughs.

The County Council leader made no mention of the plans to abolish Hinckley and Bosworth and other boroughs at that meeting. Yet on Friday he announced the plan.

This is down from 60.8% or more than six in ten children who had seen an NHS dentist in the year to 2018.\nThe stark figures were compiled by the House of Commons Library following a request by the Liberal Democrats.\nIt comes as distressing polling has found that one in five (21%) adults unable to see a dentist have carried out DIY dentistry in a desperate attempt to relieve their pain.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to set out an NHS winter rescue plan as soon as Parliament returns, to provide urgent help to those living in dental agony. This would also include immediate action to reduce dangerously long ambulance waiting times and speed up access to healthcare for the almost seven million people stuck on NHS waiting lists.\nLeader of Leicestershire Lib Dem County Councillors, Councillor Michael Mullaney said\n\"Far too many people in Leicestershire are struggling to see an NHS dentist and get the affordable dental healthcare they need. A recent BBC report found that no Dentists in Leicestershire asked were taking on new adult NHS patients.\n\"We have reached a dental crisis. NHS dentist appointments are becoming harder to get and practices are shutting their doors to NHS patients all together. Yet the government does nothing.\n\"With people feeling the pinch, private dentistry is not feasible for many people living in pain.\n\"It's a national scandal that people in our community are desperately turning to dangerous DIY dentistry because our public health services have been run into the ground by this Conservative government. Leicestershire has become a dental desert.\n\"Liberal Democrats are urging the Government to fund an NHS winter rescue package to improve access to NHS dental appointments, reduce ambulance waiting times and speed up treatment for those who need it.\"",

To deny free school meals during the holidays to some of the poorest local children is an appalling decision. I commend the campaign by Marcus Rashford and others to ensure that all children who need them get free school meals.\n\"Whilst some Tory MPs rebelled and voted in favour of free school meals, unfortunately our Conservative MP for Bosworth just votes for whatever Boris Johnson tells him to. On this issue and many other issues our Tory MP just puts Boris before Bosworth every time.\n\"I hope the government will listen to the outcry locally and nationally change it's mind and provide these free school meals. In Wales where we have a Lib Dem Education Secretary Kirsty Williams they are continuing to provide free school meals to children. Children here in England, in Hinckley and the rest of Leicestershire deserve them too. Its time the Conservative government and local Tory MPs did the right thing and supported continuing free school meals during the holidays.\"",

This is the same Eric Pickles who insists that all planning decisions should be based on sound evidence, but felt able to make a decision having never visited the area or viewed the landscape that will be destroyed forever by this decision. One certainty is that he will not have to suffer the problems that his decision has inflicted upon the residents of the Ward I represent.\nThis decision will lead to the destruction of a much loved landscape amenity. It will impose significant levels of additional traffic on a national and local road network that has been starved of investment for years. It will provide housing that serves only to encourage economic migration from the high cost housing cities of Birmingham, Coventry and Leicester.

This would allow them to buy beer on the open market at prices up to 70 per cent below what pub companies force them to pay.\n\"This is such an important issue,\" said Michael. \"Our pubs are failing and closing down because publicans are being held to ransom by the big pubcos. They are charged excessive rents and high beer prices which leaves some effectively being paid less than the minimum wage.\n\"Changing the law gives our local pubs a fighting chance. It stops large companies taking advantage and puts the tied licensee on a fairer playing field with the free of tied licensee.\n\"In Hinckley and Bosworth, we have lost so many pubs in the last 10 years. These are not just vitally important businesses employing people but they are integral parts of our community and once they are lost they are often gone forever.\n\"I am supporting the Fair Deal for Your Local amendment to this Bill because I feel so strongly about this issue. Our current MP David Tredinnick has not yet committed to supporting this important campaign I urge him to support it as the campaign has backing from MPs of all parties.\nThe new clause to the Small Business Bill shows that the market rent only option is a simple, cheap to administer and market based solution that would simply give licensees the choice as to whether to pay a fair rent only or stick with a tied agreement. This choice would force the large pub companies to ensure that their tied agreements - where tenants pay marked up prices for beer and other products and services - are competitive, fair and attractive to tenants.\nIt would only apply to the large pub companies and not the small family-run breweries.\nThe Fair Deal for Your Local campaign is backed by 10 organisations, including CAMRA, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Forum for Private Business, trade unions and licensees organisations.\nThe amendment will be voted on this Tuesday\nMore information on the campaign and the MPs supporting it can be found at http://www.fairdealforyourlocal.com/mp-supporters/",

On 23rd May, 296 Conservative MPs, including Bosworth's Conservative MP voted against publishing detailed information regarding the condition of every school building in the country. The Department for Education was given the data following the Condition Data Collection survey conducted between 2017 and 2019. After pressure from Liberal Democrat Education spokesperson Munira Wilson, the Government revealed parts of the survey data, including that: 7,158 schools in England contain at least one building component, such as a roof, door or light fittings, deemed to be \"life expired and/or at serious risk of imminent failure\"; Almost nine in 10 schools have at least one building component that has a \"major defect\" or is \"not operating as intended\". Overall, more than 240,000 fixtures and fittings were found to be defective. However, the Government has still refused to confirm if schools in Leicestershire have these defects and today voted to keep the information concealed despite a previous pledge to publish the data in full. Bosworth Liberal Democrat spokesperson Councillor Michael Mullaney said: \"It is absolutely appalling that Bosworth's MP would vote to cover up whether our school buildings are built with dangerous or 'life-expired' materials. \"Parents in Leicestershire deserve to know whether their child is being sent to a school that is safe and fit for purpose, or to a school liable to collapse at any moment. \"Leicestershire Liberal Democrats believe that investing in education is investing in our future generation. Every crumbling school is a concrete sign of years of Conservative neglect of our public services. Parents, staff and pupils have all had enough of being taken for granted.\" ENDS Notes to Editors: The Department for Education's \"Condition Data Collection\" programme, run between 2017 and 2019, sent building surveyors and engineers to inspect 22,031 state-funded schools. Each school building was divided into its constituent parts, known as \"construction types\" (e.g. \"natural slate pitched roof\") and given a grade: A (good: performing as intended) B (satisfactory: performing as intended, but exhibiting minor deterioration) C (poor: exhibiting major defects and/or not operating as intended) D (bad: life expired and/or serious risk of imminent failure). Answers to parliamentary questions tabled by Munira Wilson MP, published here and here, reveal that: Overall, over 218,000 construction types were graded C and 24,000 graded D, out of 4.21 million construction types across state schools in England. This means 5.76% of all construction types were graded C or D. 19,442 schools (88.2% of all schools that were inspected) had at least one construction type graded C. 7,158 schools had at least one construction type graded D. The Government plans to repeat the survey by inspecting all schools again before 2026. More than 2,600 schools have been inspected to date but Ministers have refused to publish a summary of the findings. Further written questions tabled by Munira Wilson MP revealed that the Department for Education is aware of 39 state-funded schools in England that have closed all or part of their school site since December 2019 because they were unsafe for pupils. Of those: 3 schools permanently closed their entire site; 5 permanently closed part of their school site; 23 temporarily closed their entire site; 8 temporarily closed part of their school site. |",

There's a cut of £89 per pupil which when combined with inflation, is expected to force a number of schools to make difficult decisions on how to provide education.\nIn May, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that the cost of providing education could rise by 8%, meaning that unless the Government provides extra funding, schools may be forced to severely cut back on resources.\nIf that wasn't enough, the Government's plan to introduce a new National Funding Formula increasingly looks like it will penalise areas like Leicestershire even further.\nLeicestershire's schools are already among the lowest funded in the Country. This triple whammy of funding cuts, cost rises and a new funding formula could force changes that would impact heavily on educational standards.\nLeicestershire Lib Dem education spokesman Councillor Geoff Welsh said: \"Leicestershire already suffers from having some of the lowest funded schools in the Country.

The Liberal Democrats are also calling for reforms to guarantee access to an NHS dentist for everyone needing urgent and emergency care, ending DIY dentistry and “dental deserts”, and the removal of VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste.\nCommenting Liberal Democrat leader of the opposition on Leicestershire County Council Michael Mullaney said:\n“The government’s plans are too little too late for local families who have been left waiting in pain struggling to get a dentist appointment.\n“It is appalling that so many children in our area are struggling to see an NHS dentist when they need to. We know that if children can’t access dental healthcare it can disrupt their eating, sleeping and learning.\n“Instead of these half-baked reforms, we need a proper rescue package for dental healthcare. That means guaranteeing access to an NHS dentist for everyone needing emergency care, boosting the number of appointments and removing VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste.”",

That is because we are all living longer and healthier as indeed we should.\nThere is a need for a fundamental new approach by the Government itself to bring together all public services, police, health, councils etc so that the available finance goes further in order to support the quality of life that we have all come to expect.\nIn Hinckley we are showing how this can be done by bringing all services under one roof, cutting costs all round and improving the level of service delivery\".",

Sticking to it would allow a vehicle to go 15% further on the same amount of fuel.\nIt would also mean that much less pollution and carbon dioxide would be produced. If every driver in Hinckley and Bosworth were to follow the 10 point plan, our area would pump out up to 24,400 tonnes of CO2 less each year.\nThe Trust is a joint venture between Government and top private companies including BP and EDF. It has found that simple measures such as inflating tyres properly can have a dramatic impact on your wallet, health and local environment.\nThe Trust also recommends driving away immediately, rather than idling, to let the engine warm up, and turning your engine off in a traffic jam as practical everyday ways to reap the benefits of lower fuel consumption.\nBosworth Liberal Democrats Parliamentary Spokesman Michael Mullaney said, \"The Energy Savings Trust's list has some great ideas for saving money and the environment. They are simple ideas that can make a big difference to the pockets of Hinckley and Bosworth residents and to local air quality.\n\"If we all made small changes to the way we do things, we can make big savings that benefit both Hinckley and Bosworth and the planet.\"\nCommenting, Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, said: \"Spending less on filling up the car would be a bonus for everyone this Christmas, but it is not only our wallets that should feel better if we all become energy-efficient drivers.\n\"The local benefits of following these simple rules can be huge, making a valuable difference to the environment and helping to reduce the impact on health from noxious exhaust fumes.\"\nThe list of proposals for greener, cheaper driving can be found at: http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Travel\nThe list:\n1. Check your revs - change up before 2,500rpm (petrol) and 2,000rpm (diesel).\n2. Anticipate road conditions and drive smoothly, avoiding sharp acceleration and heavy braking. This saves fuel and reduces accident rates.\n3. Use air conditioning sparingly as it significantly increases fuel consumption.\n4. The most efficient speed depends upon the car in question but is typically around 45 - 50mph. Faster speed will greatly increase your fuel consumption.\n5. Drive away immediately when starting from cold - idling to heat the engine wastes fuel and causes rapid engine wear.\n6. Accessories such as roof racks, bike carriers, and roof boxes significantly affect your car's aerodynamics and reduce fuel efficiency, so remember to remove them when not in use.\n7. Avoid short journeys - a cold engine uses almost twice as much fuel and catalytic converters can take five miles to become effective.\n8.

Between 80% and 95% of people living with MND will experience some communications difficulties, some losing their voice completely, before they die.\nMichael Mullaney said \"People living with MND should not be left without a voice, with no way to communicate with loved ones and professionals at a very difficult time in their lives. I was contacted by a number of people in Hinckley and Bosworth who have MND or family members with MND about this campaign and I am supportive of it. We need to see a change, and I am committed to working with the MND Association to make sure people with MND get the support and equipment they need.\"\nThe MND Association is concerned that too many people with MND are experiencing delays in getting the right support to help them communicate. In some cases people have received essential communication equipment too late, after the person has died.\nChris James, Director of External Affairs for the MND Association said \"Losing the ability to speak is one of the most distressing dimensions of MND. The help that communication aids can offer can utterly transform the last weeks and months of a person's life. Being denied them can make that time thoroughly and needlessly wretched. That's why our manifesto is calling for the next government to commit to meeting the communication challenges faced by people with MND. Action must be taken to make sure people with MND don't die without a voice.\"\nFor further information please visit www.mndassociation.org/voice",

Liberal Democrats in Hinckley and Bosworth campaigned for such a law in 2012 after St Mary's Church in Hinckley suffered £50,000 in damage after metal was stolen from the Church Roof.\nHinckley Lib Dem Councillors David Bill and Michael Mullaney wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May demanding new laws to tackle the problem.\nUnder the law, every scrap metal dealer had to obtain a licence from their local council to trade. Town halls have been able to refuse or revoke licences, have new powers of entry and inspection and the ability to shut down rogue dealers.\nIt is also now illegal for anyone to buy or sell scrap metal with cash while traders have to keep records of names and addresses of scrap metal suppliers. This is increasing traceability for all transactions and making it more difficult for thieves to sell stolen metal to scrapyards.\nCouncils across the country have been assisting the police to prosecute unlicensed traders and shut down scrap metal businesses that break the law.\nOther figures include:\nInfrastructure-related metal thefts - including from railway lines, church roofs and machinery - dropped by 41 per cent in the past year;\nThe number of metal theft offences recorded each month more than halved from 6,609 in April 2012 to under 3,000 in March 2014;\nCllr Michael Mullaney said:\"The scourge of metal theft costs the country hundreds of millions of pounds a year and has a hugely negative impact on communities, businesses and councils.\n\"It sees trains disrupted, precious memorials desecrated, church and library roofs vandalised, children's playground equipment targeted and road signs stolen. We saw the damage ourselves here in Hinckley when St Mary's Church was targetted.\n\"Such a significant drop in metal thefts is excellent news for communities who have suffered from the chaos, disruption and heartache caused by unscrupulous metal thieves.\n\"David Bill and I had been calling for new laws to help regulate the scrap metal industry in order to make it more difficult for thieves to flog their stolen goods to scrap yards and it is great to see we made the Government has done this.\"\nCllr David Bill added \"Of course any scrap metal theft is unacceptable and there is still much to do.But this is welcome news, I'm glad the new laws we called for here in Hinckley have helped tackle the blight of scrap metal theft.\"",

In Bosworth schools will get a total of £617,000 to support children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The original plans for an extra £430 per pupil have been boosted by £100m, meaning that that every school in Hinckley and Bosworth will now get nearly £500 for every child on Free School Meals.\nNews of the extra money comes after Sarah Teather recently announced that the total Pupil Premium funding for next year will rise to £1.25bn, double the amount in 2011-12. Thanks to Liberal Democrats, it will rise again each year until 2014-15 when it will be worth £2.5bn.\nCommenting, Cllr Michael Mullaney Liberal Democrat parliamentary spokesman for Bosworth said: \"It is a shocking fact that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are three times less likely to achieve five good GSCEs than their more well-off classmates. \"Education is the best way to end the underachievement of disadvantaged pupils through supporting children comprehensively from early years straight through to secondary school.\n\"That is why Liberal Democrats have ensured that in Bosworth schools will receive £617,000 as part of the Pupil Premium. \"This is more than expected and will make an even bigger difference for our children. I look forward to working with schools and teachers to make the Pupil Premium the success our children deserve it to be.\"\nCommenting further, Sarah Teather said: \"The Pupil Premium will benefit poorer pupils, providing extra money directly for those pupils who need it the most. \"This extra funding will help tackle inequality and enable schools to provide the extra support their pupils need to reach their full potential.\"",

This clearly shows that lower duty leads to growth, investment and jobs in the brewing sector and I am delighted that the chancellor has made a vote of confidence in Britain's breweries.\"\nLib Dem Parliamentary Spokesman Cllr Michael Mullaney supported the move \"It is good news for pubs, as supermarkets were able to absorb the increase in the price of beer, pubs were simply not able to and this was further increasing the difference between a can of beer in the supermarket and a pint in the pub, which is a controlled and sociable environment. So I am delighted that it has today being brought to an end.\n\"It is now essential that the benefit of scrapping the escalator are passed on to pubs. Too many pubs have closed in recent years. We now want to hear from all the large pub owning companies that they pass this on to licensees by looking at their own prices lists which will help publicans and help pub customers\".\nThe beer duty escalator is an increase in tax on beer by 2% above the rate of inflation\nintroduced in 2008 and in place until 2014/15. As a result, tax on beer has gone up by over 40% since 2008.\nThe beer duty escalator has proven damaging to brewers across the country and led to increases in beer prices. These price increases are absorbed by the supermarkets, however, pubs are simply unable to do this which can further increase the difference between a can in the supermarket and a pint in the pub and figures clearly show that people are now being put off by the price of beer in some pubs.",

The vouchers could be spent on a range of activities including tutoring in reading, writing and maths, music lessons, swimming classes or other physical education.\nThe programme would last three years, with one £200 Catch-Up Voucher provided annually for every school child in the country, in what the Liberal Democrats said would become \"the world's biggest ever parent-listening exercise.\"\n2,528 children on free school meals in Hinckley and Bosworth would be eligible for Catch-Up vouchers worth £400 a year under the proposals. This would help close the learning gap for disadvantaged children who were less likely to have the resources they needed to learn at home during the pandemic. Pupils with special educational needs who are also eligible for Free School Meals would be provided with triple vouchers worth £600 a year.\nThe ambitious plans were featured this week on BBC One and ITV as part of the Liberal Democrats' Party Political Broadcast. They would form part of a £15 billion package of education catch-up funding, or £500 per child, as recommended by the Government's former Education Recovery Commissioner Sir Kevan Collins. This is ten times more than the £50 per child being provided under the government's current plans.\nCommenting on the new scheme, Liberal Democrat parliamentary spokesman for Hinckley and Bosworth Councillor Michael Mullaney said:\n\"Children have already suffered too much during this pandemic, from not seeing their friends to missing out on school. We need to see a massive investment in helping kids catch up on this lost learning, instead of the pitiful £50 per child the government is currently offering.\n\"The Liberal Democrats' Catch-up Voucher scheme would put money directly into the hands of parents in Hinckley and Bosworth to spend on whatever their children need most. It would also provide extra cash for the families of disadvantaged children and those with special needs, to help them close the learning gap.\n\"This policy is particularly important here in Leicestershire where education spending is among the lowest in the country and contributes sadly to low levels of social mobility locally.\"\nLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey MP added:\n\"The Liberal Democrats are the party of empowering people, and supporting parents and children is our top priority in the new fair deal we are offering.\n\"Covid should mark a watershed in how we educate our children and young people.

Over many years there have been numerous proposals to build houses on the Big Pit site and these have been repeatedly turned down by the local Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council and Leicestershire County Council. There have been numerous public meetings over the years which have been well attended by residents objecting to the development and local campaigning groups such as the Big Pit Resistance Group have been formed to oppose the development.

There is clear and large opposition locally to any plans to build on this site.\n\"There continue to be concerns that the level of parking provided for the planned 60 properties would be inadequate. The proposals for parking contained in the application are flawed and the plans should be rejected because of this.\n\"Infrastructure is a real concern. There are no Section 106 monies coming with this application, this means that the local community will not get the infrastructure investment needed for local health services and other local services which will see increased demand if this development goes ahead.\n\"Drainage and fears of flooding continue to be a huge concern for local residents living in the area around the Big Pit site. There are natural springs in the area and the Big Pit has quickly filled up with water again when it has been drained in the past. To build on the Big Pit site carries the risk of making flooding in the area worse for people living in properties nearby.\n\"The development is also likely to put large numbers of lorry movements onto Ashby Road, in order to fill the Big Pit in.

There are already problems with flooding in the area which building on the Big Pit will make worse, the proposals do not provide adequate parking spaces for the number of cars likely to be owned by the people living in the 60 properties.\n\"The plans to build on the Big Pit are flawed and I would ask the Planning Inspector to turn down the latest plans to build on the Big Pit.\"",

They have been struggling for months, often relying on foodbanks to feed themselves and the people they care for.\n\"So Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to support carers by raising Carer's Allowance by £1,000 a year, now.\"\nLocal statistics on the number of claimants eligible for and receiving Carer's Allowance in May 2020 are available from stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk.\nFull text of Ed Davey's letter to the Prime Minister:\nDear Prime Minister,\nI am writing to follow up my question to you about Carer's Allowance in the House of Commons on Monday 2nd November, as you indicated you would get back to me.\nThank you for your commitment to look at my proposal to raise Carer's Allowance by £20 a week, in line with the uplift in Universal Credit. I would like to set out the case in more detail here.\nUnpaid carers are doing a remarkable and important job in very difficult circumstances. They deserve our support.\nCarers face big challenges every single day - challenges that have been made even harder by coronavirus. A recent survey of more than 5,000 carers by Carers UK found that most are having to spend more time looking after loved ones during this pandemic. Most haven't been able to take a single break since it started. Most are simply exhausted.\nOn top of all this, many carers are facing extreme financial hardship. More than 900,000 full-time unpaid carers rely on Carer's Allowance - but at just £67.25 a week, it's just not nearly enough.\nIndeed, the survey found that more than a third of those on Carer's Allowance are struggling just to make ends meet. Many have been struggling for months, often relying on foodbanks to feed themselves and the people they care for. Carers UK found that \"43% of carers felt that a rise in Carer's Allowance would help them, given the financial pressures they are facing.\"\nSo, on behalf of these carers, I urge you to support unpaid carers by immediately raising Carer's Allowance by £20 a week, the same as the uplift in Universal Credit.\nI understand that 75 carers organisations have also written to the Work and Pensions Secretary and the Chancellor calling for an increase in Carer's Allowance through an additional supplement. They also call for accompanying rises in Carer Premium and Carer Addition, and an equivalent payment to be made to carers with an underlying entitlement to Carer's Allowance, so older carers on low incomes also receive it.\nI urge you to implement these policies, as well as their proposal that payments should be backdated to recognise the incredible contributions of unpaid carers - and the extra challenges they have faced - during this pandemic.\nIn addition, the organisations call for the earnings limit for eligibility for Carer's Allowance to be raised from £128 a week to at least £139.52, so that more carers can benefit from it. Liberal Democrats have long been calling for the earnings limit to be raised, so I urge you to do that as well.\nI am sure you will agree that we must do far more to support our wonderful carers, and build a more caring society as we emerge from this pandemic.\nI look forward to your response.\nYours sincerely,\nEd Davey MP\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats",

There are around two million businesses in the UK that have nine employees or less. We can therefore be very confident that this proposal would allow many small British businesses the breathing space they need in a tough economic environment.

A single authority for Leicestershire will create an authority of around three quarters of a million people. People tell me they already feel that decision making is too remote from their everyday lives. How much more remote will it seem if decision making is taken by such a large authority?\n“The message from the government which the County Council is echoing with it’s plans for one Council for all of Leicestershire is that big is better. The government seems to think that with local government in huge financial difficulty it can make councils that are too big to fail. But we remember that Birmingham City Council financially failed and it was the largest council in Europe.\n“Scrapping all Boroughs and Districts will mean the loss of local knowledge. Local housing teams often know many of the tenants in their areas. Local borough councils do lots of work with local voluntary and community groups. It’s this local knowledge that risks being lost if we see a huge Mega Council created.\n“Leicestershire County Council as set out in it’s budget statement today is facing a deficit of nearly £100 million by 2028/29.\n“It is certainly the case that local government is in financial difficulty across the country. But is scrapping all Boroughs and District Councils and creating huge Unitary Councils the answer?\n“The government seems to think that single county Unitary Councils will be more financially viable. Yet Shropshire which scrapped its districts some years ago to create one Unitary for the whole of Shropshire has said loudly recently that it is near financial collapse. So clearly getting rid of Borough and District Council and creating huge Unitary Councils in there place is not a guaranteed solution to the problems of local government finance.\n“The government seems keen on these plans to scrap boroughs and districts and create huge Mega councils to save money.\n“Yet the evidence for this is very uncertain. There have been local government reorganisations recently in Cumbria and Somerset, these ran into the costs of 10s of millions of pounds. To now do this to the rest of England to abolish all Boroughs and Districts in the whole country is likely to costs 100s of millions if not billions of pounds to do.\n“It will also cause huge disruption, it will mean council officers spending all their time preparing for re organisation of Councils rather than delivering services for local residents.\n“I and the Liberal Democrats believe that the plans to scrap all the Boroughs and Districts in Leicestershire to create one Mega authority would be a disaster. It would mean local government no longer being local. It will mean decision making being more remote from people’s everyday lives. It will mean many discretionary local services that local Boroughs and District Councils like Hinckley and Bosworth currently provide like the programme of local events and support for voluntary and community groups being lost.\n“It will mean huge disruption as people have to prepare for the old councils being abolished and the new mega council being created. It means the potential loss of local knowledge where local council officers who know their local areas being lost. It will cost a huge amount of money without guaranteeing any real savings.\n“Scrapping the Boroughs and Districts in Leicestershire and creating a single Mega Council for the County is wrong. These plans should be dropped and we in the Lib Dem group will continue to oppose them tooth and nail.”",

Here in Hinckley and Bosworth we have eight local Libraries under threat. Desford, Barwell, Burbage, Newbold Verdon, Markfield, Ratby, Groby and Market Bosworth could be closed by Conservative run Leicestershire County Council.\n\"The County Council are saying that if volunteers can't be found to run these Libraries they will close.\n\"It would be a tragedy to lose these important community facilities, especially as many of these villages have lost other services and amenities over the years.\n\"These threats to Libraries are unlikely to even save much money. The County Council wants to save £800,000 through closing these Libraries. But one of them, Newbold Verdon, was built recently with over £700,000 from the Big Lottery Fund which the County may have to pay back if they close it. This would wipe out almost all the savings and so it would be all pain with virtually no gain.\n\"I hope Conservative run Leicestershire County Council have a rethink and keep the Libraries open.\"\nLocal Author Stewart Bint said \"How can our County Council live with themselves by wanting to deny people's access to books? It's akin to the book-burning regimes which litter history.\n\"Desford Library also provides free internet for people who aren't online at home.\n\"The County Council are attempting to remove a vital public service and they should be ashamed of themselves. Not everyone can afford books, and the library is used by people who otherwise would have no access to books or the internet.\n\"The Government is pledging to provide broadband for everyone and these\nCounty Councillors are trying to take it away. As an author I am dismayed by this attack on many people's only source of books, education and knowledge.\n\"It will hit people in their pockets as they'll have to catch a bus to visit a library. We pay our Council Tax for the County Council to provide a service to us. And here they are imposing their ill-thought-out will on us. Desford Library is only open 15 hours a week as it is, and closes for two full days in the week.\n\"The County Council are hardly providing an a dequate service now. Libraries have their origins in 1464 and have been widespread and popular since the mid 19th Century. Will this County Council go down in history as being the ones who lost this essential part of the English heritage on their watch? It's disgraceful.\"",

This includes 160,000 wage subsidies and 250,000 new work experience placements.\nA new programme will help 16 and 17 year olds who are not in employment, education or training.

This would mean the abolition of the seven district and Boroughs in the county. The meeting supported Tory council leader Nick Rushton writing to the government on behalf of the county council to signal to government their wish to press on with one unitary authority for the county.\nThis is in line with similar moves being pushed on towards Unitaries by Conservative county council leaderships in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.

I hope the Conservative bosses at County Hall rethink and drop these centralising, disruptive, plans to abolish the Leicestershire districts and Boroughs.\n\"Rather than abolishing districts and boroughs the Tory County Council and our counties seven Tory MPs should be lobbying their government to bring in fair funding for Leicestershire. At present we are the worst funded area for local government by the Conservative government. This is understandably putting pressure on our local services.

It means 115,437 pensioners in Leicestershire will benefit from an increase in their pension.\nThis rise will bring the level of the state pension to at least £115.95 and will benefit millions of pensioners across the UK. This is £18.30 more, each week, than in 2010 when the Liberal Democrats entered coalition. This means pensioners on the full basic state pension are £950 a year better off than they were under Labour.\nThe triple lock delivers a pension rise of whichever is the greater of average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, meaning pensioners across Leicestershire will see more money in their pockets.\nThe Liberal Democrats campaigned for it in opposition, have delivered it in Government and have pledged to write it into law in the next Parliament.\nCommenting, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary spokesman for Bosworth Cllr Michael Mullaney said:\n\"This is fantastic news and proof that the Liberal Democrats are delivering in government.\n\"Thanks to the triple lock commitment in our manifesto pensioners across the country have benefited from a substantial income boost this parliament.\n\"I am proud of this record of delivery and that we are the only party with a 2015 manifesto promise to write the triple lock into law.\"\n\"Liberal Democrats are building a stronger economy and a fairer society, and that means treating pensioners with the respect that they deserve.\n\"The triple lock ensures that pensioners are guaranteed the security of a steady rise in their pensions, allowing them to plan for their future and giving them dignity in their retirement.\n\"We have ensured that in Bosworth and the rest of Britain never again will pensioners get an insulting 75p increase as they did under Gordon Brown.\"",

It shows sewage was dumped into local rivers on 1,242 separate occasions in 2023.\nThis is a shocking 125% rise in the duration of sewage spills compared to the previous year, showing how the sewage scandal has worsened under the Conservative government’s watch.\nSewage was dumped into England’s rivers over 460,000 times for a total of over 3.6 million hours in 2023.\nIt comes after the Liberal Democrats local election success where the party campaigned relentlessly on sewage and the local environment. The party gained over 100 seats and control of two councils, beating the Conservatives and coming second for the first time since 1996. In Burbage the Liberal Democrats took the County Council seat from the Conservatives on a huge 14% swing.\nThe Liberal Democrats have led the way in campaigning against sewage dumping for years. The party is calling for strict measures including replacing Ofwat with a tougher regulator, a ban on bonuses for water company bosses whose firms have dumped sewage into waterways and the declaration of a national environmental emergency.\nLiberal Democrat parliamentary spokesman for Hinckley and Bosworth Councillor Michael Mullaney said:\n“It is disgusting that Severn Trent Water pumped their filthy sewage into our waterways so many times last year.\n“On doorstep after doorstep, people in Hinckley and Bosworth told me how furious they were that filthy sewage had been pumped into their rivers and waterways - they want to send this Conservative government a message.\n“The Liberal Democrats have led the way for years in campaigning for tougher action. We want to see a tougher water regulator, an end to bonuses for polluting water company bosses and stronger protections for our local environment.\n“Come the General Election, Liberal Democrats will be campaigning hard against this national scandal that has been allowed to take hold while the Conservative Government has sat on its hands and looked the other way.”",

Postponing the fuel duty rise is the right thing to do to support families at a time when they need help.\n\"While the oil price is falling, the Coalition Government has ensured all of the savings can be passed on to families at the pump.\n\"These savings come on top of the money provided by the Coalition Government for councils to freeze Council Tax, which Hinckley and Bosworth has done, and the Income Tax cuts every year for ordinary working families, which has meant a total Income Tax cut of £550. Thanks to this decision by Liberal Democrats in the Coalition Government, no one will pay any Income Tax over the first £10,000 they earn by 2015. \"\nCommenting further, Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander said:\n\"Labour's legacy to British families was year-on-year rises in fuel taxes and when we came into government, the Liberal Democrats rightly put a stop to this.\n\"Thanks to decisions this Coalition Government has taken, fuel tax is 10p a litre lower than it would have been had we stuck to Labour's plans.\"",

Across Hinckley and Bosworth it would save residents £81million in fuel costs.

This would include doubling the Warm Homes Discount to £300 and extending it to all those on Universal Credit and Pension Credit, while investing in insulating fuel poor homes to bring prices down in the long term.\nLiberal Democrat parliamentary spokesman for Hinckley and Bosworth Councillor Michael Mullaney said:\n\"Hard-working families in Hinckley and Bosworth are already struggling to make ends meet, and are deeply concerned about how they will cope with the predicted rise in energy bills.\n\"This Conservative Government is stalling in the face of a national emergency and, yet again, is simply not doing enough to put money back in the pockets of hard-working people.\n\"Countless families and pensioners across Hinckley and Bosworth are already struggling, and they cannot wait for a new Conservative leader to act.\n\"This is an emergency, and the Government must step in now to help families and pensioners in Hinckley and Bosworth by cancelling the planned rise in energy bills this October.\"\nThe price cap is currently £1,971 a year for a typical household. It went up by £693 (54%) in April. The new cap is expected to be around £3,400 - an increase of around £1,400 or 70%. Cancelling the rise would mean the energy bill for a typical household stays at £1,971 a year, instead of rising to around £3,400 in October.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for Ofgem not to increase the price cap. Instead, the Government would pay suppliers the shortfall of what they would've been charging if the cap had increased, so they can afford to continue supplying their customers.\nWe estimate that cancelling the rise would cost around £36 billion. This is based on Cornwall Insight's latest forecasts for the new price cap, and the number of electricity and gas meters in Great Britain. A proper Windfall Tax could raise around £20 billion to help keep people's energy bills from rising in October. Fossil fuel giants have seen their profits soar: BP and Shell made £29 billion in profits in the first six months of the year alone.\nThe Government should also use the extra VAT revenues it is receiving as a result of inflation. It took in £11 billion more in VAT last fiscal year (2021-22) than it was expecting in March 2021, and is now expected to take in an extra £9 billion this year and £10 billion next year compared to last year's forecasts. That's a £30 billion VAT windfall that the Government should be using to help families and pensioners.\nThe Liberal Democrats are also calling for additional help to support the most vulnerable households. This includes:\nReinstating the £20-a-week Universal Credit uplift and making it permanent, giving 4.7 million households extra help to keep their heating on.\nDoubling the Warm Homes Discount and extending it to all those on Universal Credit and Pension Credit, to take £300 a year off the heating bills of around 7.5 million vulnerable and low income households.\nDoubling the Winter Fuel Allowance, giving up to £600 a year to 11.3 million elderly pensioners to help with their heating bills.\nAn emergency home insulation programme to cut people's energy bills, starting with homes in or at risk of fuel poverty.",

Lack of dental appointments is contributing to this lack of early diagnosis. Meaning more people sadly getting mouth cancer and putting more strain on the NHS\n\"For their good health people need easier access to affordable dental care.

We don't want to see anymore bank branches close. We have also seen TSB today announce mass planned bank closures.

This includes many elderly customers who will struggle to travel long distances to bank branches in other towns or cities if they don't drive. Also we don't want to see closures of important services on our town's high streets.\"\n\"It was good that Lib Dem and Labour councillors backed the motion to try and save local bank branches.

She went through a world war, she ran a hospital and rode across Africa on her moped at a time before the first modern electronic digital Anasoff-Berry computer had even been thought of. Now she lives alone, her grasp of the internet is limited and internet banking is impossible for her. For her, now a trip to the bank means going to Nuneaton or Leicester. She no longer drives, couldn't catch a bus and taxi ride would cost £13.00 each way, all to do the most basic of human rights have access to a person at a bank.\n\"I wish this was an isolated case it isn't. Not only does this affect our older residents, and let's not forget Hinckley has an older than average age of resident, but also those struggling with physical and mental health issues who either don't have access a computer or are unable to use one.\n\"Also the impact on small business as ATMs close (we have lost over 3,300 machines since the start of 2020) and for those still wanting to pay in cash, my mum being one of there are fewer places to get that cash and fewer places for business's to deposit this cash as local branches close.\n\"So it is my privilege to call on my colleagues across all parties to back this motion and not only put people before profit but ask this government to back business the economy of our towns and villages.\"",

As a result, whenever resources are under pressure, mental health is the first to lose out.\n4) Too many mentally ill people are being shunted around the country in search of a bed - a practice which would never be tolerated in physical health.\n5) Too few people who lose their jobs are having the mental health impact of unemployment taken into account, and so lack treatment that might help get them back into work.\n6) Too many people are still ending up in police cells rather than hospital when going through a mental health crisis.\n7) Too many people are inappropriately in prison essentially because they suffer mental ill health or have a learning disability or autism.\n8) We remain deeply concerned that people with long-term mental health conditions live on average 20 years less than the general population.\n9) It is very troubling that certain ethnic groups, particularly African-Caribbean and African - are over-represented in acute mental health services and locked and secure services. People from these backgrounds face more frequent use of coercion, suffer more use of physical restraint, end up in contact with the police more often than others and have less access to talking therapies.\n10) Vital research to gain a better understanding of mental illness and to establish the most effective treatments is compromised by inadequate funding. Whilst cancer and mental ill health both account for about 15% of disease burden, mental health only gets about 5% of research funding.\nThe full list of signatories can be found here: http://equality4mentalhealth.uk/http://equality4mentalhealth.uk/",

The increase in apprenticeships in the Bosworth constituency was the 2nd biggest in the entire country.\nApprenticeships in the Bosworth constituency more than doubled from 390 in 2009/10 to 1,050 in 2010/11. Only West Harrow recorded a bigger increase in England.\nLiberal Democrat parliamentary spokesman for Bosworth Cllr Michael Mullaney welcomed the news.

Offering employers with up to 50 employees an incentive payment of £1,500 to take on apprentices aged 16-24. This will encourage small employers to take on up to 20,000 apprentices.\n2. Streamlining processes so that it takes just a month for an employer to advertise for an apprentice.\n3. Ensuring that the National Apprenticeship Service better supports the needs of small employers - through more effectively targeted advice and guidance and helping training providers work more effectively with local SMEs.\nCommenting further, Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, Vince Cable said:\n\"The apprenticeships programme is a success story, with record numbers of learners starting an apprenticeship this year. But I have listened to employers, and will go further to ensure that investment is targeted where impact is greatest, delivering the specific skills businesses need to drive growth.\n\"Apprenticeships are proven to boost the life chances of young people, and are a sound investment in our future competitiveness.

The measure would prevent pensioners being forced to \"choose between eating and heating this winter\", say the Lib Dems.\nThe call comes amid fears that local residents, particularly the nearly 2,000 pensioners on low incomes, could be at risk from the energy crisis this winter.\nThe Warm Home Discount, funded by energy firms, is due to give people £140 off their electricity bill this winter. It is available to those who receive the 'Guarantee Credit' element of pension credit as well as some people on low incomes, with around two million receiving it each year across the UK.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to take on the cost of the Warm Home Discount and immediately double its value to £280, helping pensioners cope with soaring bills this winter.\nCurrently 212,660 is spent on the Warm Home Discount in Hinckley and Bosworth. Under Liberal Democrat plans this funding would rise to 547,680.\nCommenting on the new scheme, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary spokesman for HInckley and Bosworth Michael Mullaney said:\n\"The Conservatives are pushing the most vulnerable pensioners and families into a cost of living crisis. We are seeing a double whammy of rising bills and the slashing of vital support.\n\"Residents in Hinckley and Bosworth should not have to choose between heating and eating this winter.

The centre, if built, has the potential to address some of our concerns here in Barwell. It will contain a library, sport facilities, meeting rooms and a youth facility. However, Sandra Francks has recently written to officers at County Council to raise concerns over its size, running costs and funding. A management Committee is to be formed to run the new facility.",

Whilst the County Council is addressing shorter-distance journeys, little has been done to deliver improvements to longer distance journeys to neighbouring cities.\n\"With key areas of growth in Barwell, Earl Shilton, Stoney Stanton and Sapcote there is an opportunity to enhance journeys to Leicester, Birmingham and Coventry through the re-opening of a station near Elmesthorpe.\nCllr Michael Mullaney Lib Dem parliamentary spokesman for Bosworth said \"Lib Dems in Hinckley & Bosworth and Blaby are campaigning to re-open Elmesthorpe station to help provide new journey opportunities. Railways provide a primary means of transport, and are particularly important as they enable young people especially to travel to work without encountering the prohibitive cost of motor car insurance.\"\nDavid Bill said \"Councillors have been working with Network Rail and Cross Country Trains to secure a long term vision for the area. The reopening of Elmesthorpe station even as a halt would benefit local commuters.\"\nWording of the Motion Proposed by Councillor David Gould, \"This Council requests that the Chief Executive respond to each and every consultation relating to the Birmingham-Leicester line requesting the opening of a station at Elmesthorpe to serve the communities of Barwell and Earl Shilton.

That was a disgrace and we're bringing it to an end.\n\"The premium gives Headteachers in our area the freedom to use the money how they want, in the ways they know work - not how politicians in Whitehall tell them to.\"\n\"By helping some of the most disadvantaged children, we can help whole classes work together better and move forward faster. This is great news for children, parents and teachers alike.\"\nMichael Mullaney added \"The Pupil Premium was one of four policies on the front of the Liberal Democrat manifesto at the last election. I am delighted that it is now becoming a reality.\n\"The evidence shows that the best way to help bright kids from poor families get to university is to target additional resources at them when they are younger and so give them a head start in life.\"",

When the 1 and 2 were scrapped I was contacted by many elderly residents in Hinckley, Barwell and Earl Shilton who could no longer catch the buses. Whilst the 1 and 2 bus services stopped near their homes the other bus services only stopped on main roads in Hinckley, Barwell and Earl Shilton which were often a long walk from their homes.\n“Equally the scrapping of the 159 Hinckley to Coalville service was the only bus service that a number of villages like Stapleton and Cadeby had. It was also the only service that linked places like Barlestone, Market Bosworth and Newbold Verdon to Hinckley, which made it convenient for people needing to do shopping and banking in the town.\n“When the government said that it was cancelling HS2 stage 2 it said the money would be spent on bus and rail services in the Midlands and the North. Given that Leicestershire is the worst funded County in the country by the government it’s only fair that we get a fair share of this transport money for our local bus services.\n“I have written to Leicestershire County Council requesting that part of the money for transport being given by the government go towards putting the numbers 1, 2 and 159 buses back on the road. Money from the government’s Bus Service Improvement Plan could be directed at getting these essential services restored. I have been in contact with bus operators who are potentially interested in running the services if they are restored.\n“Bringing back the numbers 1,2 and 159 bus services would be welcome news for many residents in Hinckley, Barwell, Earl Shilton and local villages.”",

But now, we're hearing they may renege on that pledge using the pandemic as political cover.\n\"That would be an unforgivable betrayal of our young people.\n\"We Liberal Democrats will hold Ministers' feet to the fire on this until they meet the financial commitment they made.\"",

Warwickshire County Council went ahead and approved this planning application despite these objections. My reaction is outlined at the bottom of page 51 and at the top of page 52 of the attached report which went to the Development Control meeting at Leics County Council last week.\nAt the meeting I repeated these concerns and expressed the hope that Veolia will recognise their responsibility to be good neighbours to the 600 or more households who make up the Waterside Park area. I am grateful to the Planning Officers at Leics County Council who have drawn up a legal agreement to protect these residents from the noise of tipping in the evenings. Their assessment is outlined on page 53 of the report. This legal agreement should ensure that the noisy tipping does not extend into the evenings but the failure on the part of Warwickshire County Council to consult people on this side of the border has not been a friendly act on their part."
