  "https_www_liz4littletons_co_uk/https_www_liz4littletons_co_uk_introduction/content_2.html": "I'm #LizWilliams, your #ReformUK🇬🇧 Candidate for #Littletons #Worcestershire.\nI cover the following villages.\n#Blackminster, #Bickmarsh #Bretforton #BroadMarston #CleevePrior, #Honeybourne, #LongLartin #Offenham, #Pebworth, #MiddleLittleton, #NorthLittleton, #SouthLittleton, #Ullington\nI hope to represent you, as a County Councillor , if you choose to elect me, on 01 May 2025, in our County Councillor Elections.\nWhy vote for me?\nI WILL\nFight For You ☑️\nFight For Farmers ☑️\nFight For Crime Reduction ☑️\nFight For Value For Money ☑️\nFight For Our Most Vulnerable ☑️\nI've lived in Worcestershire most of my life and went to school in Pershore. I love our area and am extremely proud of its heritage.\nI want to make living here, even better than it is now, for all of us.\nThis is my promise to you 👇\n☑️I will fight for YOU ! I promise to listen to your concerns and act on them wherever possible 🇬🇧\nPlease do contact me regarding any issues you are facing in our local area, or indeed nationally, you feel may be relevant. I want to hear from you. You can email me at liz4littletons@gmail.com.\n☑️I will speak for YOUR #Housing needs first🇬🇧\nMy 35 years experience and expertise in land, property and construction, as well as housing needs, has allowed me to earn a national stage commenting on strategy and policy. In particular I comment and write in the press on s106 Affordable Housing. I can, and I will, speak out to ensure local housing needs come first, in county development policies, and with our county, regionally and nationally.\n☑️I will fight for Farmers! 🇬🇧\nI grew up in the Countryside, and in #Farming, and never left. I still laugh at my one brother's first words being \"muck\". It breaks my heart and enrages me to see #Farmers struggling so badly, that they have the worst suicide rates ever seen. I will fight for our Farmers before it becomes too late. I will get you the support you need. I'm an expert in Compulsory Purchase consultation and opposition. I will fight the Land Grab to keep every inch of farmland in our Vale farming, now, and for the future.\n☑️I will demand more Law Enforcement 🇬🇧\nCrime is rising here. I've never seen such appalling violence and danger in our villages. It must be stopped. It is clear things are out of control and our police under resourced. As council tax payers we deserve to be protected and to feel safe. We pay for that. It's time more transparency is provided and we feel protected, safe and secure. I will demand answers and most importantly action. I will address the life threatening speeding, home invasions and vehicle thefts that are blighting our lives. I will bring our communities together to fight crime through neighbourhood initiatives. I will not accept fear is normal.\n☑️ I will demand our infrastructure is safe, sufficient, fit for purpose and Value For Money 🇬🇧\nAs a qualified construction expert in housebuilding, I have a technical insight of what infrastructure and local services really matter to local communities. I know how to consult respectfully, how to take views and provide negotiated solutions and how to fund what an area needs. Most importantly I know how to build it, and ensure actual value for money, through expert cost control and project management. I'm extremely experienced in dealing with flooding issues, road and sewer adoptions and environmental issues. No more waste, a lot more provision, and not at the expense of our natural environment.\n☑️I will support our Local Businesses 🇬🇧\nI've worked in the private sector for most of my career. I mentor business owners on business planning and marketing strategies. I understand how this Government's decisions have destroyed those plans. I will not stand by and watch local businesses be destroyed and jobs lost. I will fight to keep, support and create new businesses and jobs, by ensuring County support is there and accessible.\n☑️I will fight for our most Vulnerable 🇬🇧\nI believe our Government is hurting the most vulnerable in our society. I believe they are doing this because they do not value us and are hell bent on forcing our elderly, disabled and vulnerable families into more poverty and harm. I do not believe they care one iota. I promise to ensure Social Care and Education provides fit for purpose, affordable and appropriate care for our most vulnerable. I will not allow anyone in the Littletons to be abandoned. As a Veteran I will defend those who have also served and now need our protection.\n🚨All the other parties have failed you 🚨\nThey have failed me. I will not allow this to shape our future. I will fight for all of us and for Reform UK. Our Council is broken and only Reform can fix it.\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\nLiz Williams\nReform Uk Candidate Littletons - 01 May 2025 Worcestershire County Councillor Elections",
