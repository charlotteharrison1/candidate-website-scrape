  "http_www_rebeccapow_org_uk_/http_www_rebeccapow_org_uk_news_rebecca-welcomes-uk-wide-ban-wet-wipes-containing-plastic/content_10.html": "Caption: Taunton Deane MP Rebecca Pow visited Tops Day Nursery at Musgrove Park Hospital in February 2023 and met with Nursery Manager Chanelle Cochrane to see first-hand how nursery staff make their own environmentally friendly wet wipes.\nRebecca Pow MP welcomes UK-wide ban on wet wipes containing plastic\nThe UK Government will introduce new world-leading legislation to ban wet wipes containing plastic, the Environment Secretary has confirmed.\nDefra intend to bring forward the legislation for England ahead of summer recess, with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales following by the autumn as part of an aligned approach to bring the ban into force. Wet wipes containing plastic break down into microplastics over time, which research shows can be harmful to human health and disrupt our ecosystems – with a recent survey showing an average of 20 wet wipes were found per 100 metres of beach surveyed across the UK.\nOnce in our water environment, wet wipes containing plastic can accumulate biological and chemical pollutants, increasing the risk of harm to the animals and humans who encounter them. Banning them will reduce plastic and microplastic pollution and reduce the volume of microplastics entering wastewater treatment sites when wrongly flushed – meaning our beaches and waterways will benefit from the ban.\nResponses to the public consultation showed overwhelming support for the proposed ban – which will be introduced via secondary legislation under our Environmental Protection Act 1990 – with 95% of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing with the proposals. The government’s response has been published alongside the Welsh Government, Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive.\nMarking Earth Day 2024, with its theme of ‘Planet vs. Plastics’, the response sets out next steps to deliver the ban, building on action taken across the UK to tackle plastic pollution.\nTaunton Deane MP Rebecca Pow said:\n“Legislating for a ban on wet wipes containing plastics is absolutely the right thing to do and I welcome this announcement. I have called for this consistently; starting a campaign on this as a backbencher and in my capacity as the former Water Minister, I prioritised this ban in the Government’s Plan for Water.\nWet wipes containing plastics break down into smaller and smaller pieces when in the water environment and can have an unacceptable negative impact on our precious ecosystems. While wastewater treatment works remove up to 99% of microplastics, due to the high volume of microplastics entering the sewerage system, even just 1% can still cause damage to the environment.\nActions to stop microplastics entering the water system in the first place are critical which is why I welcome this ban wholeheartedly. It is a vital and welcome addition to our previous ban on cosmetic and wash off care products containing plastics, which I also called for and clearly demonstrates our determination to clean up our waters and reduce plastics in the environment.”\nEnvironment Secretary Steve Barclay said:\n“Wet wipes containing plastic are polluting our waterways and causing microplastics to enter the environment. Defra will introduce legislation before the summer recess to crack down on this unnecessary source of pollution, following our successful single-use carrier bag charge and ban on microbeads in personal care products. I have been clear that a step change is needed to protect our waterways from pollution. The ban builds on a raft of actions already taken to protect our waterways and hold water companies accountable - including accelerating investment, putting water company fines back into the environment and quadrupling the number of inspections of water company sites.”",

It employs around 2,300, with a predicted 50% growth by 2025. A further 8,300 are employed in seasonal/part time work.\nTaunton Deane MP Rebecca Pow said:\n“Many people are surprised to learn that in real terms we have 934 vineyards and 209 wineries in England and Wales – many of them producing award-winning wine. English sparkling wines are now considered outstanding internationally and in Somerset alone we have 31 vineyards with around 68 hectares under vine, that are employing people and investing in our county.”\nChief executive of WineGB Nicola Bates added:\n“The sector is at a critical point in its journey. Partnership working with government can be impactful for growers and producers. As the fastest growing agricultural industry, with highly skilled jobs in the vineyards, wineries and cellar doors, we are levelling up the countryside. We look forward to shaping the regulatory and economic conditions that will enable our wines to thrive and to encourage more sales through tourism, retail, local hospitality and export.”",

Over that time, we have achieved so much for our area but there’s still more to do. Huge progress has been made since I have been your MP. I have also been proud to be a Government Minister for much of this time which has in itself brought significant benefits for the constituency in being able to secure unprecedented investment locally as well as benefiting the area on key issues such as farming, the environment and water (securing the bathing water status on French Weir for example and large peat restoration schemes on the Somerset Levels.)\nConscious that money in peoples’ pockets is all important Government have taken sound action on the economy including bringing inflation down dramatically. This has enabled tax cuts for 28m working people - by reducing National Insurance by £900 for the average worker which has been welcomed by many in my conversations on the doors. The Government have also just announced ‘Triple Lock Plus’ which will cut tax for pensioners by increasing the personal allowance in line with the triple lock facilitating a tax cut of around £100 for 8 million pensioners.\nSince being elected back in 2015 I have worked hard to ensure that your voices are heard in Westminster and delivered many projects benefitting our community. This includes the restoration of the iconic Wellington Monument where I secured the initial £1 million and thanks to tremendous input from a myriad of people over the years, the Monument is open once again for all to enjoy.\nRetaining our precious Royal Marines at Norton Manor Camp mattered to so many of you and in 2019, following the comprehensive case I made to the then Defence Secretary, the future of the base was secured and acknowledged in writing by Lt Col Paul Maynard at the time. Contrary to leaflets being put out this was not achieved by my political opponents.\nMy pledge to upgrade Taunton rail station has been realised and similarly, I committed to bringing a rail station to Wellington; and thanks to my hard-working team, support from Government with over £5m, we are on track to deliver this but retaining me as our MP is critical to this.\nSecuring a complete rebuild for our valued Selworthy Special School has been welcome indeed. It arose out of the RAAC concerns and working with the school and the Education Department a complete upgrade has been agreed. I promise to see this through.\nEnsuring local people get high-quality healthcare has been a priority from the get go and we’ve seen real progress: working closely with Somerset NHS Foundation Trust at Musgrove Park Hospital a new £11.5m surgical decision unit is already up and running and the £87m new surgical centre is being built right now. I’ve also secured commitment for a complete upgrade of the whole site by 2030 and have been working to fast forward the new maternity unit. I would not want to see this potentially jeopardised with a change of government. As usual, my local political opponents are calling for things already underway, while what I’m focused on is actually delivering.\nIf I am returned after the General Election, I will work to see projects that are underway through, as well as many wider initiatives I know will make our wonderful constituency an even better place to work and live. This includes ensuring our farmers are supported to provide the food we need and to restore nature; continuing to clean up our waters; building the homes we need, continuing my anti-social behaviour forum and providing the skills and training for the jobs of the future we are securing here thanks to a Government with a clear plan and clear action to deliver a secure future for us all.",
