Kerry runs her own social\nmedia consultancy, is a life coach and does work at a special needs school in\nAnlaby.

She’s\nhosted a pop-up café and has run women’s circles. Her two sons are members of\nlocal grassroots football and rugby clubs.\nAfter her successful selection, Kerry said:\n“To make this so-called devolution work, it has to be about all the people in Hull and\nthe East Riding, not just about big corporations. What do they want from their new\nMayor?\n“I run my own business, work in special needs education, am a certified coach and\ntraining towards a counselling qualification, and one important skill that binds all of\nthese roles together is ‘to listen’.\n“Listen to your customers, your suppliers, your employees, your colleagues and so\non. That way success comes that benefits everyone.\n“And this is also why I am going to spend the next few months listening to people\nacross our communities. Of course, l have my own views on climate change and\nsocial justice, for example, but I also want to engage with people and to understand\ntheir priorities.\n“A new Mayor has the opportunity to provide a fresh start for our communities by\nrethinking the way we do things. It shouldn’t be about reheating old policies and\nrecycling second hand politicians.”",

There are important reasons why I’ve made that decision.\n“We’re now looking at a further period of austerity when communities in Hull are barely recovering from the original round of cuts in the Cameron-Clegg years.\n“This is aside from ongoing welfare cuts such as the child benefit cap, the demonising of migrants and the rowing back on social and climate justice policies. The Green Party’s policy of asking the very wealthy to pay more in tax has to be a better way forward than more austerity.\n“It’s clear that people in Hull are desperate for a fresh start in the way we do our politics, and I firmly believe Kerry can provide that opportunity.”\nGary Wareing is the leader of the 3 member Independent group on Hull City Council which is the Council’s third largest group.

We propose therefore that drivers of electric vehicles should not pay a toll or at least have the cost substantially reduced.”\nSally Horscroft added:\n“There are great synergies between the two sides of the Humber as the usage of the bridge shows and we vow to work closely together should we be elected on 1 May.\nAlthough there’s not a single administration linking us together you can be sure that the two Green Mayors will meet regularly to discuss what is best for our communities by collaborating together.”",
