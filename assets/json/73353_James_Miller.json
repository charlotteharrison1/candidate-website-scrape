Kudos and my respect for that party continues to grow despite my fundamental opposition to a number of their policies such as ULEZ, abolishing our grammar schools and 20mph on every road throughout Southend.\nThe non-aligned independents also maintained their dignity and their true nature of being independent.\nThe Independent Group, on the other hand, continue to defy their name and mis-lead the public as they play kingmakers as coalition partners. Cllr Terry has been raging all year that Southend residents must pay more to park on the seafront as he turns visitors into villains, instead of the reality that they are paying his wages. With Terry fixated on re-introducing 6pm to 9pm charges, I had challenged Cllr Cowan, pre-election, to deny whether a Cabinet position for Terry wasn’t on offer in exchange of the Independent Group’s support based on Labour's support of this policy - all flatly denied. But can you believe it, it’s happened! A deal done in the name of putting power first.\nWhilst Labour have made history in Southend for becoming the largest party, Southend Labour should have won by a landslide given the immovable unpopularity of the national Tories. Perhaps it was because of their policy to charge residents 6pm to 9pm on the seafront? Or could it have been the widely publicised scathing last remarks from former Labour councillor, Stephen George, and backed up by other now former Labour councillors about the toxic nature of the party leadership?\nThe Council Meeting\nAfter the personal attacks came the professional ones.\nThe meeting was not 3 minutes in before bedlam took over caused by Cllr Cowan’s overtly undemocratic policy proposal to change the constitution to effectively abandon proper scrutiny.\nIt is hard to describe the rapid level of descent this meeting plummeted to in such quick time. Sparing all the detail of the bewilderment, panic, farce and embarrassment, Cowan wanted to amend the constitution so any policies that were to come from himself and his Cabinet colleagues would then be Chaired and Vice Chaired by members of his own alliance in the scrutiny committees, as opposed to the current policy that sees Chairs selected from the opposition, which ensures a much fairer level of scrutiny.\nCowan said the Tories blocked policies on purpose, which is why this was proposed.\nCllr Buck said Cowan was shutting down free speech; that he wanted to be judge, juror and executioner of his own policies; and asked whether dictator should be added to Cllr George’s review!\nI wrote in a previous blog that Cowan would need to pay a premium to get a coalition on board, and my best bet would be these extra positions are part of the deal. (see: With no overall majority, Labour and Tories will be dealing their way to administration. With Confelicity’s modest increase in vote share, we now turn to the GE to spread our local message (southendconfelicityparty.co.uk))\nIf Cllr Cowan thought his victory as Leader of Southend City Council would protect him from any further onslaughts, Tory councillor Daryl Jones read out what was looking to be an honest account of one of the former Labour Councillors personal experience of the Leader. As her words were being read out, a frantic point of order was called by Cllr Lydia Hyde to protect her leader’s reputation from being further gutted on the council chamber. Granted it did not have much to do with the debate, so Cllr Jones was duly silenced.\nTo the next 2 years\nThere is a bit of me that does not envy what Cowan and Co. face over the next few years. It’s easy to criticise when it’s not your neck on the line, but he and his team are now waking up in the morning with life-changing decisions to make.\nIf they can solve the growing debt problems without affecting services that will be impressive.\nIf they can save Southend United without endangering Southend’s financial position they really will be winning.\nIf they can regenerate the high street and fill up Victoria Shopping Centre with Southend’s brightest entrepreneurs they may never be removed from power.\nIf they can end homelessness, rid our sea of sewage, fix our pot holes and pavements, empty our bins weekly, cut our grass, and stop over-development, all the while reducing council tax, rents and charges, while avoiding their previous poor decisions such as charging us to park in our parks, charging us to go to the toilet, bring in any form of LTNs, and stop building on our green spaces, we may as well end democracy as we know it and enshrine them as our Grand Leaders infinitum!\nDespite my severe reservations, I actually do wish them the best of luck because we cannot afford them to get it wrong.\nTraffic Working Regulations Party - 30th May\nThe trashing of the seafront has begun.\nUnfortunately, the coalition failed to invite a single resident of the 586 who signed the petition against the seafront 6pm to 9pm charges at the recent Traffic Working Regulations Party, and voted through the motion. Cllr Cox requested this aspect of the meeting be postponed due to no one receiving the invite, however, Cllr Cowan managed to squeeze this through in what definitely did not look like best practice. As other councillors spoke out their mics were duly turned off! What made matters even more inconceivable was they amended the budget to somehow reverse these parking charges on Eastern Esplanade where it just so happens Cllr Terry lives.\nConclude as you see fit.\nAll of this is so unpalatable and I look forward to the day when the culture changes. In the meantime, our role as Southend residents is to be on top of everything that comes out from this administration. Go to the public meetings and ask questions. Start petitions and reply to public consultations. I would urge all of us to take a keener interest in local affairs, however, if all else fails, we have a local party watching.",

I have provided my views of the motivations behind the motion and what it means in reality. Oddly, because of the situation, I have started with an attempt at empathy with the owner's position.\nThis is a highly emotive issue for the fans and one that has brought everyone together, probably more so than at any other time. So I want to make it clear that I am 100% behind Southend United and sincerely hope that this can be resolved. My views here are simply a reflection of the political dome that has captured the club.\nThe Owner\nHe has become enemy No.1 in Southend. He cannot leave his house without being subjected to harassment. He has seen his club plummet from potential Premier League side to non-league. His income streams via the club have gone. He has lost his investment. The bills are rising beyond his means. He cannot pay the players and staff. He did not want any of this to happen, in fact, he would have wanted the same as everyone else: success! His very livelihood is threatened. He is an older gentleman and would be thinking of his financial stability. Somehow he has to work out how this can work for him. This will be traumatic for him and his family. His mental well-being will be in jeopardy. He will want to get out as soon as possible with as much as he can get given the circumstances. He would negotiate the best terms for himself. He would have no loyalty to the fans as they hate him. In fact, a part of him would want to see the club go bust just to p**s them off. He is a proud man and he refuses to be forced from his business because of what he may see as a bunch of thugs and lunatics! He may rather cut his nose to spite his face.\nA person in power is different to everyone else. However small the empire, they are emperors. Some even graduate to Gods. When their people turn against them they feel betrayed and they must be taught a lesson - however bloody that may have to be.\nDoes that mean that fans are to blame? Far from it, they ARE the club. They are right! He desperately needs to heed their call. He is the only person who can save our club, everything else is just politics.\nJust Politics\nOne independent councillor initiated an amendment of the Southend Labour motion that would see the council lend £2m whilst a new owner was found. This was subsequently amended to be something a little more broad and vague. Another suggestion was to purchase Roots Hall.\nFor the few that are unaware, the owner of the club has found himself in serious financial difficulties, which has led to the club being put up for sale. These difficulties have been publicly known and the club has been on the brink of closure in one form or another for years. Years, in fact, covering Southend Labour’s four in charge.\nThis is not to say it has been caused by Southend Labour, but the obvious question is why didn’t they help before now?\nBetter late than never perhaps?\nAnd why should this point even be made when the only thing that matters is saving the club? Even if there is a possibility of Southend United being used as a political football, if it helps, so what?\nWell, the only person that can save Southend United is the owner.\nHe has had several offers that he has turned down for unknown reasons. There are complications about the ‘new’ stadium at Fossetts and Roots Hall, and the £1 sale price buying upwards of £2.5m of debt, which has proved more than problematic.\nIt is widely reported that Anna Firth MP and other political figures are trying to help, and as the Leader of the Council stated at the meeting, they are already doing everything they can behind the scenes. What that ‘everything’ is, is difficult to say, but they’ve said it!\nYet, Southend United is a private business. Why is this private business featured in a council meeting? Maybe, as noted by most who follow the story, it is because the football club is woven into the history of Southend itself and is part of our identity. It is one of the biggest community hubs in the city and its loss would be severe.\nBut why can’t the council do much to save it? It has invested in private businesses before - the Victoria Shopping Centre for example. Southend Labour also earmarked £10m on the ill-conceived Seaway development, so it is not unthinkable.\nThe problem we have is the council was £6.9m short in last year's budget and is already looking at a £14m deficit this year. As a result, there is very serious talk that many services and capital projects will be cut.\nBeing that Southend Labour set the last budget, they know just how unrealistic it is to financially contribute to Southend United, and any other help they were proposing in the motion is ultimately peripheral. They did, however, checkmate the leader of the council to support the motion knowing any other answer may risk destroying a chunk of his potential voters.\nPolitically very well played and having seen the results on social media, it has paid off for them. Only thing is, what has happened since the motion was passed? It has been a number of weeks now, so has the club been rescued? Far from it. Fans are still protesting and shouting the message louder than ever.\nUnfortunately, as much as any support for the club should be welcome, in this case, I struggle to get past the feeling that votes are up for grabs and Southend United are caught within this net. There are some councillors that are even attending protests where they did not before even attend the games!\nThere seems to be a race to hit the social media post button as soon as the latest news comes in! And to provide some self-awareness, even this article highlighting the political gain could just as easily be construed as a vote-winning exercise! I am not free of this accusation! But this motion in particular has taken it to a new level.\nThe Two Declarations\nI have seen two Southend Labour declarations before, the ‘declaration of the climate emergency’ and the ‘declaration of a cost of living crisis’.\nPost declarations, Southend Labour’s budget included charging people to park in our public parks, charging for parking 6pm to 9pm on the seafront, increasing the Southend Pass by 18%, increasing council rents, raising council tax by 5%, raising all council charges and fees by 10%, and they were even going to charge to go to the toilet; and did, as far I could tell, very little to proactively help the environment above and beyond what would have been expected.\nSo, these declarations and motions mean little in reality, and on this particular motion, that decrees that Southend Council do everything they can to save Southend United, the same is becoming true.\nTo the solutions\nWhat if Southend United simply went bust?\nBusinesses go bust all the time, doesn’t mean they can’t go on afterwards if the assets are picked up by someone who wants to carry that business on. The difference, though, is that a football club would have to start again at the bottom of the leagues (the bottom being the ninth league). Is this a price worth paying to remove the owner once and for all?\nWorse still is if it went into liquidation and the assets are sold off completely. That would literally mean no more Roots Hall and no possibility of a re-birth.\nWhat if Southend citizens raised the funds?\nWigan Athletic fans raised £500,000 when they were on the brink. Would Southend club together and put a fiver in? 120,000 people puts us at £600K - would we do it? Would we really want to pay the owner’s tax bill? Truth is this has already been tried and around £30K was raised. It seems the appetite to support the current owner is not enough.\nWhat about buying Roots Hall?\nThat doesn’t solve the tax bill issue nor the power bill. The owner still owns the club itself. The council just ends up with a stadium that is more museum than football arena. And it doesn’t save Southend United. That’s aside from there being intricate details relating to the ownership of the stadium.\nThen the Council should make the loan?\nSouthend United is actually a very good business. Big fan base paying good money. Run well, there is no reason it shouldn’t flourish. It simply has poor ownership with no money. Why Southend Council persevered with the owner in regard to the new stadium remains a mystery. But then this is the same council who believed Turnstone would produce Seaway; Swan Housing would produce Queensway; and AEW would be a suitable custodian of the Kursaal for 200 years!\nSo let’s assume the Council’s finances are in impeccable shape, would we really ply the owner with more means to keep afloat, only serving to prolong the inevitable?\nMy heart says make the loan and keep us going in anticipation for the new Aussie saviours. If we did it, I wouldn’t protest. It’s what I really want regardless of it being a decision of high risk. It is possible that it comes off and the new buyer has time to complete the acquisition.\nIf it works then the council will be rightly lauded for an historic decision that saved our club from the brink. And even if the loan didn’t save the club and we lost the money, there will be many who would accept the loss and say at least they tried.\nFinal Whistle\nThe truth is the council need to stay well away from the financial whirlpool of Southend United. We do not have the money, the owner is struggling with money, and a new owner may never agree to the current owner’s terms.\nLike all the councillors who declared their love of the club at the meeting, I am no different.\nOf course, our home club means a lot to anyone who has grown up in the town and no one could bear seeing it go. But I have more than significant reservations.\nWe are watching a tragedy in slow-motion and it is hard not to intervene.\nI wouldn’t know what to do, but I know what we mustn’t.\nRealistically and tragically, we are in the hands of one man, and that one man must make the right decision to redeem his legacy and save the club.\nAnd saving the club means to sell - now. The fans don’t need a bloody lesson, they just need their club back.",

I know of people who have been victims of these crimes and they have found it a lifelong journey to learn to live with it how best they can.\nThe other side of this is the destruction of people’s lives due to false allegations or a mis-representation of the facts.\nAs it stands, no one yet knows the truth of the matter and we must wait for the legal process to come to its own conclusion. Yet, an arrest has been made so no doubt there will be questions regarding our vetting process.\nUnlike other parties where their leaders cannot personally select members and candidates, I can and do. I am personally responsible.\nIn most cases, the first thing I do is either speak on the phone or meet with the potential new member. We chat about their values and ambitions and see whether they connect to Confelicity’s.\nIf they like the idea of local people running things and share values of kindness, compassion, integrity, freedom of speech and democracy then we agree together their new found membership.\nIt wasn’t quite the same in Michael’s case as I’d known of him for decades having attended the same schools in Southend. He had an unblemished record personally and professionally, and I was delighted that he joined us. In the two local elections he stood in he’d achieved the highest number of votes and was a popular member of Confelicity.\nTo my disappointment he left the party over a year and a half ago for personal reasons, which he did not disclose at the time, but knowing what we know now it was indeed the right thing to do.\nAlthough I have my opinions, now is not the time to express them so as not to muddy the investigation in any shape or form.\nIn truth this case has nothing to do with myself or the party, but it is perfectly acceptable for questions to be asked of us to clarify the situation - and I hope I have done this.\nMy sincere sympathies go out to all those affected and hope they receive the right support around them to get through what must be an extremely traumatic period of their lives.",

In regard to the likely changes, a Mayor of Essex is intended to be elected in 2026. Although I disagree with what is happening, as I state in my blog, I will be standing to provide the most locally-minded voice in the line-up.\nIn the meantime, I sincerely hope that you can connect with what we are trying to do and hope you can put your faith in us when or if the time comes.\nYours faithfully\nJames Miller BA (hons), MBA\nSouthend Confelicity Party Leader\nProspective Leigh Ward Candidate 2026\nProspective Mayor of Essex Candidate\nProspective Parliamentary Candidate for Southend West and Leigh\nEconomy\n\"We need to build seeds of industry to grow new business and create jobs\".\nSouthend High Street has the potential to reshape its contribution to the City. It can thrive again, we just need to address the basic fundamentals of what makes a High Street work:\n-\nWe need to bring all the landlords together to work alongside the Council and other stakeholders to agree on a singular vision.\n-\nImproving parking, cleanliness, greenery with seasonal displays, safety and the general environment is a must, but ultimately it is the shops that people come for, so all our efforts should be geared towards filling the empty retail units with reputable businesses that will be assets to the shopping experience.\n-\nIn order to fill the shops we need a way to transfer the skills and knowledge of people who have qualified in various courses at the college and university, as well as everyone else who has talent, passion and an entrepreneurial spirit across the City, directly into the units to create the most unique high street in the country.\n-\nPotential entrepreneurs need to be reassured that they actually have a chance of making it work by lowering all business costs, allowing them enough time to build a strong customer base, with a gradual incremental increase in rates overtime.\n-\nWe need to make it easy for local people to set up a business by providing expert business support who can give them the knowledge to succeed. We would raise awareness of all available start-up support.\n-\nWe will bring back indoor/outdoor markets to act as the hub of local entrepreneurship whilst providing a unique shopping experience in Southend High Street.\n-\nWe recognise that national brands are vital to any high street and we should continue to do everything to attract them with favourable rates. Unfortunately they have found online a far more cost-effective and efficient way of operating so this will be a challenge. It is time to do it ourselves.\nImagine a High Street full of shops selling unique products and services run by local owner/operators, making a living doing what they love – just like it used to be!\nWe would embark on a journey of planting seeds of industry and enterprise, looking at suitable brownfield sites to develop professional infrastructure for both online and offline businesses, where in years to come we can start to see quality career opportunities in engineering, tech, arts, fashion, film, music, catering, and so on, here in Southend.\nWe will look to explore ways in which to re-open the redundant ‘Beach Club’ Southend Activity Marine Centre. Southend should be built on the water, yet most residents have never had the opportunity to sail. We would work with community leaders who are seeking funding to make it into a viable social enterprise.\nSouthend Pier is world famous, but could be so much more. We will put out a public consultation to residents for their ideas what they would like to see at the end of the Pier. We believe it should be the Eiffel Tower of the UK and should be met with the same ambition as the people that first imagined it in the first place.\nWe will reduce the price of The Pier for local people.\nWe will oppose the £10m of reserve money to be ‘invested’ in Seaway, a project that Turnstone – the developers themselves – are now unwilling to invest in.\nThe Kursaal require immediate and effective solutions as soon as possible. However, to avoid such failings in the future we would introduce break-clauses in contracts for sites that are deemed important to the City.\nWe will make taxation transparent for the public in a format that is easily accessible, understandable and where justification for expenditure can be made.\nWe would be in favour of any future expansion of London Southend City airport. However, residents must be consulted every step of the way.\nWe will introduce a new city-wide discount card for Southend residents.\nWe do not feel that dividing the city into 8 districts, with fines of £35 to £70 for driving through each one, is the correct way to manage traffic flow within the city of Southend.\nWe support the use of cash and card as a method of payment for council services.\nWe support a review of the Executive team’s remuneration with a view to reduce or freeze their pay. A 10% cut would save £200K and would enable dementia services to continue as they are. It would also act as a symbolic move that may restore faith back into our leadership.\nWe pledge to support implementing voluntary remuneration reviews for all staff above £50K. A 10% cut, for example, would save vast sums that may help to keep the libraries open.\nWe support reducing the remuneration packages of all new council employees once the post has been left vacant.\nWe will return the councillor position to a voluntary role, which would save almost £1m.\nWe support publishing a full and detailed account of all council expenditure. Currently items under £500 are not published and details are vague and indeterminable.\nWe would support a City of Culture bid.\nWe will re-evaluate the partners SBC have chosen to work with.\nWe will support and facilitate a new ‘Southend Innovation’ hub that seeks to leverage the infrastructure that is already in place; bring new investment into the city; and provide quality new jobs in for residents of Southend and the local area.\nWe support opening up fair competition in Southend’s taxi market.\nWe oppose the type of devolution and local government reorganisation that will see Southend swallowed up in a new super council of Rochford, Castle Point and Southend that will look after almost 400,000 residents.\nEnvironment\n\"We need to protect our waters and green spaces\".\nSouthend’s sea is one of our most precious assets, and yet during off-peak months water and sewage companies are allowed to pump sewage discharges from storm overflows. Would would seek regulation to make this illegal.\nWe would seek to protect all of our remaining green spaces and greenbelt from anymore development. This would include the land by Bournes green Chase.\nWe would support a communications drive to educate and encourage Southend citizens and businesses to re-cycle their waste, with an ambitious but very achievable aim to rapidly increase re-cycle rates from 45% to 90% by the end of 2027.\nWe will re-introduce permissions to allow barbecues on the beach, but with a set of guidelines that may include all or some of the following: permitted after 6pm; only re-useable BBQs allowed; must be raised above the stones; cold water must be poured over when finished; and disposal on coals in a yellow basket provided when finished.\nWe are against the taxation of older vehicles. We believe in striving for clean air in Southend, but we do not believe in penalising those that can least afford it.\nWe are against the installation of 5G masts in residential areas.\nWe are against turning Southend into a SMART City.\nWe are against future developments on flood plains, such as the Bellway development in Shoebury\nWe support the requirement of any contracts for developers to include a clause to include: ‘if you break, pay for it’.\nWhere Southend Council holds a direct interest in a development (e.g. The Kursaal), we support a set percentage of the development to be completed, reviewed case-by-case, in a specified period of time. We would also ensure all developers are required to have secured 100% of the funding.\nWe will oppose tree-felling where it is possible to do so.\nWe support dogs to be allowed on designated sections of the beach at specified times, outside peak times of the day, all year round.\nHealth & Well-being\n\"We need to bring back civic pride\".\nWe will introduce the ‘Southend Civic Pride Volunteering Partnership’ that would bring together people who wish to bring their talents wherever the need is greatest.\nWe believe that we can do it ourselves, which means serving each other above and beyond the funds of the council.\nWe want to link those people that are willing to give up their time to help others with those that are in need of that help through a shared skills community website and app. For example, a student who needs help with maths can put in their request and match with a Southend resident willing to teach them for free.\nThe basis of this scheme would not be to encroach on otherwise paid positions, rather fill the gaps that would never be able to be filled. We would look to utilise the skills, talent, knowledge and experience of newly qualified young people; retired seniors with still so much to give; as well as those that still work and who can spare a few hours of their expertise. Our end goal would be for every resident to volunteer one hour a week to surpass a million hours a year. Just think what Southend may look like with those extra resources!\nWe would look to re-establish a sense of civic pride by:\n-\nImproving the general environment and the management of street signage, park fences, pavements, litter and debris.\n-\nPromoting local history and telling the great stories of local people that could inspire all generations. We would display our history across the city in celebration of our greatest people through art, architecture, monuments and literature.\n-\nWe would celebrate our culture with annual festivals and award ceremonies.\n-\nWe would bring to the fore aspirational figures such as outstanding nurses, doctors, teachers, police officers, fire fighters, care workers, musicians, sport people, builders, entrepreneurs, volunteers, and architects across the City.\n-\nWe would pro-actively support, encourage and promote Southend sports teams, such as Southend United, in a way that would foster a greater sense of community for all the People of Southend.\n-\nRe-introduce school children visiting the Civic Centre, view Southend Council meetings and meet Councillors, and teach them how the political system works so they can take an active interest.\n-\nWe would invest in our Youth Outreach Programme\nWe would significantly increase the number of bike racks across the city where cyclists could feel confident their bikes are safe.\nWe would invest in outdoor gyms in all parks, where suitable to improve health and well-being.\nWe will support bringing back the iconic seafront illuminations. These were an attraction in themselves and would enhance the experience for residence and visitors\nWe will not introduce parking charges in our parks.\nWe will uphold the legal obligations and human rights for residents who are classified with special education needs and disabilities.\nWe would support local employers in becoming qualified in mental health first aid.\nWe will support the continuation of the Leigh Community Centre.\nWe will reinstate all 12 Dementia Navigators positions.\nWe will reinstate the family centre in St Luke’s.\nWe will keep all the libraries that are in Southend open, ensuring they are evolving and being modernised.\n*The Dementia Navigators and family centre would be paid for by reducing the budget amendment reduction of high street parking from 11% to the required figure e.g. 2% to 5%.\nWe will investigate where adult and child social care funds are going, cut waste, and push for improved services.\nWe support a youth councillor being elected from every senior school in Southend.\nProtection\n\"We need to bring back bobbies on the beat\".\nWe will support bringing back ‘bobbies on the beat’, who would walk the same areas and get to know residents by name.\nWe will support a satellite police station in Southend High Street.\nWe will re-ignite the Special Constabulary scheme. It is a much under-publicised role that allows people to volunteer 16 hours of their time per month, where they are trained and have the same powers as regular Police Officers.\nWe will re-start the Community Safety scheme where employers can fund select members of their workforce to join the wider police community.\nWe will ban electric scooters on public pavements. We would also educate and inform residents of the legalities of electric scooters.\nWe will look to re-open youth centres across Southend in order to reduce crime and provide a safe space where young people can occupy their time in an enjoyable and productive way, broaden their education, and gain easy access to mental health services.\nWe will invest in extra security cameras and police resources in known crime hotspots for anti-social behaviour.\nWhilst the detail of drive away fines remains unclear and insufficiently communicated the policy should be put on hold.\nWe will support the continuation of car cruises on Southend seafront by taking a light-touch approach that balances enjoyment with responsibility. By working closely with cruise organisers and community leaders, we will ensure these events remain low-impact, safe, and a positive part of Southend’s identity.\nHousing\n\"We need to ensure our infrastructure and services can sustain new developments\".\nWe would work in partnership with Southend Homeless Action Network (SHAN) to put in place long-term strategies to end homelessness.\nWe believe in the development of Queensway, but we will look to re-start the process with a more financially viable scheme.\nWe support the enforcement of the affordable housing quota on property developers.\nIt is accepted that planning applications have to be considered on their own merits, however, we would pursue planning and regulation that whenever a new development is being considered, provision of the necessary infrastructure must be included as part of it.\nTransport, Roads, Pavements and Parking\n\"We will bring in parking charges that support residents, business and visitors\".\nFor any future plans regarding Queensway, we will be against filling in the road as it will create gridlock and cut off the businesses on Southchurch Road and Sutton Road.\nWe will oppose charging for parking along the entire seafront from 6pm onwards.\nWe would introduce 1-hour free parking, similar to Leigh, around Southend High Street.\nWe are against closing car parks if it results in visitors causing congestion in residential parking nearby.\nWe would oppose the introduction of cashless-only parking meters, and ensure they are all able to take both cash and card.\nWe would launch a review of the cycle lanes on the seafront to enhance their safety.\nWe would support fixing potholes across the City.\nWe would support speed cameras in identified speeding hotspots in order to prevent accidents before they happen.\nWe would support speed reductions in certain areas including 20 miles per hour zones – but only if residents from each road have collectively agreed.\nWe are against pavements constantly being dug up by different companies carrying out works, then left looking in a poor state. Therefore, we would add a clause into the contracts for all companies who wish to work on our pavements to ensure all works are finished to a high quality that does not negatively impact the look of the area.\nWe are against the disruption caused by multiple road closures at the same time due to infrastructure works, and will examine the current planning process with the objective of encouraging better coordination, including work that is carried out during the night.\nWe will continue to campaign against the closures of ticket offices at train stations should the need arise.\nWe would expand parking for motorcycles.\nWe will look at how the shared space along ‘City Beach’ and the High Street can be made safer for both pedestrians and cyclists.\nClick here to see all member's voting records.",

A question for the ages!\n- James Miller\n- Nov 12, 2024\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Dec 14, 2024\nI feel certain Trump’s omission of Southend-on-Sea in any of his speeches thus far was not meant as a slight. Our time will come and I’m sure our patience will be rewarded with a shout out alongside our seaside friends in Clacton who look to have donated their local MP pro bono to Trump’s cause.\nWhilst we are waiting I thought I might put in my tuppence-worth of commentary to somehow connect the President Elect’s triumph to what it means for us in our quiet little corner of the world.\nTrump Manifesto (or ‘Agenda 27)\nHaving breezed through his base plan that some may argue is juvenile, unworkable, impractical and immoral (judge for yourselves at: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform),\nI have loosely managed to find a few things that may be of interest for us in Southend.\nI must also make a general observation that there is just a bit more than a passing resemblance to Reform’s ‘contract’ with all their ambitions of aggressive military investment, ‘peace through strength’ nationalist rhetoric, transphobia and racial targeting.\nWar and peace\nFirst bit of good news is his manifesto/Agenda will not see the world burn.\nIn his words, he wants to ‘Stop World War Three’ and what is more important than peace?\nSome of our daily rags were regularly running stories about the necessity of a return to national service in the UK to which I found abhorrent. If Trump is successful in his claim to stop the Wars in 24 hours then he may well have saved the lives of tens of thousands of Southends’ most eligible military recruits - as well as millions more across the world.\nAll other world leaders powerful enough to have had influence on the fighting have failed to bring an end to the bloodshed, and though Trump’s conduct may well be an anathema to many, all ought to be forgiven if he manages to achieve this seemingly impossible task.\nEconomy\nThe economy is his bread and butter. He understands capitalism inside out and knows what to do to create a great business environment: regulation that is fair rather than punitive; wages that are affordable to grow business and that do not fuel excessive inflation; a tax system that encourages business to expand rather than draining them of investment capital every time they make a profit.\nMy only confusion is that he wants to make ‘large tax cuts for workers’ and at the same time ‘end inflation’. Whilst I agree with tax cuts for low income households it is inevitable that will cause some level of inflation all things being equal.\nAside from that small contradiction, a successful US economy will mean more opportunities for the UK to grow our economy and somehow the trickle-down may make it all the way down to us. Perhaps we might be able to afford having our bins emptied more than twice a month or turning the street lights back on!\nImmigration\nTrump’s hardline immigration policy that will ‘stop the migrant invasion’ and see the ‘largest deportation in history’ may mean those millions of people hoping for the American Dream may have to settle for the UK’s open arms and unprotected borders.\nSouthend residents already know we are over-populated with our public services and infrastructure inadequate as a result, but with ever more people perhaps arriving it may be expected more shiny new tower blocks will be on the way and with it more green land lost.\nThis may serve to compound Labour’s declaration to build houses almost anywhere and everywhere by magically turning green belt into grey belt land and speed up Southend’s transition into a concrete city. Hadleigh Farmland is a horrifying example just next door.\nWoke!\nTrump will reverse the woke agenda that many feel has gone too far. Respect for our fellow human is right, but there are those whose patience has been stretched. The manner in which this reversal will take place will be overt and aggressive and could easily slingshot past what could be considered a fair and reasonable re-balance.\nAs said, Reform UK are distinctly linked with Trump and the similarities in their social views are clear. For Southend, we have two newly turned Reform UK councillors already and I have no doubt they will look to field candidates for all 51 seats in the local elections in 2026 if they can. If Trump manages to change the social rights and wrongs in the US and the UK is impressed, I can see a wave of momentum over here which could see the face of our council change and its philosophy with it.\nNew Era\nWhenever a new political leader or party takes over - regardless of who and what it is they represent - I always have hope in the first few days. Fresh start, new eyes and all that.\nFor instance, even though I was worried about national Labour’s coming to power, I was still hopeful their election victory would launch the UK to a brighter future. As it is they are on course to destroy the economy, greenbelt land and the lives of millions of pensioners, as well as taxing us to death. Southend Labour will always act consistent to their national colleagues and we will see our council tax and all fees and charges go up yet again while basic services will be cut.\nMy hope of Labour being our saviour disappeared within weeks, but despite everything telling me otherwise, I sincerely hope Trump will be successful in making the world a better place (what the hell…great again!), and wish him the best of luck from all of us in Southend.",

The main advantage of them running as Confelicity is that voters will know what they will get.\nIndependents Versus Party Candidates\nAll candidates are to be congratulated for putting themselves forward to serve the residents of Leigh.\nLeaving yourself open to criticism and potential character assassinations are just two of the many tricky issues to navigate, and so the question is, why do it?\nFor the career politician the answer is obvious. They want to rise up within their chosen parties for the benefit, primarily, of themselves.\nFor those of us who have been around long enough, they can be easily identified. Their decisions are inconsistent across a period of time with very spurious reasons for any sharp change of mind. When the party whips make their stand, this is always the true test and one may only look at the Winter Fuel Payments as a recent example.\nThe concept of whips is really a method of dictatorship within our democratic system. It comes with many threats of disciplinary action if a politician follows their conscience, which is why politicians are cornered into making such obviously ridiculous excuses when manoeuvring around a policy they know is ill-thought out.\nNone of this is to say they don’t care and that they actually do want to do good for the people, but their primary job is to serve themselves and the party.\nThe career politician just needs to sound convincing; convince people to fund them; if lucky enough to win an election, vote as blindly instructed by their party; and then sell that instruction as plausibly as they can to the public.\nAll of this is why I have profound empathy with the founders of LTC wanting to do away with party politics and bestow the town with independent people who are only there for the good of the residents.\nPresumably, they believed that being independent in of itself would make LTC independent, and whilst I agree with the sentiment there are several arguments to say it is not quite as straightforward.\nIs independence, independent?\nThe idea that a member of a political party stands as an ‘independent’ candidate and leaves politics at the door is an interesting notion.\nThere is no escape from their political ties, but I don’t see anything wrong with it. Why wouldn’t we want to know as much as possible about the candidate we are about to vote for? I have already noted many comments on the socials on Looking After Leigh and Leigh on Sea Politics for Residents from people who say they know nothing about the independent candidates.\nAnyone who joins a party does so because they fundamentally agree with its values and vision and wish to see the practical application of its philosophy.\nConfelicity has a constitution and manifesto that all can see. There we are for all our warts to be seen, analysed and either tossed aside or lauded.\nReform UK have also thrown their hat in the ring and the same is true of them. They want to see this country turned into some kind of military-led police state with a propensity to eradicate a particular religion. I can’t see where that fits into a parish council, but at least residents know what they would be getting!\nMany residents are now familiar with the Conservative councillors on Leigh Town Council, so what difference would it make if they were all to stand as independents at the next election? Would that suddenly make them independent?\nOf course not.\nIf they were re-elected (loose term) they would run the council with the same Conservative values driving their decision-making.\nCan a Party be Independent?\nIt’s a leading question because by some convenient coincidence of myself writing this blog, Confelicity is exactly that!\nWe wanted to dilute as much power from the Leader as possible, and one of those methods was to introduce the power of veto for every member. As a result, each member must vote unanimously for anything to become policy. Where we do not agree members are free to voice and vote as they wish, which makes them in the very truest sense, independent.\nIf our candidates were successful at the upcoming by-elections they would have complete independence over how they vote and no one from the party could change that.\nIn this sense, I believe we would be honouring the founders’ aspirations for an independently run Leigh Town Council.\nFor those interested in a whistle-stop tour of Confelicity please read the below.\nOtherwise, I wish the very best of luck to all candidates and hope those who are successful are able to continue the good work for the good of Leigh.\nAbout Confelicity\nOur Candidates\nJane Wilkes is Head of Politics in a local school and has lived and worked in Leigh for 24 years. She lives in the Highlands ward and knows exactly what is needed.\nTo read her biography:\nTris Bembridge is outspoken, loves to challenge, and whose heart is Southend through and through.\nHaving grown up in Leigh he knows the place inside out, and the same is true of the Southend political scene - there are very few stones he hasn’t turned!\nRegistered blind, he continues to show a fighting spirit that is needed in any leadership capacity.\nTo read his biography:\nThe name\nConfelicity (the word) means ‘happiness in other peoples’ happiness’. As a party, Confelicity is the local party for the national stage. Ideally, all councils across the country would have far more power and resources to take their areas forward.\nThe Local party\nWe believe that the London HQs of the main parties do not know what Southend needs, and they all take their orders from there. No amount of focus groups could ever know what we do by walking out or front doors every day!\nUndivided Democracy\nWe believe in true democracy. Our voting system requires that every member votes unanimously for a policy to make the manifesto. However, whilst a policy is undecided, we also believe in respectful freedom of speech, and where the party has not taken a position, members are free to express themselves as they wish within legal boundaries.\nValues\nWe believe that our values of compassion, empathy, understanding, kindness, humility and respectful freedom of speech should be the foundation of our decision making, and we must try to act accordingly.\nPublic Services and Business\nWe believe in building great public services, but this must be paid for by a thriving private sector. For this reason, we must make doing business easy.\nWhere we are now\nWe have been going for around 2 and a half years and have been in 3 local elections and the recent General Election.\nOur support locally has grown over each election, albeit small, and we continue to grow. Membership is free and all Southend residents are welcome to voice and vote at our manifesto meetings.\nThe biggest myth is that we are the Peter Pans Party!\nUnderstandably, there are some who think the place you work and parents you’re born to reflect one’s politics and outside interests. Our members, who live across Southend and work in various places in various industries would attest to this not being the case.\nAs time goes on this will inevitably subside as people begin to realise that we are just a humble set of passionate Southend residents who want to see the place where we live and work do well.\nPolicies\nGreenbelt and Infrastructure\nWe must stop building on greenbelt land and green spaces. We do not want to live in a city of concrete and the effect on the environment will never be restored.\nOur infrastructure can’t cope and we are being asked by the new Labour government to accommodate even more people upon our creaking public services.\nIn keeping with our pro-local stance, the power of parish councils cannot be underestimated. They do have advisory powers over planning and depending on who is the voice of the council, it could be made very loudly indeed. Nothing is to stop LTC drawing naked attention to any particular planning application and galvanising residents into pushing back.\nThe current backlash against the Salvation Army’s plans to build 2,500 homes in Castle Point is a case in point. We, of course, will be right behind that in any capacity we can.\nParking\nThe parking issues we cannot solve alone and I’m sure many have tried! All we can say is we will listen to all suggestions and go from there. Unless we find and fund another car park somewhere there may not be a lot that can be done.\nConduct\nIn terms of our conduct on the council, we will be open, honest, challenging and competent. We will listen and take on board what is being said. We will work in partnership with residents and attempt, at least, to resolve any particular disagreements. As said, compassion, empathy, understanding and kindness underpin our party and whilst there may be moments we don’t live up to that, doesn’t mean we won’t aspire to it.\nPublic office, however far down some might perceive that office to be, is a thankless task. There is a minimum expectation that if met receives few fan mails. As soon as it is wrong, then off we go. It is the nature of the beast and I admire anyone that wishes to put themselves in front of people to do good.\nThat being said, if there are mishaps, those same people must be held to account. This, unfortunately, is often what is missing. We will hold our hands up if we’re wrong, and we will fall on our swords. If we’re not good enough right now, any pride we may have will be overridden by our civic duty to do what’s best for the town.",

This means if you are passionate about any particular subject that has not yet been voted on, you could join, raise the motion, and become an integral part of shaping that policy.\nWe are proud of our manifesto, which seeks to bring Southend together. It will be costed by a mixture of public and private funding, as we work in partnership with stakeholders from across the city.\nConfelicity Explained\nAs a new party I have taken the liberty to explain what we are all about. Firstly, the name! We were going to be called the Southend Party, but stumbled upon Confelicity after discovering it meant 'joy in other's happiness, which we felt was apt for what we are trying to achieve.\nThe vision of Confelicity is to create an environment where all of us can feel happy in our lives with feel a deep sense of meaning and purpose for the future, on the path to fulfilling our potential for the betterment of ourselves and Southend.\nFor too long there has been confusion about the true aspirations of all the parties, but we ought to know exactly where we are going long-term. For this reason, we believe in the principle of idealism, which is basically visualising the most ambitious future in all areas of the political arena and working backwards from there.\nThe harder part is the how?\nWhilst espousing wild dreams of how we want our city and country to be, we fully acknowledge this isn’t realistic politics! For this reason we believe in the overtly pretentious term pragmatism, as we accept and work against the practicalities and realities of life. So many different agendas are at play such as financial, moral, religious and philosophical differences, as well as party dogmas and bureaucracies that can and do prevent progress. And more than anything else: money, power and resources.\nIn regard to power and resources, we believe in Localism. We believe those that walk the pavements should have the power to fix them! Over the course of history, power has become centralised in London within a small group of people. The question is why would any of them care about Southend? We care because we live here. If Southend Hospital is overwhelmed it is us who suffer - not them. For far too long our politicians can only pay lip service to our issues and apologise. Do you really believe any of the parliamentary candidates from the national parties are able to do any of what they speak about? They, themselves, would have had zero say in their manifestos and are fed lines from Party HQ. We believe it is time for Southend people to be represented by those who themselves are affected by the decisions that they take.\nWe believe in Undivided Democracy where democracy recognises differences, but does not divide. This means if only one member does not vote on a policy, the Party are instructed to deconstruct the individual’s reasoning to a point where agreement can be found. If agreement cannot be found the policy will never pass under Confelicity. Too many times division is caused by polarised arguments that democracy itself contributes to, causing alienation, isolation and indignation for those individuals that are on the wrong of the vote. Only by working together in partnership can the crux of the difference be found as opposed to the sharp edge of the democratic vote. We therefore believe in freedom of speech, debate and discussion in order to reach a conclusion that has been made in partnership and a spirit of unity. We believe in a collaborative approach where conflicting parties can either find common ground together, or in cases where this has not been achieved, the subject is put to one side whilst further research can be carried out. This collaborative approach relies on each subject matter being explored, interrogated, and scrutinised with rigour and a level of critique that should include information on funding, agendas and affiliations. On the conditions Confelicity values are upheld, in the meantime, members are free to express themselves on any issue as they see fit.\nWe believe in a leadership philosophy that acts as a partner, facilitator and collaborator. We believe that any rule or law that is agreed by Confelicity must be followed by the Leader and all Party members. We intend to set the leadership standard as high as possible and reject hypocrisy and cronyism. We find any kind of government corruption abhorrent and will enact a zero tolerance on any behaviours that do not coincide with these standards in or outside the party. We believe that power needs a system of checking, challenging, scrutiny, rigour and total transparency and should be diluted as much as possible to fend against those that do misuse their power. Hence the voting structure of our Party empowers all members with the power of veto.\nWhich ties into our last point: our culture. When you come off a conversation with us we hope you will be able to feel our sense of empathy, kindness and humility. That you were able to enjoy the conversation in an atmosphere of respectful free speech without judgment as we showed patience, tolerance and forgiveness where necessary. (For too long, those who might consider themselves good people have felt compelled to admonish others as the self-proclaimed arbiters of moral judgment!). And you trust us because we are open and honest in our answers.\nPolitics is in desperate need of authentic change and we believe we can be that for Southend.\nI sincerely hope that you can connect with what we are trying to do and hope you can put your faith in us when the time comes.\nYours faithfully\nJames Miller BA (hons), MBA\nSouthend Confelicity Party Leader\nParliamentary Candidate for Southend West and Leigh\nEconomy\n\"We need to build seeds of industry to grow new business and create jobs\".\nWe live in a capitalist society, which relies on people taking resources and transforming them into something profitable. Through this jobs are created and real wealth is put in people’s hands which can be spent in other businesses creating more. Every party works within this economic model and we are no different. If the goal is to create wealth so we can all enjoy a good life then it is government’s mission to ensure the business environment is encouraged.\nWhilst inward investment is always required from well-established organisations, our intention is to create full employment by creating the most fertile SME business environment possible for entrepreneurship to flourish. This includes lowering the risk of business failure by helping to reduce costs, and creating a business infrastructure and entrepreneurial culture that would encourage as many people to use their talents and start their own businesses.\nWe believe the tax system should incentivise councils to grow business and therefore should be rewarded for facilitating a thriving economy by growing alongside the business success they help create, instead of relying on counter-productive tax policies.\nWe encourage people to become as wealthy as their business or job enables them to be, however, we recognise that the resources used to generate their income would, in many cases, deprive other citizens of their use i.e. land, materials, people, etc. Therefore, it is expected that citizens will be recompensed accordingly through the tax system to a level that both continues to encourage re-investment of the business and supply the necessary investment into public services we all want.\nWe acknowledge that the cost of living is a fundamental barrier to the prospects of individual wealth and prosperity, and we would seek to redress the balance by supporting those industries that are fundamental to national infrastructure back into public hands in order to cap bills to an affordable level for all.\n1\nSouthend High Street has the potential to reshape its contribution to the City. It can thrive again, we just need to address the basic fundamentals of what makes a High Street work:\n-\nWe need to bring all the landlords together to work alongside the Council and other stakeholders to agree on a singular vision.\n-\nImproving parking, cleanliness, greenery with seasonal displays, safety and the general environment is a must, but ultimately it is the shops that people come for, so all our efforts should be geared towards filling the empty retail units with reputable businesses that will be assets to the shopping experience.\n-\nIn order to fill the shops we need a way to transfer the skills and knowledge of people who have qualified in various courses at the college and university, as well as everyone else who has talent, passion and an entrepreneurial spirit across the City, directly into the units to create the most unique high street in the country.\n-\nPotential entrepreneurs need to be reassured that they actually have a chance of making it work by lowering all business costs, allowing them enough time to build a strong customer base, with a gradual incremental increase in rates overtime.\n-\nWe need to make it easy for local people to set up a business by providing expert business support who can give them the knowledge to succeed. We would raise awareness of all available start-up support.\n-\nWe will bring back indoor/outdoor markets to act as the hub of local entrepreneurship whilst providing a unique shopping experience in Southend High Street.\n-\nWe recognise that national brands are vital to any high street and we should continue to do everything to attract them with favourable rates. Unfortunately they have found online a far more cost-effective and efficient way of operating so this will be a challenge. It is time to do it ourselves.\nImagine a High Street full of shops selling unique products and services run by local owner/operators, making a living doing what they love – just like it used to be!\n2\nWe will seek to create a meaningful and practical connection between education and careers in Southend, and ultimately create work opportunities where people can make a living doing what they love.\nWe would embark on a journey of planting seeds of industry and enterprise, looking at suitable brownfield sites to develop professional infrastructure for both online and offline businesses, where in years to come we can start to see quality career opportunities in engineering, tech, arts, fashion, film, music, catering, and so on, here in Southend.\n3\nWe will re-open the redundant ‘Beach Club’ Southend Activity Marine Centre. Southend should be built on the water, yet most residents have never had the opportunity to sail. We would work with community leaders who are seeking funding to make it into a viable social enterprise.\n4\nSouthend Pier is world famous, but could be so much more. We will put out a public consultation to residents for their ideas what they would like to see at the end of the Pier. We believe it should be the Eiffel Tower of the UK and should be met with the same ambition as the people that first imagined it in the first place.\n5\nWe will reduce the price of The Pier for local people.\n6\nWe will oppose the £10m of reserve money to be ‘invested’ in Seaway, a project that Turnstone – the developers themselves – are now unwilling to invest in.\n7\nThe Kursaal require immediate and effective solutions as soon as possible. However, to avoid such failings in the future we would introduce break-clauses in contracts for sites that are deemed important to the City.\n8\nWe recognise that tax payer’s money is just that: it does not belong to a political party or a politician. Tax belongs to each person that has contributed into paying into the collective pot, and should be respected as such. We recognise that public waste is deeply off-putting for people to want to pay more tax, and so we would look to make taxation transparent for the public in a format that is easily accessible, understandable and where justification for expenditure can be made.\n9\nWe would be in favour of any future expansion of London Southend City airport. However, residents must be consulted every step of the way.\n10\nWe will introduce a new city-wide discount card for Southend residents.\n11\nWe will oppose increases in council fees and charges.\n12\nWe do not feel that dividing the city into 8 districts, with fines of £35 to £70 for driving through each one, is the correct way to manage traffic flow within the city of Southend.\n13\nWe support the use of cash and card as a method of payment.\n14\nWe support the devolution of powers from central government to a new 'Combined Authority' of Essex, Thurrock and Southend, depending on the detail of the deal, which would include Southend retaining all of its current powers.\n15\nWe support a review of the Executive team’s remuneration with a view to reduce or freeze their pay. A 10% cut would save £200K and would enable dementia services to continue as they are. It would also act as a symbolic move that may restore faith back into our leadership.\n16\nWe pledge to support implementing voluntary remuneration reviews for all staff above £50K. A 10% cut, for example, would save vast sums that may help to keep the libraries open.\n17\nWe support reducing the remuneration packages of all new council employees once the post has been left vacant.\n18\nWe would support a City of Culture bid.\n19\nWe will re-evaluate the partners SBC have chosen to work with.\n20\nWe will support and facilitate a new ‘Southend Innovation’ hub that seeks to leverage the infrastructure that is already in place; bring new investment into the city; and provide quality new jobs in for residents of Southend and the local area.\nCouncils need to be financially rewarded for growing local business, jobs and wealth, and we would do this by advocating for them to keep 100% of business rates. We would also empower them to reduce business rates for start-ups.\nWe would aim to reduce VAT according to what is affordable.\nWe would increase the personal allowance to £18K.\nEnvironment\n\"We need to protect our waters and green spaces\".\nWe believe that a sustainable environment must form the foundation of all decision-making, and we seek to create a clean environment, clean air and clean waters.\n21\nSouthend’s sea is one of our most precious assets, and yet during off-peak months water and sewage companies are allowed to pump sewage discharges from storm overflows. Would would seek regulation to make this illegal. Ideally, Southend needs a whole new sewage system that is fit for purpose.\nWe would also seek to protect all of our remaining green spaces from anymore development.\n22\nWe would support a communications drive to educate and encourage Southend citizens and businesses to re-cycle their waste, with an ambitious but very achievable aim to rapidly increase re-cycle rates from 45% to 90% by the end of 2025.\n23\nWe will re-introduce permissions to allow barbecues on the beach, but with a set of guidelines that may include all or some of the following: permitted after 6pm; only re-useable BBQs allowed; must be raised above the stones; cold water must be poured over when finished; and disposal on coals in a yellow basket provided when finished.\n24\nWe are against the taxation of older vehicles. We believe in striving for clean air in Southend, but we do not believe in penalising those that can least afford it.\n25\nWe are against the installation of 5G masts in residential areas.\n26\nWe are against future developments on flood plains.\n27\nWe support the requirement of any contracts for developers to include a clause to include: ‘if you break, pay for it’.\n28\nWhere Southend holds a direct interest in a development (e.g. The Kursaal), we support a set percentage of the development to be completed, reviewed case-by-case, in a specified period of time. We would also ensure all developers are required to have secured 100% of the funding.\n29\nWe will oppose tree-felling where it is possible to do so.\n30\nWe support dogs to be allowed on designated sections of the beach at specified times, outside peak times of the day, all year round.\nHealth & Well-being\n\"We need to bring back civic pride\".\nWe believe we are all entitled to live long and healthy lives through free access to health and social care.\nThe ultimate aim is for zero waiting times for quality diagnosis and treatment whilst doing everything possible to prevent the issues in the first place. For this we would need to quadruple capacity in Southend Hospital and our GP surgeries, which at this time is unrealistic given that today’s challenge is merely to keep the services we already have. As a party that is only made up of Southend residents, we stand the most to gain by fighting for an expansion of our capacity, which is what we would intend to do.\n31\nWe will introduce the ‘Southend Civic Pride Volunteering Partnership’ that would bring together people who wish to bring their talents wherever the need is greatest.\nWe believe that we can do it ourselves, which means serving each other above and beyond the funds of the council.\nWe want to link those people that are willing to give up their time to help others with those that are in need of that help through a shared skills community website and app. For example, a student who needs help with maths can put in their request and match with a Southend resident willing to teach them for free.\nThe basis of this scheme would not be to encroach on otherwise paid positions, rather fill the gaps that would never be able to be filled. We would look to utilise the skills, talent, knowledge and experience of newly qualified young people; retired seniors with still so much to give; as well as those that still work and who can spare a few hours of their expertise. Our end goal would be for every resident to volunteer one hour a week to surpass a million hours a year. Just think what Southend may look like with those extra resources!\nWe would look to re-establish a sense of civic pride by:\n-\nImproving the general environment and the management of street signage, park fences, pavements, litter and debris.\n-\nPromoting local history and telling the great stories of local people that could inspire all generations. We would display our history across the city in celebration of our greatest people through art, architecture, monuments and literature.\n-\nWe would celebrate our culture with annual festivals and award ceremonies.\n-\nWe would bring to the fore aspirational figures such as outstanding nurses, doctors, teachers, police officers, fire fighters, care workers, musicians, sport people, builders, entrepreneurs, volunteers, and architects across the City.\n-\nWe would pro-actively support, encourage and promote Southend sports teams, such as Southend United, in a way that would foster a greater sense of community for all the People of Southend.\n-\nRe-introduce school children visiting the Civic Centre, view Southend Council meetings and meet Councillors, and teach them how the political system works so they can take an active interest.\n32\nWe will re-build the Southend Cricket Pavilion.\n33\nWe would significantly increase the number of bike racks across the city where cyclists could feel confident their bikes are safe.\n34\nWe would invest in outdoor gyms in all parks, where suitable to improve health and well-being.\n35\nWe will support bringing back the iconic seafront illuminations. These were an attraction in themselves and would enhance the experience for residence and visitors\n36\nWe will not introduce parking charges in our parks.\n37\nWe will uphold the legal obligations and human rights for residents who are classified with special education needs and disabilities.\n38\nWe would support local employers in becoming qualified in mental health first aid.\n39\nWe will support the continuation of the Leigh Community Centre.\n40\nWe will retain all 12 Dementia Navigators positions.\n41\nWe will retain the family centre in St Luke’s.\n42\nWe will keep all the libraries that are in Southend open, ensuring they are evolving and being modernised.\n*The Dementia Navigators and family centre would be paid for by reducing the budget amendment reduction of high street parking from 11% to the required figure e.g. 2% to 5%.\nWe would retain the triple lock.\nProtection\n\"We need to bring back bobbies on the beat\".\nIdeally, would deploy the right number of police where needed, whilst doing everything possible to reduce criminal activity in the first place. In reality, the money is unavailable, so we must turn to the voluntary schemes exist already. This really is a case of going out to Southend and asking for a hundred people that would like to be fully trained in the police to protect their fellow citizens.\nWe know where the hotspots are and a constant presence of the same set of ‘bobbies on the beat’ would change thousands of residents’ lives overnight.\nWe believe those who break the law ought to face the necessary consequences, however, we would look to create a prison system that seeks to rehabilitate, change mind-sets, and offer job opportunities in order to reduce re-offending. Re-opening youth clubs would be a good start.\nWe believe in ending the era of unnecessary surveillance under the pretext of protection.\nWe believe that helping other countries in diplomacy and bridging differences, rather than supporting and contributing to the escalation of war, will reduce the likelihood of acts of revenge on the UK. Our sympathy extends to all innocent victims in all wars across the world, and we would back any UK leadership that focuses on bringing peace. It should go without saying that the criminals who have broken international law should be found, arrested and tried in a court of law.\n43\nWe will support bringing back ‘bobbies on the beat’, who would walk the same areas and get to know residents by name.\n44\nWe will support a satellite police station in Southend High Street.\n45\nWe will re-ignite the Special Constabulary scheme. It is a much under-publicised role that allows people to volunteer 16 hours of their time per month, where they are trained and have the same powers as regular Police Officers.\n46\nWe will re-start the Community Safety scheme where employers can fund select members of their workforce to join the wider police community.\n47\nWe will ban electric scooters on public pavements. We would also educate and inform residents of the legalities of electric scooters.\n48\nWe will look to re-open youth centres across Southend in order to reduce crime and provide a safe space where young people can occupy their time in an enjoyable and productive way, broaden their education, and gain easy access to mental health services.\n49\nWe will invest in extra security cameras and police resources in known crime hotspots for anti-social behaviour.\nHousing\n\"We need to ensure our infrastructure and services can sustain new developments\".\n50\nWe would work in partnership with Southend Homeless Action Network (SHAN) to put in place long-term strategies to end homelessness.\n51\nWe believe in the development of Queensway, but we will look to re-start the process with a more financially viable scheme.\n52\nWe will oppose increasing council rents.\n53\nWe support the enforcement of the affordable housing quota on property developers.\n54\nIt is accepted that planning applications have to be considered on their own merits, however, we would pursue planning and regulation that whenever a new development is being considered, provision of the necessary infrastructure must be included as part of it.\nTransport, Roads, Pavements and Parking\n\"We will bring in parking charges that support residents, business and visitors\".\n55\nFor any future plans regarding Queensway, we will be against filling in the road as it will create gridlock and cut off the businesses on Southchurch Road and Sutton Road.\n56\nWe will oppose charging for parking along the entire seafront from 6pm onwards.\n57\nWe would introduce 1-hour free parking, similar to Leigh, around Southend High Street.\n58\nWe are against closing car parks if it results in visitors causing congestion in residential parking nearby.\n59\nWe would oppose the introduction of cashless-only parking meters, and ensure they are all able to take both cash and card.\n60\nWe would launch a review of the cycle lanes on the seafront to enhance their safety.\n61\nWe would support fixing potholes across the City.\n62\nWe would support speed cameras in identified speeding hotspots in order to prevent accidents before they happen.\n63\nWe would support speed reductions in certain areas including 20 miles per hour zones – but only if residents from each road have collectively agreed.\n64\nWe are against pavements constantly being dug up by different companies carrying out works, then left looking in a poor state. Therefore, we would add a clause into the contracts for all companies who wish to work on our pavements to ensure all works are finished to a high quality that does not negatively impact the look of the area.\n65\nWe are against the disruption caused by multiple road closures at the same time due to infrastructure works, and will examine the current planning process with the objective of encouraging better coordination, including work that is carried out during the night.\n66\nWe will continue to campaign against the closures of ticket offices at train stations should the need arise.\n67\nWe would expand parking for motorcycles.\n68\nWe will look at how the shared space along ‘City Beach’ and the High Street can be made safer for both pedestrians and cyclists.\nSOUTHEND CONFELICITY MANIFESTO 2024\nEducation\n\"We need to connect education to careers in Southend\".\nWe believe in an education system underpinned by the belief that it should develop a person’s deep understanding of the world; encourages a love of learning; has intrinsic value to oneself and the community; and that it is a life-long endeavour.\nWe believe in an education system that trains our youth in ways that will directly contribute to the prosperity of themselves and society.\nWe will seek to create a true connection between education and careers, and ultimately create work opportunities where people can make a living doing what they love.\n69\nWe believe that everyone should have the opportunity to fulfil their potential through free education whether practical or academic, all the way through to PhD level education or professional apprenticeships.\n70\nWe believe in an education system where children receive the attention they need to flourish, whilst enjoying the social interactions of classmates. Therefore, our ideal aim is to reduce school class sizes to 12 children per teacher and Learning Assistant, and ensure all teachers are qualified. We fully appreciate this is wholly unrealistic, however, we would work towards this goal.\nThank you for taking the time to read our Southend manifesto.

No wasted votes here!\n- James Miller\n- Jun 7, 2024\n- 3 min read\nUpdated: Jun 12, 2024\nA local party for the national stage is the right idea. Who better than to voice our concerns in the House of Commons than Southend residents?\nAs residents of Southend, you are all free to attend our public meetings and vote on the issues of the day. If you become a member, which is permitted even if you belong to another party, you will be able to directly influence decisions taken at a national level.\nIf you ask me my political views and what I will do as your MP, although I have my opinions which I am more than happy to share, and a manifesto 70 pledges strong, we say it is the other way round: what do you think about all that goes on?\nWhile all the other parties rely on their HQs in London to dictate policy, we are obliged by Confelicity to put all issues that would require a vote in government onto our monthly manifesto agenda, where members can then discuss, debate and take a vote on the policies of the day.\nIt means if Lee and I become your MPs we can never take a vote without you and your voice and vote will directly affect the decisions taken in Westminster.\nUnless a vote on any particular subject is unanimous (I will spare you the details of our our ‘Undivided Democratic’ voting method for now), we will be free to make our decisions as we see right, but it will be taken with a comprehensive understanding of the consensus of Southend East and West residents in the room and the arguments of any objectors. We will know the percentage of Southend residents who are against or for a motion and how strongly they felt about it, and we will feel the consequences of whatever vote we would have taken at the next meeting!\nFor the first time you, yourself, will be able to influence what is outside your door on the national stage. One of the many reasons people in general are so turned off by politics is they can’t see how they can make a difference - well, this is it.\nWasted Votes a Myth\nI want us to break free from the shackles of the ancient party’s dogmas, agendas, bureaucracies and personal ambitions that plague them and our country as a consequence.\nThe main parties say don’t waste your vote on a fringe party, but that is one of the greatest political myths of all time. It is not the voting system that is necessarily the problem, it is the fallacy that you can only vote for who you think can win or stop winning.\nOvernight this could change if everyone washed that mindset away and voted by whom they connected with, whose manifesto they liked, which people they believed and believe in, and what organisation they could trust. This is perceived as naivety, but this is in fact the reality of our voting system.\nThe most powerful moment we have as citizens of the UK is the 30 seconds at the ballot box. Everything that has influenced us beforehand will determine where we put our cross, and my hope is you do so with a clear mind with a need to find out where all of our money has gone, have it spent without waste, corruption or incompetence, and spent in Southend where we know it needs to go!\nChange has been a long time coming, we just didn’t know how. As grandiose as it seems, we think we have an answer and it was in front of us the whole time: real local democracy. That is how we developed our manifesto and will continue to do so. I believe wholeheartedly that a truly democratic Southend resident party is the way forward, and that as your MPs we will ensure we will be the Southend voices you can recognise as your own in the Houses of Parliament.",

I should be there. I should be experiencing a lot of nerves and excitement while in hope of saying what I want to say in the right way. Instead, I will be driving home after a long day at work penning this blog.\nI was informed by the organisers of the hustings that I would not be invited to the Q&A section - essentially the hustings. Instead, I would have a 1 minute opening statement and then asked to leave the stage.\nTime was the overriding factor according to the organisers. With 10 candidates, they said it would be too ‘unwieldy’ and so five of the lesser known candidates and parties would have to get the chop.\nFor us, it was a kick in the teeth. Honestly, as a party we work hard. We hold manifesto meetings once a month and vote on matters of the day. We have to vote unanimously so it takes time and tough talk. It’s a great process in the end because the policies are more robust and we also know a lot of downsides of the argument. We believe in our manifesto. You can see it is written by Southend residents because it is so local. There is so much more to debate and I actually cannot wait to continue this process after the election. But the point being, we take great care with our policy and party.\nYou won’t believe how great our members are. From all walks of life in all professions, they love Southend and they love seeing if they can make a difference. Total passion and highly intelligent. Our members range from former Green to Reform because we vote issue by issue - we do not belong to any wing. And the great thing is the whole of Southend are invited.\nAs a member, you get a voice, a vote and the power of veto. This is what we mean when we say we are a local party for the national stage. It is literally the voice of Southend for the House of Commons!\nAnd yet, I find it absurd that the only Southend party in the election hasn’t been invited to participate fully at a Southend hustings.\nWe were told by the organisers they already had a broad line of views by including Tory, Labour, Lib Dem, Green and Reform, but I do not recall any party devoted to Southend and to locally led representation.\nAs your Southend MPs, both Lee Clark (in Southend East and Rochford) and myself, would have been obliged to hold monthly meetings about bills going through parliament. We would have to discuss, debate and dissect each item in partnership with our members who would take a vote. What’s even better is that our meetings are public and all Southend residents regardless of party are invited to take part. It will be the most democratic and engaging political process we have ever seen (or least one that I know of!).\nSome may be confused by our system, but most people agree about most things most of the time. When we don’t, Lee and I would still be empowered to make our decisions but we would do so with a complete understanding of how Southend feels.\nThis is unique and should have been on show tonight.\nThe optics for Confelicity are not necessarily good. Some may argue that even 1 minute is better than nothing and we should have been pleased to accept any opportunities that come our way. The issue our members had was that because our system is so unwaveringly democratic, the consensus was our presence would be condoning what is a wholly undemocratic hustings.\nAlmost all of me wants to be at the hustings tonight. Myself and my Confelicity friends tried everything we could but to no avail.\nThe organisers tried to compromise, but could not guarantee anything.\nI spoke to the other candidates and they graciously and commendably agreed we should be allowed to speak. Alas, to no avail.\nFrom an outside perspective it could be perceived as arrogance and petulance that we are not there tonight. Maybe it is and we are just not aware of ourselves! We may not be doing us any great favours by boycotting the event because there is a risk we could be seen as this or worse. However, there is a time for principles, and I am proud of our party to have shown such strength in our devotion to democracy.\nDespite all this I do want to wish all the candidates and parties well and to the organisers too. There has been mention of potential unrest and security issues, but I can assure everyone that this would never come from our end. Or if it did, we would address it with the upmost seriousness. Our party is founded on respectful free speech, not aggression and violence.\nGood luck to all and I look forward to the last few weeks on the campaign trail, starting with the SEND hustings on Thursday morning.",
  "https_www_southendconfelicityparty_co_uk_/https_www_southendconfelicityparty_co_uk_post_empowering-youth-and-transforming-southend-a-vision-for-the-future/content_22.html": "Empowering Youth and Transforming Southend: A Vision for the Future\n- Simon Jones\n- Oct 28, 2024\n- 5 min read\nUpdated: Oct 29, 2024\nSouthend is a town rich with potential, full of young people who represent the leaders, innovators, and change-makers of tomorrow. But like many communities, we face challenges—rising concerns about youth engagement and public safety. The Confelicity Party’s new, exciting manifesto pledge offers a bold, forward-thinking plan to tackle these issues head-on. It’s more than just a set of policies; it’s a commitment to our future, built on the belief that by empowering our youth, we can transform not just their lives but the very fabric of our community. Why Southend’s Youth Hold the KeyOur young people are Southend’s greatest asset. But without the right opportunities, guidance, and support, they can struggle to realise their potential. Too often, the pressures they face—whether academic, social, or economic—lead them down negative paths, contributing to anti-social behaviour and a sense of insecurity within the community. This manifesto is about changing that narrative. It’s about creating a Southend where every young person feels seen, supported, and valued. Where they’re given the tools, the space, and the encouragement to not just stay out of trouble but to truly thrive. We believe that when we invest in youth, we are investing in a future that is brighter, safer, and more inclusive for everyone. The Vision: Five Initiatives That Will Change LivesThe manifesto outlines five core initiatives that together form a powerful strategy for youth outreach and public safety. Each initiative is designed to not only address immediate concerns but to unlock long-term potential, providing young people with opportunities that can change their lives—and by extension, the future of Southend. 1. Southend Youth Zone: A Hub for GrowthAt the heart of this plan is the Southend Youth Zone—a state-of-the-art facility inspired by the successful OnSide Youth Zones model. This won’t just be a place to keep young people occupied; it will be a beacon of opportunity. A safe, vibrant space where they can explore their passions, from sports and arts to vocational training. It will be a space where creativity is nurtured, fitness is celebrated, and personal growth is encouraged. With access to everything from basketball courts and music production studios to coding workshops, the Youth Zone will be a launchpad for dreams. Through partnerships with local businesses, we’ll also offer internships, mentorships, and career guidance. The message is clear: Southend believes in its young people, and we’re investing in their future. 2. Expanded Sports and Arts Programmes: Building Discipline and ResilienceSports and arts are not just hobbies—they are powerful tools for personal development. By partnering with local sports clubs, schools, and community centres, we will offer programmes in boxing, martial arts, and team sports, inspired by the Fight for Peace model. These activities will teach discipline, teamwork, and resilience, helping young people develop the character and confidence they need to succeed in life. Targeting at-risk youth, these programmes will offer an alternative to negative influences, showing them that they have a place in this community, and that place is one of growth, leadership, and achievement. 3. Outdoor Adventure and Leadership: Finding Strength in NatureSouthend’s coastline and parks are some of its greatest treasures, and we will use these natural resources to create outdoor adventure programmes that inspire leadership and personal growth. Modelled after the Brathay Trust, these activities—like hiking, kayaking, and team-building exercises—will help young people connect with nature, develop self-confidence, and learn how to work together as a team. This initiative is about more than just getting young people outside. It’s about helping them realise their inner strength, showing them that they can overcome challenges, and encouraging them to step into leadership roles within their own lives and their communities. 4. Career and Enterprise Development: Unlocking Future PotentialEvery young person deserves the chance to build a career, and we are committed to helping them do just that. By working with The Prince’s Trust and local businesses, we will deliver employability workshops and entrepreneurship programmes that equip young people with the skills they need to succeed in the job market. Whether it’s learning digital media, hospitality, or customer service, our young people will be ready to step into Southend’s vibrant creative and tourism sectors—or even start businesses of their own. This initiative is about opening doors, giving young people the confidence to chase their dreams, and providing them with the tools they need to build a future that excites them. 5. First Aid and Violence Prevention: Empowering Youth to Save LivesPublic safety isn’t just about keeping young people out of trouble; it’s about empowering them to be part of the solution. Through the StreetDoctors programme, we will teach young people life-saving first aid skills with a focus on reducing the impact of street violence. This initiative will show them that they have the power to make a difference in their communities, turning bystanders into lifesavers. By teaching young people how to respond to emergencies, we’re not only giving them vital skills, but also fostering a sense of responsibility and care that will ripple through the community, helping to create a safer Southend for all. Building a Better Southend, TogetherThis pledge is about more than reducing crime or offering after-school programmes. It’s about creating a Southend where young people are given the respect, support, and opportunities they deserve. A Southend where they can flourish and contribute to the community in meaningful ways. When young people succeed, our entire town succeeds. Together, we can build a future where Southend’s streets are safer, our youth are more engaged, and the possibilities for growth and transformation are endless. Investing in our young people isn’t just the right thing to do—it’s the smartest investment we can make in our town’s future. The time to act is now. Let’s build a Southend that works for everyone—starting with our youth.\nFinancial Outline for Empowering Southend’s Youth Initiatives\nThe Confelicity Party’s pledge to transform youth engagement in Southend is ambitious yet financially\nachievable. Here’s a breakdown of estimated costs and potential funding sources for each initiative:\n1. Southend Youth Zone\no Initial Setup: £5 million to £10 million for construction and setup\no Annual Running Costs: £700,000 to £1.5 million for staffing and maintenance\n2. Expanded Sports and Arts Programmes\no Annual Costs: £50,000 to £100,000 for partnerships with local clubs and community centers\no Additional Funding: Support from youth charities and local sponsorships\n3.

Confelicity attacked for declaring we will volunteer our services if elected as Southend councillors\n- James Miller\n- Dec 4, 2024\n- 5 min read\nUpdated: Dec 7, 2024\nIt is an upside down world when Southend residents who want to volunteer their services to their city - if fortunate enough to be elected as local councillors in 2026 - are vilified for wishing to do so.\nOur policy, which is to return the councillor position to a voluntary role, is not to insult how hard councillors work and the work they do. It is not meant to allow only those who have the financial means to accommodate a voluntary role or to be interpreted as a measure of a councillor’s value.\nAlthough it will save around £1m, it is not meant as a money-saving exercise either.\nIt is only to say that all Confelicity candidates will stand on a voluntary platform, because through our discussion at a recent manifesto meeting, we found it marries nicely with our beliefs about civic pride and civic duty. Therefore, if Confelicity were to achieve a majority of 26 councillors or more at the 2026 local elections we will indeed look to introduce a policy that makes it a voluntary role for all. At the very least £10.4K will be saved per Confelicity councillor.\nConfelicity motion\nI did not put forward this motion on the Confelicity manifesto agenda. The member who raised it is hugely experienced in local political matters and who has lived and worked in Southend all their life. What they don’t know about local politics may not be worth knowing! Those who have suggested the motion is not thought out do not realise that it was already thought out and actioned as it was originally how the council was run.\nI must confess I would never have thought of re-introducing it as I had no problem with councillor pay. They look after roughly 3000 residents each and that can total a lot of emails, phone calls and meetings, as well reading reports and voting on various important matters. If anything I was surprised it wasn’t a whole lot more.\nWhen I received the suggested motion a few weeks before the Confelicity meeting I couldn’t see it going anywhere. I was interested in Cabinet pay as I felt this was excessive, but either way it wasn’t something I could see anyone getting behind. Our agenda included other issues I personally felt more attuned to such as youth outreach, campaigning against the Hadleigh Farm greenbelt development and a national topic of immigration numbers, but as it turned out, not only did I vote in favour, I have since become quite a zealot.\nLet’s talk about the money\nSavings\nThere are 51 councillors who each receive £10.4K and the Cabinet take anywhere up to £36K. When taking into account fairly recent debates about saving £25K by dimming street lights and losing dementia services at a saving of £250K, the value of this money is invaluable.\nThere are some who believe £1m is a pittance.\nWithin a multi-million pound local government budget it may appear small. Within a multi-billion pound national government budget infinitesimal. For the average person on the street this would be life-changing - but it’s all a matter of perspective. My perspective is £1m is a lot and especially so if it emanates from the taxpayer.\nWhen a potential saving of £1m exists, especially in the context of the well publicised financial distress of Southend Council (£8m projected deficit as we speak) if all councillors returned to the days when it was a vocation, then it should be taken seriously as a topic of debate.\nMoney and Quality\nI wouldn’t like to say whether today’s councillors are better quality or qualified than their predecessors because of the money, but the measure of achievement between past and present does not seem particularly correlated.\nNot to be the bearer of doom, but over the last few decades we have seen:\nThe decline of the high street; the longest pleasure pier in the world to nowhere; lack of public services and infrastructure; lack of social cohesion and civic pride; lost dementia services, sky-high parking charges; few career opportunities; wipe out of youth clubs; decline in general mental health; pot holed roads and cracked pavements; poor council investments such as Victoria, Seaway and Queensway; the dilapidated Kursaal; the knocking down of Warrior Square swimming pool - a primary draw to the town centre; closure of Southend Marine Activity Centre; loss of the Air Show; increase in homelessness and lack of housing for Southend residents; lost green spaces; sewage in our seas; spiralling costs for adult and child services; street lights dimmed at night, reduction of grass cutting and now we can’t even get our bins emptied more than once a week!\nYes, there are infinite reasons why yesteryear was a vast improvement on today and national government will be the most obvious culprit, but in the end we have paid somewhere in the region of an extra £20m to £30m in councillor allowances over the years and do we feel the result is satisfactory?\nWhilst the vast majority of councillors are passionate about Southend and work hard for residents, I do not believe there is concrete evidence to suggest paying councillors has produced better outcomes. These days all I hear at council meetings are different ways residents can be taxed, charged or fined, and residents are supposed to be thrilled when we are gifted (with our own money) with a brand new bin, as the Leader of the Council recently puff-chested about!\nQuestion to councillors\nTo be fair to all councillors today, they took on the position with the financial package in place and it would be wrong (and likely illegal) to change that unless they voluntarily gave up the allowance, so the question is would they? We’ve been bereft of sacrificial leadership for so long. All we hear is people taking - our new Prime Minister is a shameful testament to this, so this would be refreshing to say the least.\nWhen we first announced the policy it was most odd to have been attacked for saying we would volunteer our services, and while I fully acknowledge the arguments that the role takes a lot of time and that we might think about an amendment to ensure people on low incomes are not excluded, I believe very much that volunteering will bring no less quality and commitment than, at the very least, that which already exists. Just ask any volunteer across the city and they will tell you if working for free impedes their ability to carry out their labour of love.\nSo, to any Southend Councillors reading this, would you back a return to it being a voluntary role? Just as the Southend Confelicity Party intend to do.\nThis is the million pound question.",

The council’s acquisition of Victoria Shopping Centre and Southend’s potential expansion of its high street markets present brilliant opportunities for low cost start-ups.\nFighting against over-development due to lack of infrastructure and services and its encroachment onto our ever decreasing green spaces. Affordable housing on brownfield sites for locals - yes, but it is now time to acknowledge that we are getting close to full.\nExpanding capacity in Southend Hospital; fighting against current plans to transfer services to Basildon or Chelmsford; and valuing our health care workers properly. They are under-valued and under-paid, and that is a reflection on the value we have passively accepted for ourselves over many decades.\nCity-wide mass promotion of the Special Constable scheme to recruit hundreds into the local police. There are many hot-spots that require constant presence, and this is a sure-fire way of ensuring it can be resourced. No excuses about funding - just Southend residents putting themselves forward in the name of the city!\nPromoting financial transparency so we can see where all our money has gone. The technology already exists, it is just a question of access to the information. We are paying the most tax we ever have and we can’t even turn on our street lights to max, cut our grass more than once a year, fix our our pot holes and pavements, and get our bins emptied more than once a week! We are a rich nation, albeit with a £2.5 trillion debt(!), but something is going very wrong at the top. It is time for us all to find out what is going wrong.\nRid Southend’s sea of sewage by starting conversations with Anglian Water and the government to explore how we go about building a brand new sewage system fit for purpose. As it is, the current system is designed to allow sewage into our waters otherwise it would go into our homes and businesses during high rainfall. Southend should be built upon the water with Olympians showing off their prowess to the world! Instead, we lead the way in paddling and stone skimming!\nEnsure Southend United survives. With the brilliant consortium and devoted fans, the future is ready to be taken. We just need the right political decisions to taken to move this over the line. The previous owner must change his outrageous red-lines and get the deal done.\nInspire civic pride! We need to tell our own story, and one that will inspire the next generation to perform great feats for our city. I am reading the story of Eric Kirkham Cole of EKCO, and what a visionary he was employing 7,000 people and building tech for the world! This is just one of a thousand stories that we need to unearth and spread the good word! As part of promoting civic pride, we would like to explore ways in which we can inspire one volunteer hour a week from residents performing tasks that could never be budgeted for, to help and support the city in any way they could. Imagine what a million hours could do to transform the city?\nAnd for Leigh residents, I would seek to rectify the issues surrounding LTC and ensure that its future is safe. There is no getting around it, change needs to happen!\nFor our full manifesto see:",

It will also apply if a driver contravenes other traffic regulations such as parking on zig zag lines or double yellows.\nWith the information provided by the council we are left in the dark around certain questions:\nAre drivers allowed to drop off or pick up passengers in a council parking bay?\nHow long can drivers wait in the parking bay before they receive a fine?\nHow far away can the CEO take the photo?\nI have since spoken with several Civil Enforcement Officers who all slightly contradict each other.\nOne said drivers are allowed a minute or so window if the driver remains in the car, and others said in black and white terms you cannot use a council parking for anything other than parking - this includes pick-ups and drop offs. They did say that nine times out of ten the CEO would not fine someone, however, there is no guarantee as it depends on the person writing the ticket.\nIf the CEO’s are confused then what hope have the rest of us?\nThere is no signage around any council parking bays, as far as I have seen, that explains any of this and I can see a whole lot of perfectly innocent people getting stung.\nIs it really for school safety?\nRegarding the safety spin, Cllr. Terry, Independent Cabinet member for Community Safety and part of the Labour coalition, pointed out there were 44 deaths on Essex roads, but how many were actually on Southend roads caused directly from the use of a council parking bay? The answer will be none.\nHowever, not only was safety said to be the reason, he and his Labour teammates were even more specific by saying it was for safety around schools.\nEven though I was not arguing against keeping children safe, to argue against a policy wrapped around children’s’ safety was and is a difficult path to navigate. Easily mis-construed my argument could be become and so it was, particularly by Cllr. Terry.\nThe below are from social media and the Echo letters pages:\nAfter sharing my concerns of the fines on different channels, I should not have been surprised when it wasn’t met with the same distain I felt given how well packaged the children’s safety argument was delivered.\nAlthough many did indeed feel like me, there were a number of parents who were all for it - ‘anything to improve safety’ were some of the consensus’. And on this I completely understand. There are genuinely bad drivers out there and where it happens they need to be reported.\nHowever, parents face the daily obstacle course/mission impossible of picking up the children and very few, if any, vindictively go out of their way to purposely defy the rules of the road. Unfortunately, sometimes circumstances do push people in a certain direction and cause some chaotic situations.\nIt’s all very well calling them selfish, as Cllr Martin Terry does, but 99.99% of parents are just trying to pick their children up and get out of there. They did not set out a plan to wreak havoc on the roads!\nNone of this is to excuse bad driving and that is not to say there doesn’t need to be a set of solutions to reduce the risk, but something isn’t always better than nothing and this policy could actually make things worse.\nReverse Safety\nIt is foreseeable the drive away fine will exacerbate dangerous driving in certain circumstances where parents, eager to avoid the CEO, spots them from the corner of their eye and frantically pulls out in haste, ignoring what is in front of them and potentially hitting a child.\nIn the eyes of the law, the parent will be blamed - and understandably so - but isn’t it better to avoid putting people in this position in the first place?\nAs someone who has to think about health & safety as part of my day job, had I performed a risk assessment this policy would not have passed. If a policy increases risk then it should be withdrawn immediately. I remain unaware of any risk assessment that has taken place.\nFurthermore, parents might start parking in other places slightly further afield which simply moves the problem on.\nSolutions\nRegarding alternative solutions, former Independent Councillor, Brian Ayling, confirmed that back in 2019 the Policy & Resources Committee secured £250,000 funding for the Community Policing Support team. This team was designed to support and advise residents not fine or enforce them, assisting the community, and not there to add funds to the council.\nOther alternatives that I am sure have already been thought of include staggering pick-up times. For example, each year group has a 10 minute pick-up gap.\nThe ideal solution would be a digital booking system. It would be easy to do and fairly cheap in the grand scheme of things. If the root cause of problem is the number of cars on the road at any one time then it seems logical to try to reduce the number of cars that have to be there.\nThis would probably solve most things, however, there is no doubt supervision is also required. Many schools already have a team of volunteers as monitors, but maybe thought could be given to have them train on the specific part of the CEO course that deals with safety.\nMany suggest that parents walk or use other forms of active travel, and while that could be a solution for some, many others would not see that as feasible.\nOthers have suggested a school bus, but there are obvious finance implications here.\nThe point being is that there are many ideas that would alleviate this problem without lurching into our pockets.\nThe Money-grab\nI felt the instant I read this policy that it had little to do with school safety, but was I right?\nHad it been restricted only to schools then I may have backed down as it would be hard to argue if the council were targeting these specific areas.\nHowever, after several encounters with Cllr Terry on social media and clogging up the Echo letters page, which included him accusing me of ‘clickbait’ and ‘popularism’, I had asked him whether this was a city-wide policy rather than just for schools, and he answered “this is specifically for schools”.\nI might have left it but I thought before I shut the case down I might check if the council had published anything. A quick search of Google and the Drive Away policy appeared top-rank via the Southend Council website, where oddly enough it turned out it was for the whole city, meaning he either lied or didn’t know his own policy. It was actually in the original Echo article too, just overshadowed by the children’s safety aspect.\nFor clarification, this is the actual policy:\nAs you may have read, it targets indiscriminately across every road in the city, and being that nearly all roads in Southend are statistically safe (i.e. there are zero incidents/accidents on almost every road across Southend), and particularly council parking bays where very few problems have ever existed aside from nicks as people mid-judge the space, it cannot be possible that safety was the primary motivator - if at all.\nWhy fine people in areas that have never had any accidents, incidents or near misses?\nNevertheless, Cllr. Terry then willingly misconstrued my stance in further Echo letter pages that myself and Confelicity “support law breakers and dangerous drivers!”\nAny right minded person would never think like this, so it is quite impossible to draw this conclusion.\nHe might of said that my reasoning wasn’t sound and didn’t make any sense, but there looks to have been an intent to paint a specific picture and cause specific reputational damage.\nConclusion: For safety or for money?\nPark properly and never get fined - absolutely. However, this policy is unclear, lacks details as to how this will work in practice and lacks evidence to strongly support an enhancement of safety. Many may receive fines without knowing that they shouldn’t have done so and I would urge you to write to Cllr Terry for confirmation of the rules.\nThe vast majority of us want to stick to the rules by driving safely and definitely don’t want to receive a fine for going about our day-to-day lives without watching over our backs and feeling like criminals.\nConfelicity has now unanimously voted to pause the implementation of this policy until the details have been established. From then we will no doubt take another vote as to whether we believe it is in the best interest of the residents of Southend - a vote that all Southend residents are welcome to take with us at our bi-monthly manifesto meetings.\nReference",

My education was a difficult after attending what was then known as Thorpe Bay High, but I did eventually go to university as a mature student achieving a Masters in Business Administration (MBA).\nI am a Company Director and have worked in the leisure and tourism industry for almost 30 years. I grew up on social benefits and that has never left me, but now as someone who has been lucky enough to have had the chances that I did in the end, I seek to give back to our city.\nMy Politics\nI had previously voted for the Labour Party as soon as I was able to. I became a paid up member for over 15 years and stood as a Labour candidate in the local elections in Southend. For reasons that I lay our here, I decided to found a new, locally focussed and truly democratic party.\nMy politics is be as successful as your drive takes you, but pay your fair share, and that fair share be spent without corruption, waste or incompetence. What that fair share is exactly is dependent on the needs of the time. But lower tax generally enables a good business environment which in-turn creates the jobs and disposable income needed to pay for the excellent public services we all want.\nI believe in people being free to make their own choices, but we should try to be as respectful to each other as we can.\nI am completely sold on local people making the decisions rather than instructions coming from London by people who have never been to Southend. What could they possibly know that would trump our experience of living here?\nI believe in real democracy, which means asking people their opinions and finding the truth together. Most people agree on most things most of the time and working together in partnership really is possible if done in the right way.\nI believe in an ideal version of the future. I want to know where we are heading, but I want to know if that place is somewhere I want to go. For the Southend Confelicity Party, this is creating an environment where we can all fulfil our potential for the betterment of ourselves and our city. It means working backwards from where we agree we want to be in all areas.\nStanding for Leigh\nI love Leigh and all that it has to offer, however, there is no doubt that the balance between a thriving town and the happiness of residents has become increasingly difficult with issues such as parking and anti-social behaviour coming at the top of the list.\nIt has become a victim of its own success as more and more people wish to live here. More flats are being built without sufficient provision for parking or general infrastructure, which is exacerbating the problem further.\nThe question I would is are whether residents think building should be stopped? If, indeed, it could be.\nYet, even if all building stopped tomorrow the problem remains. Resident parking may help, but may cause even more problems as drivers continue to search for that one last parking spot. The 2 hour free parking on Leigh Broadway may need to be reviewed. Is there even room for a multi-story or underground parking?\nNo one has yet come up with the answer, but we really need to get together and work out what we want in partnership. Then, perhaps, we can move forward with an agreement that most might like to see.\nIn terms of anti-social behaviour, this really is often fuelled by alcohol. Very few people would argue there should be a blanket ban, but perhaps the bars could reassure residents about how they manage selling alcohol to those who clearly have had enough. This is the root of the problem and it would be much better to prevent incidents before they happen. It is in no one's interests for fights to break out and business reputations ruined, and so that interaction between bar staff and customer is key. It is all so easy just to keep serving when the right thing to do is get them a taxi home. There is much that could be done in this area, and as a local businessman I would be very well placed to facilitate these kind of discussions.\nHowever, on the occasions when situations do get out of hand then we do need to deploy police in these areas at.\nI am personally in touch with the Specials Supported Policing Coordinator from Specials Command, and I believe there is much that could be done to build up the number of Specials from Leigh itself. Specials have the same powers as Police Constables and would be just what is required given the budgetary restrictions that we have had to come to terms with. I am sure there will be at least ten residents that would be willing to put themselves forward to help protect residents, they just need to know about it. I believe this would be a straightforward mission to have this communicated and one that I am willing to lead.\nAs your Leigh ward Councillor I will pick up the phone and listen. I will read your emails and respond. I will get us together and work our issues out. As crass as it sounds, I intend to 'stop stupid' when it comes to obviously bad decisions taken by the council and bring a fresh set of eyes and ideas that will bring civic pride back to Southend.\nI know that many residents vote to ensure the party they dislike the most do not get in. But I can tell you that almost all the residents I have spoken to have said they are not against a local party representing them. They have said that however they have voted in the past nothing has really changed, and so I urge you to read our manifesto and make a decision based on whether you agree with it. Wouldn't it be nice to actually vote for a party you actually like to like!?\nI was proud to stand as our Confelicity candidate in the recent General Election for which our main goal was to spread our local message. I look forward to standing again in the next General Election. For more information click here.\nMayor of Essex\nWith the distinct possibility of devolution and local government reorgansation on the horizon over the next couple of years, I have been elected as our representative for Mayor of Essex.

With hearsay suggesting some wish for its demise, I just couldn't disagree more. I am a huge advocate of local people being able to fix, change, enhance and prevent anything they collectively agree on.\nThe Southend Confelicity Party is founded on a local platform. If you want to know the difference between us and everyone else, it is primarily that. We face each issue as it comes and we dissect, discuss and debate until we either reach unanimous agreement or we are empowered to pursue our individual views in a respectful manner. No left wing or right wing. No ancient obligations to parties born from different eras with different needs to today - just what we believe is right as residents of Southend. I believe there is room for a local party on the council, but that will be up to residents.\nLondon vs Southend\nIn an ideal world, we would like to see more powers and resources devolved to Southend from London because we believe the people who have first-hand experience of an area will be best placed to make decisions for it. It is doubtful that those who make policy for the major parties include anyone who understands Leigh and Southend. For example, when Sir Kier Starmer says he'll bring back national housing targets - meaning another 20,000 more in Southend over the next 10 years - does anyone believe he personally understands the impact that would have on our infrastructure and public services?\nThe same argument cannot quite apply to Southend and Leigh or Southend and any other district across the city. Most of us have lived, worked or played in all corners and have a fairly decent understanding of its varying parts. However, Southend is bigger geographically and by population than many of us think, and there are quite a number of issues individual to each of the eight districts/neighbourhoods that only the residents of that area can truly understand. And what better way to deal with these issues than with a legal body able to act as the facilitator and protector of its residents needs?\nParish Councils\nThere is an argument to say a parish council, such as Leigh Town Council, is just another layer of bureaucracy, but I believe the opportunities vastly outweigh the disadvantages if run to its full potential. Others argue LTC can do little more than agree on flower displays and community events, which, if it was just that, would still make it invaluable. Yet, this grossly undervalues its true power. According to the government website, \"They provide communities with a democratic voice and a structure for taking community action.\"\nSome will be aghast for me saying this, but I believe so much in the principle of local people running things that I would suggest other areas of Southend think about forming their own parish councils.\nResident associations are the next best thing to a parish council and those that run them go out of their way to help and support residents as best they can. However, as good as they are, they have no real power. For example, the 10,000 strong Shoeburyness Resident Association has been unable to stop Taylor Wimpey chopping down around 100 trees for their new development, and from Bellway building on the flood plains between Barge Pier Road and Ness Road and carting 85,000 truck movements of soil throughout Southend over the next few years. Try as they might, and they have tried, it is still happening to the dismay of residents.\nShoeburyness used to have two parish councils, which were disbanded in the 1930s as they became absorbed into Southend Council. Do you think if those councils still ran that it would be possible for those two developments to exist as they are? Whilst they, like Southend Council, would have to work within planning law, there is no doubt the protest against Taylor Wimpey and Bellway would have had a much stronger footing had they been backed by a Shoeburyness Council where residents couldn't so easily be swatted away the way in which they have been so far. Just imagine if developers somehow won approval to build on the Belton Hills Nature Reserve. Do you think Leigh Town Council would just sit there and do nothing? No, it would become the HQ of the battle of Belton!\nLTC to take lead against over-development\nOnce the current unrest between residents and the current LTC administration is sorted out, perhaps LTC, as a body, can become the lead protagonist in preventing the over-development of flats without sufficient provision of parking, services, infrastructure and general disruption to Leigh residents - topics that have caused endless discussion without any solution. Because if there is one thing above all else Leigh residents can be united on, it is this.\nIt is not to begrudge developers, they've every right to want to make a living, and those that live in these new homes are no doubt very grateful - Leigh is a fantastic place to live! However, even as a Director of a company involved in property development myself, there is no doubt that we would respect the decision to say no more. There is no point living in a town if you can't enjoy it!\nLeigh is now cornered into a position that only an expansion of public car parks can alleviate some of the problem. But where? How much? Is it feasible? And do Leigh residents really want that? As we know, we are far too late in the day to change what has already been, but it is not too late for LTC to lead the charge in these issues if that is, indeed, what residents want.\nThe founders of LTC did a great thing. May those who run it today continue to respect its purpose and take advantage of its true value, because if there is any danger of it capitulating, it would open Leigh up to the dangers that Shoeburness and other areas of Southend suffer today. That is not to discredit Southend Council or the ward councillors, they have their objectives to follow and it is not always easy to work around the system. But that is where a united LTC can come into its own.",

They need money, resources and respite.\nThe SEND hustings in Southend East and Rochford received coverage as some parties were vilified for not turning up (including us)!\nHowever, last week’s SEND hustings for Southend West and Leigh has gone nearly unnoticed.\nEight of the ten candidates attended and the room was well occupied. The Chair was a former Southend Councillor who knew the problems and was passionate about bringing the issues to light with the organisers ‘Making Care Fair’, a National Lottery funded organisation that seeks to change certain aspects of the system.\nWhilst I was taking part and shortly afterwards it actually felt like something good was going to come of it. There was an outpouring of support and sympathy with a real gusto to get things moving in the right direction - but unfortunately nothing has really taken off since.\nThe Hustings\nAfter the opening statements from candidates and a few questions, it became the audience vs Anna Firth.\nAnna fielded a lot of the anger and frustration, and as the representative of the Conservatives, it made sense for the rest of the candidates to step aside and allow the audience to express themselves to Anna.\nWhat can be hard to accept is that Anna, even as the MP, has very little power. She likely had nothing to do with any of the government’s policies and the best she could as do was to offer to speak to someone who did.\nIn the specific cases at the hustings, Anna did offer her help and there seemed some ray of hope in this - she was listening. With the many across the country who experience similar dire circumstances, they have very few places to turn.\nFor me, I knew when going into the hustings I did not know enough. I have friends and relatives badly affected by the system, but I have not experienced it firsthand.\nI am proud to say that in my day job I employ and look after hundreds of those with SEND and I understand the reasonable adjustments required to make them feel valued, comfortable and supported (Anna, was very gracious to mention the work that we do). Everyone is unique in their experiences and they need to be treated as an individuals. But I am far from an expert.\nWhere I could help is changing the attitudes of CEO/Directors of organisations that would never even think of employing people with SEND. Business may not think they have the time, money or resources, but if they knew just how much potential there is out there, they would quickly change their minds. The stigma surrounding the word SEND is quite a significant barrier and this can only change if those associated with the community get the opportunity to sit around the table with those that have the power to change so many lives.\nA snapshot of the Issues\nAccessing financial assistance is far too complicated. Some suggested it was purposeful and that is the cynicism that has been building. How did the government concoct such a complicated and, being as fair I can, mean system? Carers did not write this system that much I’m sure of. They would have known the flaws from the outset. From the voices we heard, it seems unlikely that any carers or people with SEND had any input at all.\nAnother issue is that the level of available finance is far too low if we are framing it within a dignified life. One resident was left with £15 per week when all was said and done.\nA member of the audience said that some cannot work due to their disability, but they should still be entitled to enjoy their lives. At the moment there is nothing for them to do. Policies around this area would be very welcome.\nThe carers allowance should not be a taxable benefit. A carer is effectively paid less than the minimum wage as they work 140 hours a month for £260. Moreover, if the carer works minimum hours the government stops the carer allowance for that week and they end up owing them!\nThey added that if a person is born with a disability they should not have to reapply for the Personal Independent Payment (PIP) repeatedly because their condition is not going to change!\nFinally, financial assessment for any care package should allow for household expenses like electricity and/or gas as a rule.\nBy the end of the hustings I knew more, but that was just scratching the surface. I could feel the pain of the audience. So much struggle and little relief.\nGoing forward\nThe question is who should write the policy?\nMy simple answer, like all polices, is that it needs to be written by the people most affected - in this case, those with SEND and their carers. This then needs to be weighed up against what is possible given barriers such as money, resources and expertise.\nAnd that is where we come in. I happened to mention that with Confelicity they would be able to do this. We would hold several SEND specific manifesto meetings in which they could write the agenda and debate the policies.\nThe issues highlighted at the hustings would be a great start.\nFor the first time, power would be in the hands of a those who know the most. And this is what we mean by being a local party for the national stage. People writing policies who have been there and done it.\nFor any carers reading this please do get in touch with us and we will let you know when the meetings are taking place.\nLet’s not allow this important issue to be forgotten.",

My education was difficult after attending what was then known as Thorpe Bay High, but I did eventually go to university as a mature student achieving a Masters in Business Administration (MBA).\nI have worked in my family business for almost 30 years and have learnt so much in all aspects of life. With humility, I have been lucky enough to understand how success is achieved. I grew up on social benefits through circumstances that couldn't be helped and that has never left me, and as someone who has been lucky enough to have the chances that I did in the end, I seek to give back to our city.\nAs a Southend boy, born and bred, I am super-keen to pour any experience and knowledge I have into our city.\nI stand representing the Southend Resident’s Party, which is devoted to a true local voice on the national stage.\nMy Politics\nMy politics is be as successful as your drive takes you, but pay your fair share, and that fair share be spent without corruption, waste or incompetence. What that fair share is exactly, is dependent on the needs of the time. But lower tax generally enables a good business environment which in-turn creates the jobs and disposable income needed to pay for the excellent public services we all want.\nI believe in people being free to make their own choices, but we should try to be as respectful to each other as we can.\nI am completely sold on local people making the decisions rather than instructions coming from London by people who have never been to Southend. What could they possibly know that would trump our experience of living here?\nI believe in real democracy, which means asking people their opinions and finding the truth together. Most people agree on most things most of the time and working together in partnership really is possible if done in the right way.\nI believe in an ideal version of the future. I want to know where we are heading, but I want to know if that place is somewhere I want to go. For the Southend Confelicity Party, this is creating an environment where we can all fulfil our potential for the betterment of ourselves and our city. It means working backwards from where we agree we want to be in all areas.\nPriority issues for Southend\n-\nInspiring Southend residents to start their own businesses, applying their skills and knowledge to creating a city full of innovation and entrepreneurship to revitalise jobs and wealth creation. The council’s acquisition of Victoria Shopping Centre and Southend’s potential expansion of its high street markets present brilliant opportunities for low cost start-ups.\n-\nFighting against over-development due to lack of infrastructure and services and its encroachment onto our ever decreasing green spaces. Affordable housing on brownfield sites for locals - yes, but it is now time to acknowledge that we are getting close to full.\n-\nExpanding capacity in Southend Hospital; fighting against current plans to transfer services to Basildon or Chelmsford; and valuing our health care workers properly. They are under-valued and under-paid, and that is a reflection on the value we have passively accepted for ourselves over many decades.\n-\nCity-wide mass promotion of the Special Constable scheme to recruit hundreds into the local police. There are many hot-spots that require constant presence, and this is a sure-fire way of ensuring it can be resourced. No excuses about funding - just Southend residents putting themselves forward in the name of the city!\n-\nPromoting financial transparency so we can see where all our money has gone. The technology already exists, it is just a question of access to the information. We are paying the most tax we ever have and we can’t even turn on our street lights to max, cut our grass more than once a year, fix our our pot holes and pavements, and get our bins emptied more than once a week! We are a rich nation, albeit with a £2.5 trillion debt(!), but something is going very wrong at the top. It is time for us all to find out what is going wrong.\n-\nRid Southend’s sea of sewage by starting conversations with Anglian Water and the government to explore how we go about building a brand new sewage system fit for purpose. As it is, the current system is designed to allow sewage into our waters otherwise it would go into our homes and businesses during high rainfall. Southend should be built upon the water with Olympians showing off their prowess to the world! Instead, we lead the way in paddling and stone skimming!\n-\nEnsure Southend United survives. With the brilliant consortium and devoted fans, the future is ready to be taken. We just need the right political decisions to taken to move this over the line. The previous owner must change his outrageous red-lines and get the deal done.\n-\nInspire civic pride! We need to tell our own story, and one that will inspire the next generation to perform great feats for our city. I am reading the story of Eric Kirkham Cole of EKCO, and what a visionary he was employing 7,000 people and building tech for the world! This is just one of a thousand stories that we need to unearth and spread the good word! As part of promoting civic pride, we would like to explore ways in which we can inspire one volunteer hour a week from residents performing tasks that could never be budgeted for, to help and support the city in any way they could. Imagine what a million hours could do to transform the city?\n-\nAnd for Leigh residents, I would seek to rectify the issues surrounding LTC and ensure that its future is safe. There is no getting around it, change needs to happen!\nAnd finally\nAs your MP, I will pick up the phone and listen. I will read your emails and respond. I will get us together and work our issues out. As crass as it sounds, I intend to 'stop stupid' when it comes to obviously bad decisions and bring a fresh set of eyes and ideas.\nI know that many residents vote to ensure the party they dislike the most do not get in. But I can tell you that almost all the residents I have spoken to have said they are not against a local party representing them. They have said that however they have voted in the past, nothing has really changed, and so I urge you to read our manifesto and make a decision based on whether you agree with it. Wouldn't it be nice to actually vote for a party you actually like to like!?\nThank you for taking an interest and I sincerely hope you can find faith in me at the next elections.\nKind regards\nJames Miller\nSouthend Confelicity Party Leader\nParliamentary Candidate for Southend West\nMob: 07896219268\nEmail: jamesmillersouthendconfelicity@gmail.com",

Right or wrong, this decision opened up our city to the possibility of fortnightly collections.\nThe Conservatives fought the 2023 local elections on the basis they would ensure bin collections were weekly, but after winning found that wasn’t possible siting the substantial £14m projected budget deficit that they steadfastly stated were not aware of previous to the election.\nHaving been a primary Conservative policy, Labour couldn’t be blamed for licking their lips as they dutifully informed Southend residents of this broken promise.\nPersonally, I had a couple of problems with this. Firstly, a broken election promise does not excuse Labour’s financial mis-management. By the time the Tories lost the election in 2024 the deficit was down to around £1.9m. Incidentally, the projected deficit is now back up to £8m under Labour with Adult and child social care highlighted as the main culprit once again.\nSecondly, as Labour were the founders of the fortnightly bin collections it was predictably disingenuous to omit this information as they went for the Conservative’s open goal. Alas it is politics!\nIn the end it was Labour who then said they couldn’t reverse the decision by the Tories and here we are: in 2024, with all the technology at our fingertips and with the highest taxation since the war, we can’t even get our bins emptied!\nHappy?\nFor us political laymen it doesn’t really matter how we got here, us residents are left to deal with the consequences.\nThere are some who are quite happy with it. They have seen it work in other places and don’t mind our streets adorned with wheelie bins. I can see one, so far under-sold benefit, and that is it will encourage residents to re-cycle.\nBasildon might attest otherwise to any benefits at all after residents were left furious with the results. And which party is riding to the rescue? Yes, you guessed it - the Labour Party! They vowed to “fix the bins” and return weekly-bin collections to the residents of Basildon!\nTo be fair, what’s right in one part of the country (or just down the road) may not be right in another.\nPerhaps Southend residents will love the changes and it will be the right thing after all.\nPerhaps we will all have been worrying about nothing and we just lacked the foresight of our political rulers.\nEither way, we only have eight years to endure!\nSo, does this change make us a city to be proud of?\nAbsolutely not!\nThis now tiresome slogan repeated after every sentence of a speech duly carried out by any member of the current Labour administration, is now grossly out of place. I cannot remember feeling a sense of civic pride walking past wheelie bins, fly tip mountains, rats and cockroaches!\nCall me dramatic, but there is a demoralising symbolism to all this. The message is we are not worth it and don’t deserve to be kept in a manner we have grown to expect. And there is more pain to come according to national Labour.\nYet, if we really want to build a city to be proud of we need to keep it clean and tidy. When we talk about civic pride this is the first thing we recognise.\nThis decision must be reversed and plans must be made to spare the necessary funds long before a repeat of the excuse that we cannot afford it.",
  "https_www_southendconfelicityparty_co_uk_/https_www_southendconfelicityparty_co_uk_post_3-new-manifesto-pledges-agreed-our-most-controversial-yet/content_17.html": "3 of the ugliest and morally questionable manifesto pledges we have agreed so far\n- James Miller\n- Feb 8, 2024\n- 3 min read\nSet against the backdrop of national debt of £2.5 trillion, interest payments of which equate to the fourth largest department in the budget, and a continuous overspend of billions of pounds each quarter further adding to the debt, it is nearly impossible for Southend to ever see the £50 million grants returning to ease the ever increasing financial burden that sees the council heading towards de-facto bankruptcy, and a raft of jobs and services cut.\nThe previous coalition were going to charge us to park in our parks; reduce grass cutting to once a year under the guise of re-wilding; keep our street lighting below 100%; evict Jazz UK, charge to go to the toilet; allowed tenders for fortnightly bin collections; and increased council tax repeatedly by the maximum 5% and increased parking and other fees and charges by 10%. Now, we face cuts to dementia, family centres; non-statutory adult social services, discussions on sick pay; have just about avoided the closure of libraries for now, and it is confirmed our bin collections are going fortnightly. Whether through waste, incompetence or corruption, we pay enormous amounts of tax and yet all parties are faced with the same impossible choices.\nAside from efficiencies that should already be identified and rectified, we can no longer afford to pay what we do, and we either sack people and lose services or reduce the amount we pay for them.\nMany have questioned the morality of this line of thought and many of our members had deep concerns, but is it better to cut dementia services or ask the higher tiers of the council to take a small cut? Because that is the choice and we have chosen the latter.\nThe 3 Votes\nWe voted to support a review of the Executive team’s remuneration with a view to reduce or freeze their pay. A 10% cut would save £200K and would enable dementia services to continue as they are. It would also act as a symbolic move that may restore faith back into our leadership. It may also inspire our next policy to support implementing voluntary remuneration reviews for all staff above £50K. A 10% cut, for example, would save vast sums that may help to keep the libraries open. Lastly, we voted in favour of reducing the remuneration packages of all new council employees once the post has been left vacant.\nIn normal circumstances, council remuneration would never be an issue to discuss, however, in the current financial environment we are in desperate times, and extraordinary actions are needed for consideration.\nThere are some who call the idea of imminent bankruptcy 'hyperbole', but the council has been risk assessed as 4 out of 4 on both counts of the severity of bankruptcy and the likelihood of it happening according to the Corporate Risk Register. The consequences are that only statutory services will likely continue as commissioners come in and make their decisions about how to keep Southend going.\nFor those who work in the council, this will no doubt cause enormous stress and anxiety, and we certainly are not looking to vilify or scapegoat anyone.\nIt feels like political suicide, but Southend is far more important than a political party. We truly believe it is the right thing to do given the circumstances.\nThere are potentially other ways to avoid this by utilising the Capital Receipts Flexibility Programme, which enable assets to be sold and proceeds used if it is forecast to generate ongoing revenue savings and/or demand for services in the future. (I await my question at Full Council on 22nd February on this). For example, the £10m locked in the Victoria Shopping Centre acquisition could be sold off. And being that Wilkos' exit puts revenues under threat and that £4m has been spent on repairs so far, it could be a welcome sale for many reasons.\nWe never set out to launch such ugly policies, and no one is proud of the vote we have taken. However, the question I have asked those who have taken an opposing view is what would they do instead?\nSo far, the answers have yet to come. Only scathing attacks and cries of immorality. But, as already mentioned, which is more immoral? Sacking people or retaining jobs and services?\nThis vote was taken unanimously by all members who attended the meeting.

This means if you are passionate about any particular subject that has not yet been voted on, you could join, raise the motion, and become an integral part of shaping that policy.\nWe are proud of our manifesto, which seeks to bring Southend together. It will be costed by a mixture of public and private funding, as we work in partnership with stakeholders from across the city.\nConfelicity Explained\nAs a new party I have taken the liberty to explain what we are all about. Firstly, the name! We were going to be called the Southend Party, but stumbled upon Confelicity after discovering it meant 'joy in other's happiness, which we felt was apt for what we are trying to achieve.\nThe vision of Confelicity is to create an environment where all of us can feel happy in our lives with feel a deep sense of meaning and purpose for the future, on the path to fulfilling our potential for the betterment of ourselves and Southend.\nFor too long there has been confusion about the true aspirations of all the parties, but we ought to know exactly where we are going long-term. For this reason, we believe in the principle of idealism, which is basically visualising the most ambitious future in all areas of the political arena and working backwards from there.\nThe harder part is the how?\nWhilst espousing wild dreams of how we want our city and country to be, we fully acknowledge this isn’t realistic politics! For this reason we believe in the overtly pretentious term pragmatism, as we accept and work against the practicalities and realities of life. So many different agendas are at play such as financial, moral, religious and philosophical differences, as well as party dogmas and bureaucracies that can and do prevent progress. And more than anything else: money, power and resources.\nIn regard to power and resources, we believe in Localism. We believe those that walk the pavements should have the power to fix them! Over the course of history, power has become centralised in London within a small group of people. The question is why would any of them care about Southend? We care because we live here. If Southend Hospital is overwhelmed it is us who suffer - not them. For far too long our politicians can only pay lip service to our issues and apologise. Do you really believe any of the parliamentary candidates from the national parties are able to do any of what they speak about? They, themselves, would have had zero say in their manifestos and are fed lines from Party HQ. We believe it is time for Southend people to be represented by those who themselves are affected by the decisions that they take.\nWe believe in Undivided Democracy where democracy recognises differences, but does not divide. This means if only one member does not vote on a policy, the Party are instructed to deconstruct the individual’s reasoning to a point where agreement can be found. If agreement cannot be found the policy will never pass under Confelicity. Too many times division is caused by polarised arguments that democracy itself contributes to, causing alienation, isolation and indignation for those individuals that are on the wrong of the vote. Only by working together in partnership can the crux of the difference be found as opposed to the sharp edge of the democratic vote. We therefore believe in freedom of speech, debate and discussion in order to reach a conclusion that has been made in partnership and a spirit of unity. We believe in a collaborative approach where conflicting parties can either find common ground together, or in cases where this has not been achieved, the subject is put to one side whilst further research can be carried out. This collaborative approach relies on each subject matter being explored, interrogated, and scrutinised with rigour and a level of critique that should include information on funding, agendas and affiliations. On the conditions Confelicity values are upheld, in the meantime, members are free to express themselves on any issue as they see fit.\nWe believe in a leadership philosophy that acts as a partner, facilitator and collaborator. We believe that any rule or law that is agreed by Confelicity must be followed by the Leader and all Party members. We intend to set the leadership standard as high as possible and reject hypocrisy and cronyism. We find any kind of government corruption abhorrent and will enact a zero tolerance on any behaviours that do not coincide with these standards in or outside the party. We believe that power needs a system of checking, challenging, scrutiny, rigour and total transparency and should be diluted as much as possible to fend against those that do misuse their power. Hence the voting structure of our Party empowers all members with the power of veto.\nWhich ties into our last point: our culture. When you come off a conversation with us we hope you will be able to feel our sense of empathy, kindness and humility. That you were able to enjoy the conversation in an atmosphere of respectful free speech without judgment as we showed patience, tolerance and forgiveness where necessary. (For too long, those who might consider themselves good people have felt compelled to admonish others as the self-proclaimed arbiters of moral judgment!). And you trust us because we are open and honest in our answers.\nPolitics is in desperate need of authentic change and we believe we can be that for Southend.\nI sincerely hope that you can connect with what we are trying to do and hope you can put your faith in us when the time comes.\nYours faithfully\nJames Miller BA (hons), MBA\nSouthend Confelicity Party Leader\nParliamentary Candidate for Southend West and Leigh\nEconomy\n\"We need to build seeds of industry to grow new business and create jobs\".\nWe live in a capitalist society, which relies on people taking resources and transforming them into something profitable. Through this jobs are created and real wealth is put in people’s hands which can be spent in other businesses creating more. Every party works within this economic model and we are no different. If the goal is to create wealth so we can all enjoy a good life then it is government’s mission to ensure the business environment is encouraged.\nWhilst inward investment is always required from well-established organisations, our intention is to create full employment by creating the most fertile SME business environment possible for entrepreneurship to flourish. This includes lowering the risk of business failure by helping to reduce costs, and creating a business infrastructure and entrepreneurial culture that would encourage as many people to use their talents and start their own businesses.\nWe believe the tax system should incentivise councils to grow business and therefore should be rewarded for facilitating a thriving economy by growing alongside the business success they help create, instead of relying on counter-productive tax policies.\nWe encourage people to become as wealthy as their business or job enables them to be, however, we recognise that the resources used to generate their income would, in many cases, deprive other citizens of their use i.e. land, materials, people, etc. Therefore, it is expected that citizens will be recompensed accordingly through the tax system to a level that both continues to encourage re-investment of the business and supply the necessary investment into public services we all want.\nWe acknowledge that the cost of living is a fundamental barrier to the prospects of individual wealth and prosperity, and we would seek to redress the balance by supporting those industries that are fundamental to national infrastructure back into public hands in order to cap bills to an affordable level for all.\n1\nSouthend High Street has the potential to reshape its contribution to the City. It can thrive again, we just need to address the basic fundamentals of what makes a High Street work:\n-\nWe need to bring all the landlords together to work alongside the Council and other stakeholders to agree on a singular vision.\n-\nImproving parking, cleanliness, greenery with seasonal displays, safety and the general environment is a must, but ultimately it is the shops that people come for, so all our efforts should be geared towards filling the empty retail units with reputable businesses that will be assets to the shopping experience.\n-\nIn order to fill the shops we need a way to transfer the skills and knowledge of people who have qualified in various courses at the college and university, as well as everyone else who has talent, passion and an entrepreneurial spirit across the City, directly into the units to create the most unique high street in the country.\n-\nPotential entrepreneurs need to be reassured that they actually have a chance of making it work by lowering all business costs, allowing them enough time to build a strong customer base, with a gradual incremental increase in rates overtime.\n-\nWe need to make it easy for local people to set up a business by providing expert business support who can give them the knowledge to succeed. We would raise awareness of all available start-up support.\n-\nWe will bring back indoor/outdoor markets to act as the hub of local entrepreneurship whilst providing a unique shopping experience in Southend High Street.\n-\nWe recognise that national brands are vital to any high street and we should continue to do everything to attract them with favourable rates. Unfortunately they have found online a far more cost-effective and efficient way of operating so this will be a challenge. It is time to do it ourselves.\nImagine a High Street full of shops selling unique products and services run by local owner/operators, making a living doing what they love – just like it used to be!\n2\nWe will seek to create a meaningful and practical connection between education and careers in Southend, and ultimately create work opportunities where people can make a living doing what they love.\nWe would embark on a journey of planting seeds of industry and enterprise, looking at suitable brownfield sites to develop professional infrastructure for both online and offline businesses, where in years to come we can start to see quality career opportunities in engineering, tech, arts, fashion, film, music, catering, and so on, here in Southend.\n3\nWe will re-open the redundant ‘Beach Club’ Southend Activity Marine Centre. Southend should be built on the water, yet most residents have never had the opportunity to sail. We would work with community leaders who are seeking funding to make it into a viable social enterprise.\n4\nSouthend Pier is world famous, but could be so much more. We will put out a public consultation to residents for their ideas what they would like to see at the end of the Pier. We believe it should be the Eiffel Tower of the UK and should be met with the same ambition as the people that first imagined it in the first place.\n5\nWe will reduce the price of The Pier for local people.\n6\nWe will oppose the £10m of reserve money to be ‘invested’ in Seaway, a project that Turnstone – the developers themselves – are now unwilling to invest in.\n7\nThe Kursaal require immediate and effective solutions as soon as possible. However, to avoid such failings in the future we would introduce break-clauses in contracts for sites that are deemed important to the City.\n8\nWe recognise that tax payer’s money is just that: it does not belong to a political party or a politician. Tax belongs to each person that has contributed into paying into the collective pot, and should be respected as such. We recognise that public waste is deeply off-putting for people to want to pay more tax, and so we would look to make taxation transparent for the public in a format that is easily accessible, understandable and where justification for expenditure can be made.\n9\nWe would be in favour of any future expansion of London Southend City airport. However, residents must be consulted every step of the way.\n10\nWe will introduce a new city-wide discount card for Southend residents.\n11\nWe will oppose increases in council fees and charges.\n12\nWe do not feel that dividing the city into 8 districts, with fines of £35 to £70 for driving through each one, is the correct way to manage traffic flow within the city of Southend.\n13\nWe support the use of cash and card as a method of payment.\n14\nWe support the devolution of powers from central government to a new 'Combined Authority' of Essex, Thurrock and Southend, depending on the detail of the deal, which would include Southend retaining all of its current powers.\n15\nWe support a review of the Executive team’s remuneration with a view to reduce or freeze their pay. A 10% cut would save £200K and would enable dementia services to continue as they are. It would also act as a symbolic move that may restore faith back into our leadership.\n16\nWe pledge to support implementing voluntary remuneration reviews for all staff above £50K. A 10% cut, for example, would save vast sums that may help to keep the libraries open.\n17\nWe support reducing the remuneration packages of all new council employees once the post has been left vacant.\n18\nWe would support a City of Culture bid.\n19\nWe will re-evaluate the partners SBC have chosen to work with.\n20\nWe will support and facilitate a new ‘Southend Innovation’ hub that seeks to leverage the infrastructure that is already in place; bring new investment into the city; and provide quality new jobs in for residents of Southend and the local area.\nCouncils need to be financially rewarded for growing local business, jobs and wealth, and we would do this by advocating for them to keep 100% of business rates. We would also empower them to reduce business rates for start-ups.\nWe would aim to reduce VAT according to what is affordable.\nWe would increase the personal allowance to £18K.\nEnvironment\n\"We need to protect our waters and green spaces\".\nWe believe that a sustainable environment must form the foundation of all decision-making, and we seek to create a clean environment, clean air and clean waters.\n21\nSouthend’s sea is one of our most precious assets, and yet during off-peak months water and sewage companies are allowed to pump sewage discharges from storm overflows. Would would seek regulation to make this illegal. Ideally, Southend needs a whole new sewage system that is fit for purpose.\nWe would also seek to protect all of our remaining green spaces from anymore development.\n22\nWe would support a communications drive to educate and encourage Southend citizens and businesses to re-cycle their waste, with an ambitious but very achievable aim to rapidly increase re-cycle rates from 45% to 90% by the end of 2025.\n23\nWe will re-introduce permissions to allow barbecues on the beach, but with a set of guidelines that may include all or some of the following: permitted after 6pm; only re-useable BBQs allowed; must be raised above the stones; cold water must be poured over when finished; and disposal on coals in a yellow basket provided when finished.\n24\nWe are against the taxation of older vehicles. We believe in striving for clean air in Southend, but we do not believe in penalising those that can least afford it.\n25\nWe are against the installation of 5G masts in residential areas.\n26\nWe are against future developments on flood plains.\n27\nWe support the requirement of any contracts for developers to include a clause to include: ‘if you break, pay for it’.\n28\nWhere Southend holds a direct interest in a development (e.g. The Kursaal), we support a set percentage of the development to be completed, reviewed case-by-case, in a specified period of time. We would also ensure all developers are required to have secured 100% of the funding.\n29\nWe will oppose tree-felling where it is possible to do so.\n30\nWe support dogs to be allowed on designated sections of the beach at specified times, outside peak times of the day, all year round.\nHealth & Well-being\n\"We need to bring back civic pride\".\nWe believe we are all entitled to live long and healthy lives through free access to health and social care.\nThe ultimate aim is for zero waiting times for quality diagnosis and treatment whilst doing everything possible to prevent the issues in the first place. For this we would need to quadruple capacity in Southend Hospital and our GP surgeries, which at this time is unrealistic given that today’s challenge is merely to keep the services we already have. As a party that is only made up of Southend residents, we stand the most to gain by fighting for an expansion of our capacity, which is what we would intend to do.\n31\nWe will introduce the ‘Southend Civic Pride Volunteering Partnership’ that would bring together people who wish to bring their talents wherever the need is greatest.\nWe believe that we can do it ourselves, which means serving each other above and beyond the funds of the council.\nWe want to link those people that are willing to give up their time to help others with those that are in need of that help through a shared skills community website and app. For example, a student who needs help with maths can put in their request and match with a Southend resident willing to teach them for free.\nThe basis of this scheme would not be to encroach on otherwise paid positions, rather fill the gaps that would never be able to be filled. We would look to utilise the skills, talent, knowledge and experience of newly qualified young people; retired seniors with still so much to give; as well as those that still work and who can spare a few hours of their expertise. Our end goal would be for every resident to volunteer one hour a week to surpass a million hours a year. Just think what Southend may look like with those extra resources!\nWe would look to re-establish a sense of civic pride by:\n-\nImproving the general environment and the management of street signage, park fences, pavements, litter and debris.\n-\nPromoting local history and telling the great stories of local people that could inspire all generations. We would display our history across the city in celebration of our greatest people through art, architecture, monuments and literature.\n-\nWe would celebrate our culture with annual festivals and award ceremonies.\n-\nWe would bring to the fore aspirational figures such as outstanding nurses, doctors, teachers, police officers, fire fighters, care workers, musicians, sport people, builders, entrepreneurs, volunteers, and architects across the City.\n-\nWe would pro-actively support, encourage and promote Southend sports teams, such as Southend United, in a way that would foster a greater sense of community for all the People of Southend.\n-\nRe-introduce school children visiting the Civic Centre, view Southend Council meetings and meet Councillors, and teach them how the political system works so they can take an active interest.\n32\nWe will re-build the Southend Cricket Pavilion.\n33\nWe would significantly increase the number of bike racks across the city where cyclists could feel confident their bikes are safe.\n34\nWe would invest in outdoor gyms in all parks, where suitable to improve health and well-being.\n35\nWe will support bringing back the iconic seafront illuminations. These were an attraction in themselves and would enhance the experience for residence and visitors\n36\nWe will not introduce parking charges in our parks.\n37\nWe will uphold the legal obligations and human rights for residents who are classified with special education needs and disabilities.\n38\nWe would support local employers in becoming qualified in mental health first aid.\n39\nWe will support the continuation of the Leigh Community Centre.\n40\nWe will retain all 12 Dementia Navigators positions.\n41\nWe will retain the family centre in St Luke’s.\n42\nWe will keep all the libraries that are in Southend open, ensuring they are evolving and being modernised.\n*The Dementia Navigators and family centre would be paid for by reducing the budget amendment reduction of high street parking from 11% to the required figure e.g. 2% to 5%.\nWe would retain the triple lock.\nProtection\n\"We need to bring back bobbies on the beat\".\nIdeally, would deploy the right number of police where needed, whilst doing everything possible to reduce criminal activity in the first place. In reality, the money is unavailable, so we must turn to the voluntary schemes exist already. This really is a case of going out to Southend and asking for a hundred people that would like to be fully trained in the police to protect their fellow citizens.\nWe know where the hotspots are and a constant presence of the same set of ‘bobbies on the beat’ would change thousands of residents’ lives overnight.\nWe believe those who break the law ought to face the necessary consequences, however, we would look to create a prison system that seeks to rehabilitate, change mind-sets, and offer job opportunities in order to reduce re-offending. Re-opening youth clubs would be a good start.\nWe believe in ending the era of unnecessary surveillance under the pretext of protection.\nWe believe that helping other countries in diplomacy and bridging differences, rather than supporting and contributing to the escalation of war, will reduce the likelihood of acts of revenge on the UK. Our sympathy extends to all innocent victims in all wars across the world, and we would back any UK leadership that focuses on bringing peace. It should go without saying that the criminals who have broken international law should be found, arrested and tried in a court of law.\n43\nWe will support bringing back ‘bobbies on the beat’, who would walk the same areas and get to know residents by name.\n44\nWe will support a satellite police station in Southend High Street.\n45\nWe will re-ignite the Special Constabulary scheme. It is a much under-publicised role that allows people to volunteer 16 hours of their time per month, where they are trained and have the same powers as regular Police Officers.\n46\nWe will re-start the Community Safety scheme where employers can fund select members of their workforce to join the wider police community.\n47\nWe will ban electric scooters on public pavements. We would also educate and inform residents of the legalities of electric scooters.\n48\nWe will look to re-open youth centres across Southend in order to reduce crime and provide a safe space where young people can occupy their time in an enjoyable and productive way, broaden their education, and gain easy access to mental health services.\n49\nWe will invest in extra security cameras and police resources in known crime hotspots for anti-social behaviour.\nHousing\n\"We need to ensure our infrastructure and services can sustain new developments\".\n50\nWe would work in partnership with Southend Homeless Action Network (SHAN) to put in place long-term strategies to end homelessness.\n51\nWe believe in the development of Queensway, but we will look to re-start the process with a more financially viable scheme.\n52\nWe will oppose increasing council rents.\n53\nWe support the enforcement of the affordable housing quota on property developers.\n54\nIt is accepted that planning applications have to be considered on their own merits, however, we would pursue planning and regulation that whenever a new development is being considered, provision of the necessary infrastructure must be included as part of it.\nTransport, Roads, Pavements and Parking\n\"We will bring in parking charges that support residents, business and visitors\".\n55\nFor any future plans regarding Queensway, we will be against filling in the road as it will create gridlock and cut off the businesses on Southchurch Road and Sutton Road.\n56\nWe will oppose charging for parking along the entire seafront from 6pm onwards.\n57\nWe would introduce 1-hour free parking, similar to Leigh, around Southend High Street.\n58\nWe are against closing car parks if it results in visitors causing congestion in residential parking nearby.\n59\nWe would oppose the introduction of cashless-only parking meters, and ensure they are all able to take both cash and card.\n60\nWe would launch a review of the cycle lanes on the seafront to enhance their safety.\n61\nWe would support fixing potholes across the City.\n62\nWe would support speed cameras in identified speeding hotspots in order to prevent accidents before they happen.\n63\nWe would support speed reductions in certain areas including 20 miles per hour zones – but only if residents from each road have collectively agreed.\n64\nWe are against pavements constantly being dug up by different companies carrying out works, then left looking in a poor state. Therefore, we would add a clause into the contracts for all companies who wish to work on our pavements to ensure all works are finished to a high quality that does not negatively impact the look of the area.\n65\nWe are against the disruption caused by multiple road closures at the same time due to infrastructure works, and will examine the current planning process with the objective of encouraging better coordination, including work that is carried out during the night.\n66\nWe will continue to campaign against the closures of ticket offices at train stations should the need arise.\n67\nWe would expand parking for motorcycles.\n68\nWe will look at how the shared space along ‘City Beach’ and the High Street can be made safer for both pedestrians and cyclists.\nSOUTHEND CONFELICITY MANIFESTO 2024\nEducation\n\"We need to connect education to careers in Southend\".\nWe believe in an education system underpinned by the belief that it should develop a person’s deep understanding of the world; encourages a love of learning; has intrinsic value to oneself and the community; and that it is a life-long endeavour.\nWe believe in an education system that trains our youth in ways that will directly contribute to the prosperity of themselves and society.\nWe will seek to create a true connection between education and careers, and ultimately create work opportunities where people can make a living doing what they love.\n69\nWe believe that everyone should have the opportunity to fulfil their potential through free education whether practical or academic, all the way through to PhD level education or professional apprenticeships.\n70\nWe believe in an education system where children receive the attention they need to flourish, whilst enjoying the social interactions of classmates. Therefore, our ideal aim is to reduce school class sizes to 12 children per teacher and Learning Assistant, and ensure all teachers are qualified. We fully appreciate this is wholly unrealistic, however, we would work towards this goal.\nThank you for taking the time to read our Southend manifesto.

  "https_www_southendconfelicityparty_co_uk_/https_www_southendconfelicityparty_co_uk_post_confusion-over-whether-southend-is-to-become-a-smart-city/content_3.html": "Confusion over whether Southend is to become a SMART City, as Southend Council Leader states it is not in planning or implementation despite information to the contrary\n- James Miller\n- Feb 1\n- 10 min read\nUpdated: Feb 2\nIt was reported in the Echo that the so-called and rarely heard of ‘Internet of Things’ would require 36ft masts to be erected all over Southend.\nThere are many who cite serious health concerns generated from the masts pointing to much evidence from various sources.\nGiven the now well publicised health issues associated with the COVID vaccinations and other health catastrophes over the decades, it would be irresponsible to dismiss concerns over the masts out of hand.\nThere is not a scientist in the world who knows the long term effects (say 30 years as a point of reference) of placing numerous masts in residential areas because time hasn’t got there yet. I don’t know how an experiment like this could possibly be conducted safely, but my preference would be for live tests involving human subjects better to be avoided. I have not conducted enough research, but if there already is data that proves their safety then that would be one part of the argument settled.\nHowever, it is a little worrying when the government website states:\n‘It is possible that there may be a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area. However, the overall exposure is expected to remain low relative to guidelines and, as such, there should be no consequences for public health.’\nI took the time to underline the above words to really emphasise that ‘possible’, ‘may’, ‘small’, ‘expected’ and ‘should’ does not equate to definitely!\nIn any case a simpler argument is their aesthetics. They look a little like something from Lord of the Rings and I dare say they wouldn’t do much to enhance value of property nor the view outside the home. Some have said just look outside and you will see lampposts, traffic lights, etc, so what’s the difference? To those I suggest you volunteer your houses - one volunteer is better than ten pressed men, or so the saying goes!\nNot for me though. I simply don’t want them outside my house and if I don’t, then why should anyone else be forced to suffer? Particularly without any consultation.\nI wonder how many councillors or politicians should be so civic minded and volunteer their properties for a set of lovely 36ft masts outside their homes?!\nAs a reasonable step, the Southend Confelicity Party voted that if these masts are to be installed, they are done so away from residential areas at the very least to reduce any potential health issue and avoid ruining the ambience of our town.\nTo the Rescue\nDespite a number of masts already up before any resident could say otherwise, after the news broke that another 27 would he going up around Chalkwell and Westcliff, swift online protests saw Southend Labour announce no more masts would go ahead - where possible. Instead the Internet of things would work within current infrastructure.\nHow they accomplished this I don’t know, but if we are to accept this at face value, credit is due here for those involved.\nI would only ungratefully ask why this solution was not sought in the first place? And the ‘where possible’ leaves the situation very open, meaning we could still get the 27 masts around Chalkwell, Westcliff and anywhere else.\nThe Echo’s publication of the masts also highlighted perhaps an even bigger issue.\nThe SMART City\nI am no expert in what it is and the end goal, but it essentially boils down to the city putting sensors across the whole of Southend to capture residents’ data in order to run more efficiently.\nI have for some time become quite wary of the capture of our personal data and the obvious dangers that poses, so I asked two questions at the Full Council meeting to find out more information.\n13. Question from Mr Miller to the Leader of the Council (Cllr Cowan)\nThe SMART City is not something I have heard many Southend residents ask for - in fact I haven’t heard a single resident mention it. However, rumour has it that we are getting it anyway.\nOne of the many unknowingly wanted benefits is ensuring we will know when the bins need emptying, but this can only work with access to Southend residents’ data.\nI don’t know anyone as yet who would like more of their data shared with government, so can you specify what data will be extracted, how it will be extracted, how it will be used and what advantages there will be aside from emptying our bins?\nAnswer from Cllr Cowan\nThere is no SMART City in planning or application.\nThe council is not proposing new technology requiring us to gather resident data.\nSouthend is a member of South Essex Councils who are implementing a low power radio wave network (that is not dissimilar to home WiFinetworks), known as LoRaWAN, across the city and region to facilitate the collection of data from sensors. These sensors send tiny packets of data such as alerts to warn of possible flooding, air quality alerts, traffic flows, with the intention of improving services for residents.\nAny reference to sensors in bins relates to public street bins for example, not residential bins, and the data would alert our waste contractor if a bin needs emptying sooner than scheduled, helping our city to stay clean, assuming that this technology is utilitised for this purpose, which it currently is not. I can assure you that the LoRaWAN network is unable to manage large packets of data such as resident data, videos, or audio and that the Council are not putting sensors in residents’ bins.\nQuestion 14. Question from Mr Miller to the Leader of the Council (Cllr Cowan)\nQuestion\nHow much money in total will the implementation of the SMART City, from start to finish, cost the Southend taxpayer and what avenues are there to stop it if residents do not want it?\nAnswer from Cllr Cowan\nThere is no ‘smart city’ in planning or in implementation.\nLet’s break this down…\nWith my two questions up it seemed my fears had been allayed - there was no SMART City for Southend.\nYet the Echo article specifically says: ‘Southend Council is signed up to the national Smart City scheme.’\nChristine Sexton, journalist of the report, is normally so accurate, astute and on the money when it comes to bringing us news of what our council have been up to, so what could have possibly gone wrong this time?\nI decided to spend quite an arduous four seconds typing into Google ‘SMART City Southend’ - just to check the Leader of Southend Council, Southend Labour and possibly even Mayor of Essex one day, would not lie in an official, on the record, public meeting.\nTo my surprise Southend had indeed signed up to become a SMART City only a few years ago, albeit not on his watch, and so it seems the Echo can be exonerated!\nWhether it was a lie or he was mis-informed by council officers, sure enough at the top of the search was the council document outlining recommendations from the Chief Executive [of Southend Council] to Cabinet to proceed with the planning and implementation of Southend becoming a SMART City.\nI would urge you to read the report (see link below) and discover for yourself the broad outline of the SMART City - no one’s hiding here.\nReport to cabinet from 2018:\nBriefly, the report explains exactly what a SMART City is and why it would be good for Southend, and uses the exact term the ‘Internet of Things’.\nAn excerpt of the report from the Chief Executive to the Cabinet is as follows:\n‘The Council’s ‘Digital Strategy 2017/20’ including the foundation for its SMART Cities journey was approved by Cabinet in 2017.\n‘The document itself contains both routine business as usual tasks as well as longer term strategic actions but, crucially, laid down the intention to create the foundations for the development of Southend as a SMART City.’\nPerhaps things have changed, but the same language is being used now, the only out I can give Cllr Cowan is if they have dropped the term SMART City.\nYet it doesn’t look like it.\nAccording to the Local Government Association (LGA), who in their Corporate Peer Challenge of Southend Council report are quoted as saying ‘The council’s SMART strategy for Digital and Technology (2021-2024) presents the overall strategic direction for digitalisation and use of technology with the aim of supporting Southend’s journey to becoming a Smart City.’ (https://www.local.gov.uk/lga-corporate-peer-challenge-southend-sea-city-council)\nEither way, to pronounce Cllr Cowan as a liar was not my intended purpose nor am I doing so - I had already assumed Southend was intended to be a SMART City just based on the integrity of the excellent and longstanding Echo journalist - it just so happens that as it stands, it appears that way. On this I look forward to giving him the opportunity to clarify his answers.\nMy major point is that a SMART City is not something I would put my name to, primarily because the success of the scheme relies on putting sensors everywhere ‘to collect data from citizens, devices, buildings and cameras’, for what we really don’t really know.\nAll we have at the moment are a few very broad and loose explanations as to the benefits, such as those Cllr Cowan highlighted in his answers such as flood defence, air quality, traffic management and emptying bins.\nFlooding\nWe already receive flooding alerts, weather reports and worst case enjoy the luxury of the transparency of our windows! When it rains we know there is a risk. When it rains really hard, the risk is increased. I know I am making this sound simple, but I ask in innocence and ignorance, what more do we need to know?\nI do also wonder how installing sensors to warn us of flood alerts is consistent with the council approving housing developments on flood plains such as Bellway in Shoebury.\nAir Quality\nWe already receive plenty of information when hayfever is about - a runny nose and itchy eyes are probably as smart an indicator as any!\nWe already know that driving a car during rush hour is likely to reduce air quality. My concern is what this Labour council will do once it can play the numbers game. Ban driving at certain times? Put a tax on certain roads at certain times? Are we going hear justifications for Low Traffic Neighbourhoods? Or even the dreaded ULEZ?\nTraffic Management\nRegarding traffic management, the Map app on all our phones provides adequate information on any build up of traffic, and most residents already know when traffic is at its busiest: before and after work!\nEmptying Bins\nThere was a certain condescension with Cllr Cowan’s answer when he says ‘we’re not going to be putting sensors in residents’ bins’, but to be fair my question had a tinge of underhanded sarcasm, so touché!\nI must say that alerting the waste companies of full bins seems a might heavy handed and expensive especially since they will definitely not respond.\nAs it is, Southend Labour’s policy to introduce the reduction of bin collections to fortnightly was apparently because we couldn’t afford it, which means either the waste companies will empty our bins once alerted for free or they ain’t coming!\nAll these reasons do not really make any sense.\nPresuming there were good reasons, it would have been acceptable for the public to have been informed what those were a while ago, otherwise you get people like me writing off what may be perfectly safe and useful technology, and pointing towards issues such as the serious invasion of our privacy.\nGovernment Monitoring\nThe SMART City will take the invasion of our privacy just another step further until every aspect of our lives are digitalised and monitored.\nRight now, the dubious reasons for this technology do not necessarily impede on our individual personal data, more on a broad collective level of our activities. However, once the sensors are in anything is possible.\nThe question is do you want your data collected from everything you do? Do you want your data collected by people who you do not necessarily trust? Do you trust what the politicians are going to do with your data?\nThe people who say, ‘well they monitor us anyway, so what does it matter?’ I say that is what has gotten us into the mess we are in now.\nJust look at the violations of our privacy:\nWe cannot walk almost anywhere in public without our images being captured on CCTV.\nTo get through airports you have to give up your fingerprints or image just to get through the gate.\nEvery website you have ever visited is now on record.\nEvery social media post is saved.\nEvery TV channel you watch is known.\nTurn your heating on, they know how warm you like your house.\nRead a book digitally and they know what you’re reading.\nElectric cars know everywhere you ever go.\nGoogle earth can literally zoom into exactly where you are at any given time.\nPhones are listening to everything you are saying wherever you are saying it.\nBanks already know what you spend, but when digital currency comes in every penny you ever spend will be known.\nSouthend have brought in Facial Recognition Technology for the police to log every face it sees. At the moment only those who commit ‘high crime’ will be saved but how long before litter picking puts your face on this database?\nAll this is a wild abuse of power and of personal freedom. We have been boiling frogs for decades, but the majority of us are actively willing for this to continue. My favourite is when I hear people say ‘if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear’. Scary stuff!\nThe thin end of the wedge was the decision taken to allow personal data to be used as an organisation wished. Laws surrounding data protection have since followed, but this should have been the case in the first place and regulation is nowhere near good enough as it stands. Terms & Conditions are very rarely read, but often if you choose not to sign them, access to their services will not be possible.\nPersonal data should be sacrosanct, but has become a commodity to be traded.\nWhat does it all mean?\nMasts should never have gone up without the permission of residents.\nResidents should have been informed of all the scientific data that proves they are safe long term.\nSouthend residents should have been consulted about becoming a SMART City, if according to Cllr Cowan, we aren’t already.\nFor me, the benefits do not appear worth it all and I would invest the money in something useful; perhaps a doctors surgery or an expansion of our hospital, thinking inside the box.\nThe sensors dotted across the city to make this technology work I have deep reservations about, and I certainly am not willing to have yet another avenue of monitoring forced upon us.\nEven if it was free I wouldn’t do it based on Cllr Cowan’s answers, and yet we still don’t know the cost because apparently it is not happening! If it costs the council £75K to re-do some signs in Belfairs park I shudder to guess how many £millions this will end up as.\nThis represents a fundamental change in how our city is run and yet again there has been next to no public consultation. The only reason I knew was because of the Echo article, which according to our Leader is wrong.\nI remain confused as to whether Southend is to become a SMART City or not and look forward to hearing the truth once it has finally been established.\nReferences",

How Southend is to be swallowed up by so-called devolution\n- James Miller\n- Jan 21\n- 11 min read\nUpdated: Jan 23\nThe Council Meeting\nWednesday, 8th January 2025 at 6:30pm\nThis blog is a review of the council meeting regarding devolution and explores councillors’ views and my take on it all, including commentary on the government’s white paper on English devolution.\nAs leader of a party founded on the promotion of local people having more money, power, resources and influence, the concept of ‘devolution’ should tie perfectly into what Confelicity does. Therefore, it might be assumed we would unanimously be in favour of the transfer of these things from Westminster/Whitehall.\nThe transference of all this would be most welcome, however, I could not disagree more with how it is coming about and where the chips are falling.\nDemocracy, for one thing, seems to have evaporated! Although the government white paper suggests a public consultation in March 2025, this is to be lead by central government and is not about whether we’d like devolution, it’s just a tick box exercise in how residents might see it emerge.\nCouncillors at this meeting recognised the ‘seismic’ change to local government and one that hasn’t been seen for over 50 years. So why are residents not being asked about any of this? Labour will say it was in the manifesto (and it was started by the Tories) and to this I say that’s not good enough. Manifestos are like Terms & Conditions - very few read them!\nThat is not to say it wasn’t spoken about before now. I attended a very informative Essex Chambers of Commerce event quite a while back that had representatives explaining all about it.\nAt the time I was informed there were three types of Combined Authority with one option centred upon an elected Mayor. There was a delay in moving things forward and I hadn’t heard anything until it had reared its head only now.\nShortly after the Chambers event I took the subject of devolution to one of our Confelicity manifesto meetings and we ended up voting unanimously in favour in principle depending on the detail.\nWell, even after reading the 112 page white paper on Devolution in England, the report from the Southend Executive Director for Strategy and Change, the Cabinet report and the letter from the Secretary of State, the detail remained difficult to decipher as to what it meant for Southend! However, I have gleaned enough detail to know I am against it at this point in time for a number of reasons.\nFrom 180,000 to 500,000\nFirstly, Labour will be looking for authorities to have 500,000 constituents as a minimum, which means Southend Council will have to merge with other councils such as Rochford and Castle Point, at the very least, but still further to make the numbers.\nAccording to Labour, ‘devolution enables more decisions to be made by those who know their areas best’, but can someone who lives on the edge Castle Point really know the issues in Shoeburyness?\nI was previously told that a new Combined Authority would not impact Southend Council in any way and we would remain exactly as we are. The new Combined Authority would only be taking powers of central government and would have its own remit. It was not made clear that Southend would be completely changed as an entity.\nMayors\nSecondly, I was told we would not have a Mayor. However, the report states the whole scheme is centred on having an elected Mayor as early as 2026.\nSaddiq Khan alone is enough to frighten me off!\nIf we get the wrong person we too could end up with ULEZ, 20mph speed limits across the whole of Southend and a self-promoting New Years firework display paid for by taxpayers but credited to the Mayor of Essex!\nOne of my personal political fights is building on greenbelt land, and Mayors will have much greater control over housing as they will be responsible for ‘strategically planning housing growth’, according to the white paper.\nThat for me is ominous and I foresee uproar across Essex as more and more greenbelt land turns to concrete.\nThe Mayor will also be ‘a fundamental partner in delivering the government’s missions’, one of them happening to be the digging up of the greenbelt (https://www.southendconfelicityparty.co.uk/post/labour-southend-council-leader-supports-building-by-bournes-green-chase-in-line-with-national-labour).\nThe Council of Nations and Regions, lead by the Prime Minister no less, will collaborate on ‘national missions’ while the Mayoral Council, lead by the Deputy Prime Minister, will bring together the English Mayors and perform a similar task. The white paper uses the term ‘hardwired’ through the Council of Nations, and you can see that the Mayor will, in many ways, act as a tool in which the national government will carry out its directives. I suppose it’s easier than democracy!\nAs one councillor pointed out, there is also the very serious issue of corruption (though that is always open to any position). Unfortunately, history shows people cannot handle too much power. It’s why we diluted the leader’s power in Confelicity. The amount of powers that are to go to the Mayor is way beyond that which one person should be gifted with, and that’s not even accounting for the very few people that could be capable of doing a job like that.\nYou won’t believe just what knowledge and experience is required in housing and education to the environment and transport. And bear in mind the Mayor will be an elected position, and as we know politicians are not professionals in the work sense. Can you imagine some of our current council leaders presiding over all this?!\nMoney, Resources and Power\nDevolution will not mean Southend itself will necessarily receive more money, power and resources.\nSure, the people who sit on the newly formed council will, as they will cover a much large geographic area, reign over more resources, and I’m going to guess, be paid significantly more. An enviable position for those who stand to benefit.\nI suppose from the perspective of Southend Council Leader Cllr Cowan and many other career politicians who are in favour, he has as good a shot at becoming Mayor as anyone, particularly as the Leader of the Council - on paper he has a decent CV. It presents a bigger domain in which to rule and someone of his ambition would not turn his nose up at the opportunity. And yet, with the greatest of respect, he is exactly the reason the role of Mayor and all those powers are so dangerous.\nAs Leader of the Confelicity Party it has occurred to me that I, myself, might wish to run as Mayor of Essex and would benefit Confelicity as our coverage would publicise our local movement faster than we could otherwise have hoped. Yet, it wouldn’t be the right thing for Southend. The person on the street will have a much longer path to change or address anything as we skyrocket from 180,000 people to 500,000, and once the extra £billions is diluted into the new population I wonder just much extra that will be per person.\nWhat was the vote for Southend Council about?\nMuch progress seems to have been made behind the scenes since my induction into Devolution from the Essex Chambers event because the vote at this meeting wasn’t about whether we’d like devolution. It seems that decision had been taken long ago which councillors seemed very aware of and with good reason. The white paper speaks as though it is a done deal with many passages that talk as though it is.\nInstead the vote was whether we would write to the government to say we want to put ourselves forward to be at the front of the queue for the devolution programme.\nCllr Cox, Reform Leader, asked whether the meeting was structurally the same as a scrutiny meeting and whether questions could be asked. Unfortunately, the Monitoring Officer confirmed it would be a standard council meeting that allowed for comments only and then a vote taken. I cannot believe how such a monumental change can pass without any official scrutiny. I agree with Green councillor Allen who said it was “top down government”.\nThe vote was 36 - 7 in favour to put ourselves at the front of the queue, and with Essex and Thurrock recently voting the same way we are now all in position.\nSuch coordination from all these councils makes me deeply suspicious and someone behind the scenes has been very clever about the way they have gone about this. All three councils had to agree by the January 10th deadline and did it with ease.\nLocal Election Cancellations\nThe only real opposition was about the cancellation of the local elections in 2025 where Labour had generously and with much foresight legislated to allow councils to skip them if needed. It’s amazing what the law can do when you need it. It should also be noted that this acts as confirmation the cancellation was premeditated.\nThere are many who say they will rightly be cancelled as it would be a waste of money. However, I believe this to be an appalling level of arrogance towards our democratic rights and elections must take place.\nI realise Southend wasn’t going to go to the polls in 2025 as it is a fallow year, but the rest of Essex was ready.\nLabour would have lost a ton of seats as their calamities far outweigh some of the good stuff. Due to this, the optics very much look like devolution is a convenient excuse and if Labour did wish to sneak devolution home they would be better advised not to converge the obstruction of democracy with devolution. Not great foundations to build trust for the new way of governing.\nCouncillors Against\nThere were common sense councillors who wanted proper consultation with residents and real debate.\nCllr Allen, Greens, said “we’re being asked to sign off major structural changes without the plans and details in place”. Cllr Longstaff, Greens Leader, said “I cannot commit to something so vague that risks destabilising and the wider region.”\nNon-aligned Independent Cllr Murphy said she didn’t want us to be a “test case”. Cllr McMahan (Conservative) said “we would do well to wait”. While Cllr Davison (Conservative) said “if we do things in too much haste it doesn’t often lead to the best of outcomes.”\nOnly a few voices with the conviction of their principles, but enough to keep some semblance of faith at least.\nIt’s Happening Anyway so…\nUnfortunately, their voices were few and far between. Most repeated the lines:\n“It’s happening whether we like it or not”,\n“We’re going to do it anyway”,\nand “We’ve got to play the hand we’ve been dealt” .\nI do not believe in that defeatist philosophy.\nIf we don’t like something then say so and vote so, like the seven.\nI was disappointed to hear former Southend Labour leader and Leader of the Council, Cllr Gilbert, say he didn’t believe it was right, but “it’s clear all the major parties think it is a good idea and the decision seems inevitable, so it’s best we take this opportunity rather than further procrastination.”\nI’m just not sure that’s the right attitude to take, but it’s a difficult position to be in when you’re also part of the Labour MP’s office whose government are bulldozing it through.\nCllr Collins, Lib Dem Leader, also didn’t like the idea before but will go with it.\nI can see why they might succumb to this view as the white paper states the government will go through the legislative process ‘when it becomes necessary to ensure progress’. It literally states the terms ‘ministerial directive’ What words! This is clearly the new term for dictatorship and a worrying tone for the future if this is how it is going to be. The government expects to deliver new unitary authorities by April 2027 and April 2028.\nMy view is nothing is set is stone no matter who says it is and how convincing they are. If the whole of Southend, Rochford, Castle Point and Essex really didn’t want to move forward with it, no matter what the government thinks it can do, it won’t be able to.\nHaving said all that, I feel certain anti-devolution protests are far from the mood of general public and why would they be? People are occupied with their own lives and few have spent their time studying the political structures of Southend council, much less understand a political re-structuring that even the most informed are sketchy on.\nThe general consensus of councillors was they preferred the idea of having a seat at the table in deciding how devolution looks. To that I say where is the guarantee? How much say will we get? This very meeting councillors attended underlined that being at the table doesn't really mean anything if the cards are stacked. Cabinet had the power to ignore the comments completely, and as Cllr Courtney, Conservative Leader, pointed out, “the letter was probably already written!”\nJust as a cherry on top of what was a dubious meeting with many seemingly picked off,\nLabour Councillor Faulkner-Hatt, one of the defeatists, happened also to mention her conversations with the Southend Youth Council who supposedly said they support it, even going on to say they believe having direct communication rather than a lot of bureaucracy would be so much more productive! Hmm, words in mouth sprint to mind, if indeed they ever did spring from them.\nOverview from Leader of the Southend Council\nCurrent Leader of Southend council and Southend Labour Leader closed the ‘debate’ with comments that I have answered beneath:\n“Devolution is about bringing powers down.”\nHad it been straight to Southend then fantastic. It’s not, so it is not.\n“Government intends that 100% of England will be devolved.”\nThe very fact there are local governments across the country with certain levels of money, power and resources means ‘devolution’ already exists in some form. Also, just because government, now, wants this, doesn’t mean governments will for the future. And if Labour carry on as they are, they won’t be the government!\n“Wait at the back of the queue and risk ending up with a form of devolution that doesn’t suit our residents and scraping the barrel for what’s left.”\nWhat does this even mean? It certainly doesn’t mention this kind of punishment in the white paper, therefore this is a false statement and equates to little more than low level salesmanship.\n“Crucial to engage including local communities to ensure their voices are heard.”\nThe irony of empowering local residents through devolution without consulting with the public seems to be lost on him. To engage after the event is meaningless.\n“Advocate for retaining our identity.”\nDoes he realise that is not a choice? And if it were, are we to be grateful?\nWhat Does it all Mean?\nI am proud of the seven councillors that voted against putting Southend first in the queue. Far too many unknowns before jumping ahead with this.\nI am not against devolution in principle - Confelicity voted in favour depending on the detail. However, I am aghast of how it has come about, the lack of transparency, democracy and detail, and the type of devolution we may be getting.\nThe government white paper on English Devolution does not make it clear what it means for Southend. What I have noticed is the total lack of balance - everything about devolution is great and there are no downsides.\nI detest the amount of power Mayors will receive and worry about the competence of those who take those positions. I am also struggling with the illusion of empowerment when the Prime Minister will chair meetings to personally push through the government’s agenda.\nLabour’s intent to draw the population line at 500,000 people per authority renders empowering local people obsolete. I believe their understanding of what local means is very different to reality. This decision is the epicentre of why this form of devolution is bad for Southend and the other authorities that are clumped together. We don’t know what it is like to live there and vice versa. This is not local.\nI would much rather we stay as we are with each authority simply given more money, power, resources, and certainly not worry about a Mayor unless it continues in a ceremonial role.\nConservative MP Mark Francois made a good speech in the House of Commons, but has called for a referendum. I don’t believe there is a need, it just had to go through local councils to vote on. If this was the case I doubt many would have voted for it. Perhaps that’s why Labour chose this undemocratic method.\nI would have liked to have asked a great many questions! How much money will we get? How many councillors will there be? How will the boundaries change? Southend’s agenda is already packed, how will adding another two to five authorities help with this?\nI have a hundred more questions that I do feel would have been rather helpful to have been given the opportunity to ask. And the same courtesy shown to every resident who would be affected.\nI remember starting Confelicity in part to ‘stop stupid’, but at this stage I’ll take a ‘slow down’ given how far along the road we seem to be. It seems we may well be too late on this occasion, but unlike many of our local politicians, we will not simply accept our fate.\nAppendices\nReport of Executive Director (Strategy and Change)\nCabinet Report\nEnglish Devolution White Paper\nLetter from the Secretary of State",

Regardless of just how bad the national Tories have behaved over recent years, they would still be in or close to power today were it not for the hypnosis he has had over millions of voters across the UK.\nIn Southend West in 2019, Labour’s Aston Line secured 13,000 votes and lost by almost 14,000 to David Amess.\nIn 2024, his Labour colleague, David Burton-Sampson, in the same seat, won 16,000 votes, but this time beat Anna Firth by around 2,000. The difference: only the 8,000 or so votes Reform picked up!\nThe same was true in Southend East. Labour’s Bayo Alaba picked up only 700 more votes than Labour secured in 2019, but was the victor after the non-existent and disowned Reform candidate picked up over 7,000 votes without even stepping foot in Southend.\nWhilst I wholeheartedly congratulate our new Labour MPs to Southend and believe they will give our city their best, they are probably aware that their success was largely down to Farage.\nYes, they worked very hard in their respective campaigns and are good intentioned people having met them, but if ever Reform went, they would go with him - it is as simple as that.\nTheir opportunity is to show Southend what they can do and really build on the Labour vote in their own right.\nMy feeling, however, is if Farage and the debris of the Tory Party find some way to unite the right, even if David and Bayo personally escorted every last toilet paper and wet wipe out of the Thames Estuary; quadrupled capacity in Southend Hospital; fixed every pothole with their bare hands; personally mowed our overgrown grass verges and emptied our bins; put every drug dealer behind bars; turned Southend High Street into an entrepreneurial mecca; and masterminded Southend United to be crowned Premier League champions, they would still get the boot.\nThe reality is their vote barely moved from when Corbyn was in charge, and add up the Tory and Reform vote and it speaks for itself.\nWhether good or bad, Farage did this, not Starmer.\nThe Great Reform\nIf the 2019 General Election was about Brexit, this was about the right wing implosion.\nWhilst I have full respect for anyone that chooses to buy into Farage and do not begrudge or mock them for a second, I do have deep reservations about their leader.\nWhether you agree with his polices or not, and I do like a number of them, the way in which he, in the snap of his fingers, installed himself as the leader and landed himself in Clacton as the parliamentary candidate, shoving the incumbent aside, would in any other party be tantamount to a coup.\nIf we thought Sunak’s undemocratic installation as the Prime Minister was bad, this was on a whole other level.\nYet, it’s ok for him. Not only did he get away with it unnoticed, he was lauded for it.\nInternal Party Politics\nThe way a party runs internally I believe manifests itself in the outside world.\nThe Tories are in total disarray, ergo, the country is in chaos.\nLabour are a collective dictatorship and this will pervade itself as an over-bearing nanny state where we cannot be trusted with our money. This is not to offend anyone in the party, but independent thinking in my experience was not encouraged. I’m sure many in Labour would dispute this!\nReform make the rules up as they go along and they will find a way to push against anything or anyone that gets in their way. Farage strikes me as an entrepreneurial, break a few eggs, politician. For many, this will be seen as refreshing - let them tear through the bureaucracy and civil servants holding the country back. Democracy slows the process down anyway and we need a good clear out.\nHowever, the old cliche ‘be careful what you wish for’ springs to mind. Make no mistake, Reform, under Farage, is a dictatorship, we just can’t see it yet because he is so mesmerising in comparison to all the other leaders.\nDictatorships and democracy\nNot that dictatorships are fundamentally wrong in of themselves.\nIt is quite possible that one person knows how to make all the right decisions all of the time and that same one person will not succumb to the temptation of corruption. But I have my doubts.\nIt is all so tempting to believe that we, ourselves, know all the answers - that discussion and debate is hardly worth it.\nAs a leader of a political party myself, albeit a fledgling one, there are times where our super-democratic system can frustrate me.\nOur boycott of the Southend West Hustings due to our relegation into the not worth thinking about category caused immense discord, and there was a small part of me that simply wanted to make my own decision.\nBut I can tell you any time I do get voted down, upon reflection, it was worth it. Had I been slapdash and dictatorial over the short period of our existence there probably would have been some disastrous decisions on our hands! No, I love democracy more than ever and it really works well if done right.\nOur group disagree all the time, but the reason we all get along is because we are secure in the knowledge that we have the power of veto.\nThere is no need for aggression or indignation because even if the policy doesn’t become party policy, we are still free to express ourselves and vote as we wish.\nIt is fair and it is democratic.\nReform Conservatives\nFarage, on the other hand, will do whatever he wants regardless of what others in his party thinks, and he certainly couldn’t care less about what those outside the party think. It probably galvanises him.\nHe will be invigorated and energised with the election result and his first speech will see bombastic, justified and unfettered smugness, besieging the Tory’s failure. And he will go straight after Starmer’s throat to prove what effective opposition looks like.\nFor those in the gallery, this will be a boon. It will earn him ever more devotees who will salivate for more, and that’s where the trouble for the Tories really will come in.\nThey cannot control Farage. If there was another election tomorrow I believe Reform would beat the Tories quite easily. Those Tory voters who believed a Reform vote would mean a Labour government, now know a vote for Reform would have done the job.\nIt means the Tories need to do a deal pretty soonish or there really will be a problem, and inconceivably, if there is a coupling of the parties it will be on his terms - that despite the fact that he only has 5 seats!\nRules\nFor all that the Conservative Party have become, they still played within the technical rules of democracy. Farage will not. His behaviour at the European Parliament, however amusing and arguably justifiable, displayed his overt contempt. Disruption and disorder were the name of the game and he won. He single-handedly got us out of Europe, and defeating the Tories will not be difficult for him.\nIf he takes charge of the right in a few years time - call it ‘Reform Conservatives’ if you will, it will essentially become socialism versus nationalism - something we haven’t seen for a while.\nI don’t say any of this as a slight to Reform voters - I understand why he is popular. My observation is only about Farage and his behaviour toward democracy.\nTribute\nTurning to the election, I would like to pay tribute to all the candidates and supporters of all parties, Anna Firth in particular as the standing MP. Like her or not, I really felt she tried her best for Southend and put many a long shift in for our City.\nI repeat my warm welcome to our new MPs, I wish them the best of luck and look forward to working with them.\nI thank the whole of the Confelicity team for their incredible efforts. Our goal was to spread awareness about our party and I believe we are more known than yesterday.\nA local party for the national stage will return to a local party for the local stage, and we look forward to the 2026 local elections where all 51 councillors are up.",

But did our country ever leave us? Starmer has 5 years to make the case.\n- James Miller\n- Jul 20, 2024\n- 8 min read\nUpdated: Mar 20\nThe dust is starting to settle on the General Election earthquake that has seen Starmer take power on the back of Farage.\nLabour are rolling out their policies at pace and with gusto on a ‘mission driven’ mission to prove they can fulfil their missions!\nTheir manifesto appeared written by AI and I don’t say this to be derogatory - I challenge you to read it and not conclude something similar.\nThat is not to say there aren’t many positives in there, but it was so broad and vague that it was difficult to understand exactly what it is they will be doing.\nI’m not sure it matters, my feeling is that people just want some competency and decency at this point in time.\nStarmer, whilst prone to retract and u-turn, at least has the appearance of sensibleness at face value, and such is the low level of expectation we have of our national leaders, the famine of this quality makes it now a rare and precious commodity!\nOnly a glaringly poor policy that might affect the public psyche will prevent him enjoying a gentle time of it for now - unless Farage has anything to say about it. For Farage, now he is in the House of Commons, is Starmer’s real opposition and stands on an entirely different platform and one of conviction.\nI am neither for Farage or Starmer, but despite Labour’s landslide, it is Reform who are the real revolutionaries.\nFor this reason, despite my immense admiration for Farage’s political feats and indefatigable character and personal charisma, I wish to go against the grain of Farage’s exponential popularity and highlight a number of areas of concern.\nI do this because I believe, pending heinous circumstances similar to that of Trump’s unequivocally evil assassination attempt (for which Farage is out in America helping Trump with emotional support), that Farage could very well be the Leader of the Opposition after the next General Election - at the very least.\nConservative Plight\nHe has been flying the Conservative's right wing flag for decades and is ready to “give the ordinary person their country back” - whatever that means.\nWhoever the chosen one will be as the new Tory leader, only a miracle can save them now as it stands. Those who voted Tory to stop Labour could well be making their short journey to Reform and that can only mean potential annihilation.\nI am sure there will be many Conservative supporters who will say I am wrong and they will re-group and come again, but their second-coming is wholly dependent on the downfall of Farage. This is, of course, very possible, but this is not a strategy they can rely on. Electing someone with Farage’s views won’t help either because why would voters go to the diluted version?\nHowever, whilst I agree with parts of his manifesto - raising the personal allowance tax threshold to £20K is a good idea if it can be paid for - there are some serious questions to be asked with some of the pledges that appear somewhat authoritarian and highly discriminatory with his attacks on the so-called woke brigade.\nStarmer Provokes with Woke\nAs it happens, Starmer’s opening speech as Prime Minister in the House of Commons was a firework of woke - to coin a phrase that will never take off, a firewoke if you will - as he celebrated just how ‘diverse’ the new members were. From exploiting Mother of the House, Diane Abbott - who barely scraped the Labour selection panel - to becoming the world’s most LGBTQ+ parliamentary house in the world.\nI would not categorise myself within the bastardisation of the word ‘woke’ and have a disdain for virtue-signalling, but I fully embrace how important it is for a civilised society to accept all people regardless of background.\nThe groups he was celebrating have suffered very badly in the past and so I can see all the reasons our country should be proud of it.\nYet, whilst praise for a tolerant and liberal society is justified, I sensed - and I could be wrong - that Starmer used it also to goad Farage somewhat.\nIt may be one of the many tactics they have in store for him over the next five years, because they will need to do everything they can if they wish to stop him.\nForce Farage\nLike him or loathe him, agree with him or not, I believe Farage will go down as one of the most revolutionary figures in our history. Were his achievements in Roman times and we could only read about his feats, we may all be wondering quite how one man was able to impress his will without ever having taken any official power.\nHis very personable persona disguises just what a brilliant mind he has and just how determined and singularly bloody-minded he is.\nIn a strange way, Starmer’s lack of charisma understates just how politically talented he is too, but I believe his flimsy beliefs will be overwhelmed by a man who has spent decades espousing the one same message about immigration.\nStarmer is up against a person who forced the most powerful man in our country to launch the Brexit vote; won the Brexit vote, taking our country out of one of the most powerful political organisations in the world against the might of Tory, Labour, Lib Dem, Green, and SNP party machines as well as the desperate wheeling out of four former Prime Ministers in Brown, Blair, Cameron and Major; and has now reduced the oldest political party in the world to rubble - all without being an MP. Just think what he could do to Labour now he is in the henhouse.\n(To be fair to Starmer, he did ruthlessly maul his former friend, party leader and staunchly Labour comrade to pieces, whilst attempting to take out every other left leaning Corbynista across the country, so he is no pushover either.)\nI cannot see Starmer and his team (Blair, Mandleson, Stewart, et al) take Farage lightly and will have already hatched many plans to thwart him.\nOne such plan should involve focusing the lense on his leadership style and authoritarian-strong manifesto.\nFarage the Authoritarian\nLike all of us, everyone has flaws.\nReform’s manifesto, whilst in many ways feels like common sense, contains a number of elements that could be perceived as racist, intolerant and authoritarian, whilst there are dictatorship tendencies in some of Farage’s leadership style.\nHe has already spoken about democratising his party, and his awareness of this will be crucial because it could end up undermining all his hard work in convincing people to trust him thus far.\nUnfortunately, this has yet to happen.\nHe turfed out the Clacton Reform Parliamentary Candidate and promoted himself to leader, demoting Tice, all after saying shortly before he wouldn’t even stand as an MP.\nThis has now been followed by the ousting of Ben Habib as Deputy Leader, now replaced by Tice, who said ‘Reform cannot make the argument for democracy, let alone champion it, with such a glaring democratic deficit.'\nMoreover, Farage’s philosophy, as quoted, is “peace through strength”, which has an ominous tone to it that manifests itself into a number of polices in their so-called contract.\nThe Reform Contract\nHe seeks:\nZero tolerance policing; to build 10,000 new detention spaces; recruit 40,000 new police; recruit preferably ex-military into police leadership; send youth offenders to high intensity training camps; recruit 30,000 more into the military; increase military spending by £14bn; permit tax breaks for military manufacturing and technology; introduce a patriot curriculum in schools; make the British Armed forces independent; protect military personnel from UK civil law; and leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\nThese may be attractive policies from many sections of the public’s perspective, but from the perspective that these types of authoritarian minded people get to be in charge of all of this, I worry.\nThough it’s hard to see, the tone echoes that of another country in another time.\nThat is without mentioning the overt racism in one particular policy of the manifesto that I am surprised was legal.\nThe policies in the ECHR are as any person who believes in basic human rights would want them to be, but if they are to go, what is the replacement document? Or is he saying he advocates us losing all of our human rights?\nMulticulturalism\nIt is all in the name of giving “our country back to ordinary people”, but in my view there is no such thing.\nOur multicultural society is here to stay (you can’t throw people out the country who were born here, nor should you because very few of us would be left!), and so the key is to work out how to ensure we can live together in harmony.\nFarage’s comments on the Leeds riots serve to inflame the division and plays perfectly into his narrative.\nIt’s so easy to join the dots and suggest people are unable to get on based on their colour or creed, but look around and you’ll find peace and harmony almost everywhere regardless of background.\nIn this case, the individuals who broke the law should, and have been arrested like any other citizen of the UK.\nFor those who believe in his dream to rid these people off our shores - he cannot do it.\nPlay it out for a second.\nHow does he divide up all the people that he deems worthy to go?\nIs it first, second or third generation? Is it by continent? How much blood of the Celts, Romans, Germanic, Scandinavian or French is permitted to be classed British? What shade of brown is acceptable?

There is already a strong sense of overreach and it will only push otherwise perfectly liberal-minded people, who understandably are sick of it all, over to Farage, as he is seen as the only hope they have to put a stop to it.\nI wish Farage was the one to fix these problems, but he is not a peacemaker.\nHe is an aggressor whose polices will stoke anger in others that will eventually lead to violence, which will self-prophecise into the need for more violence in the name of security and protection.\nNo one is saying we shouldn’t sort illegal immigration out; have a very serious conversation about dropping net migration, review cultural integration policies; exercise pride in our British culture (whatever that may be); and attend to by law, those in our country that seek to overthrow the British way of life, but Farage’s path requires deep questioning as this type of politics has been tried before.\nWe are a free and liberal country and already live in relative peace. For those who want their country back, I would argue, but for a few turns in the wrong direction, our country never left us.",

Moreover, ‘access’ has never been the issue regarding greenbelt and open spaces - the environment, wildlife, public services and infrastructure are generally considered to be the main concerns - so I’m not entirely sure why that was even mentioned.\nCllr Cowan goes on to highlight that it was suggested [by a housing developer presumably], that “they would put in a new country park.” The mere fact a conversation has taken place is proof the land is being primed for development, but this is not a revelation as news has already been publicised in the Echo several times over.\nWhen it has been raised it has been swatted away by some gaslighting local politicians as scaremongering - but no longer.\nThe Leader of Southend Council has now publicised exactly what he thinks and if Southend residents care about this issue it may be prudent to get a head-start in swatting this back because my prediction is this land will be re-classified as newly invented ‘greybelt’ land - so-coined under Labour - and will be cemented and sold for housing, country park or not.\nLabour’s great greenbelt dig-up\nCllr Cowan’s building over Bournes Green comments came in response to the motion at Full Council that seeked to save greenbelt land and green spaces in Southend and help support our neighbours in Hadleigh save theirs. (Read the motion here: https://democracy.southend.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=64550).\nIn his response to the motion he went on to admonish the Tories for their part in providing inadequate infrastructure (not necessarily wrong) which appeared only as a deflection device to avoid the fact that it is his very own Labour government that are the perpetrators of concreting the country.\nDespite Labour’s 2024 national manifesto being a barely readable dirge, it could still be seen that their great greenbelt and green spaces dig-up was very much there for all to see. They weren’t hiding this!\nLabour will ride roughshod over local councils who will no longer have the power to stop them. As it happens, in Southend’s case, the roughshod is not necessary as Southend Labour are opening the floodgates most willingly.\nLocal Housing Need\nStrangely, to back up his argument about building on greenbelt in Bournes Green, Cllr Cowan’s rant included a point about Southend having nowhere for doctors and dentists to live. This, of course, is a false and exaggerated statement as there are plenty of properties on the market as we speak, but it serves the narrative to accentuate the housing need.\nHowever I can’t disagree there is a housing need. You can’t have a net migration of almost a million people a year without having to make some room for them! And that’s despite there already being a very real local need. I know many who would love to move out of the family home and stay in Southend, but can’t.\nMore housing would be great for them, but while it is possible for local planning authorities to ‘oblige the developer to sell or rent housing to people who reside in the area’, according to the government website ‘few actually do’ (https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/can-access-to-housing-be-restricted-to-local-people/).\nThe “local connection test” or “principal residence test” can be included in the local plan (a plan for the land of Southend), but there has to be robust evidence to support it’s implementation.\nI am not sure what robust evidence is required, but if Labour are pursuing gutting the greenbelt based on the premise of housing need then it should be accepted that Southend’s need already exists and should, therefore, be added into the local plan.\nInterestingly, Cllr Cowan said in a recent Cabinet meeting that “more local people” would benefit in the Fossett’s housing development as “we have the nomination rights”. Now said, never forgotten, and I await with interest just how many local people will be served in this development.\nAffordability\nAside from Fossetts, the prioritisation of local people is rarely mentioned, but even if they were, most developments are unaffordable.\nIn the first place they often start with a relatively low percentage of affordable homes relative to the total properties approved, but what’s worse is developers frequently exercise a loophole that cites changing financial conditions as a means to prove affordable housing is no longer viable and it is then swiftly ditched.\nWhilst financial conditions can change, I believe this should have already been factored into the business plan. Legislation around this area needs to change!\nWhat does all this mean?\nLabour will override local councils to green-light the destruction of greenbelt land and green spaces on the false premise of building affordable homes for local people.\nIn other words, build another 20,000 properties in Southend (the target previously identified and then abandoned by the Tories) and we will very likely see the same 1500 Southend families waiting for housing. Locals are not prioritised and even if they were, properties are unaffordable.\nIdeally, I would like to see the Local Plan include cast-iron protection of all greenbelt land and green spaces and the prioritisation of local people in any new developments with a far higher quota for affordable housing. I would also like to see a national stance that sees net migration aim to as close to zero as possible.\nSome might call me a NIMBY, others may see it as protecting where we live!\nIncidentally, in contradiction to both national and local Labour rhetoric, the council voted unanimously to back the motion to object to the development on the Salvation Army development and building on greenbelt land and open spaces in Southend.\nFor the recorded debate, see: https://southend.public-i.tv/core/portal/webcast_interactive/937183\nEcho report on Bournes Green Chase:\nEcho News, - 02/01/2025 - Page 8\nEcho News, - 02/01/2025 - Page 9",

Although this hasn’t changed, the political structures we thought we’d be working within likely will.\nDevolution and ‘local government reorganisation’ (LGR) will see our original mission that concentrated primarily on Southend, change to a wider brief that will encompass Rochford and Castle Point as well as the entirety of Essex.\nWe had always intended to expand eventually, but never like this.\nRegarding LGR, which is the re-shaping of the boundaries of local councils, of course we would be delighted to work with our neighbours as they are very much part of what I would arbitrarily consider local. The main gripe, however, is that all of us will be swallowed up by each other.\nSouthend has a population of 180,000 and this proposed new council will be somewhere close to 400,000, which will make it much harder for residents to engage with councillors. And whilst we are indeed local to each other that does not mean we know each other well enough to make comment on what’s best for where we each live. What does someone in Shoebury know about Canvey Island ? And vice-versa?\nRegarding devolution, which is the transference of select powers from central government to local government, a new entity called the Mayoral Combined County Authority, will be a ruling body with an elected Mayor of Essex at the helm enriched with all manner of powers, responsibilities and money - one of them being the ability to charge a new precept.\nWhilst I am always proud to represent my party in any capacity, as I have done so at both local and general elections, I put myself forward for Mayor of Essex unsupportive of the position itself and run despite my anti-devolution and anti-LGR stance in its current form.\nI dislike intensely the lack of any public consultation with the current consultation see if only as a tick box exercise that has little to do with shaping what it might have been.\nAll this does not mean I am not serious about being elected Mayor of Essex and would carry out the task to the best of my abilities.\nThus, this blog is not really about the announcement of my candidacy, though I have shoehorned some justification of my abilities to do so, but rather a critique of the Mayoral position and its pitfalls based off the information presented in the English White Paper on Devolution.\nI discuss the absence of the quality of the person versus the mayoral system; the Mayor’s remit; whether the Mayor is truly empowered; and finally brief rundown of why residents of Essex might vote for me in the potential election on May 7th, 2026.\nSystem versus the person\nPeople in strategic positions spend much time creating and developing the system, and whilst I agree that great systems are vital, I can’t tell you the amount of times even the best ones fail when in the hands of the wrong person.\nIf the broad goal for a government is to create an environment where we are all healthy and happy, then good people will figure out what to do to make that happen.\nTherefore, the expensive experiment that is about to be undertaken due to Southend, Thurrock and Essex Councils miraculously agreeing to put us forward to be considered for the devolution programme and change our system of local government, will not necessarily change things for the better regardless of what the political aficionados say.\nWhoever was responsible for writing the White Paper on English Devolution seemed to miss the importance of the person themselves. Given that the central premise is to establish a Mayor with significant powers I find this all the more concerning.\nNot once does the paper talk about the competency, qualifications, political philosophy, moral compass, work history or skills, knowledge and experience of the person who would become Mayor. Instead it talks about all the glory the position itself can bring.\nParts of the White Paper effectively amount to a job description, and I dare say there are a few gaps in my CV given the breadth of the role. However, I am dead-sure the same will be true of the other candidates.\nThere will be council officers who will, perhaps, be able to fill these gaps, and the Mayor will be able to select their own group of people to assist, but still it is a mammoth task.\nThe Mayor’s Remit\nThe Government are talking about centralising decisions to the Mayor’s office which will include: transport; economic growth; housing; skills and education; public safety - even going as far as taking the powers of the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) and Fire and Rescue Authority (FRA); and health, where they will be invited to chair the NHS Integrated Care Partnership.\nI wonder how much the candidates, whomever they may be, will truly know about assessing suitable bus routes throughout Essex; how to start a business, run it successfully and grow industry; the needs of residents when considering land for housing development; keeping people safe when combating terrorism; and exactly how to run a hospital or GP surgery.\nYet, the White Paper says Mayors will receive ‘unprecedented powers’ over all these areas, even going on to say that ‘when residents elect a Mayor, they need to know that key decisions cannot be blocked by a single council’ and ‘a desire for perfect consensus must not get in the way of tough decisions.’ It has the faint ring of a local dictatorship, dare I say, as they become one of the most powerful and influential people in Essex. The system certainly lends itself to corruption, which has been seen in other areas.\nThey will oversee a vast empire including places with unique demands such as Colchester, Chelmsford, Southend-on-Sea, Basildon, Harlow, Clacton-on-Sea, Canvey Island, Thurrock, Harwich, Maldon, Braintree and Saffron Walden, and to echo my point earlier, who can possibly understand the needs of all of the people in all these places?\nI am sure I and the other candidates could pick it up in time, but are we sure that empowering so much to one person is the right system that will make us all happy and healthy?\nI’m not sure what CV would be suitable, but the wrong person at the right table has the potential for catastrophe - just look at London. Just look at the country for that matter.\nWe have ‘Rachel from accounts’ running the economy into the ground backed up by a Business Secretary who has never run a business, but is instead a lawyer, not lawyer.\nIt points to a larger problem in our electoral system and one that will extend to the Mayoral position.\nIs the Mayor really Empowered?\nThere is an inherent contradiction to the Mayor’s power if you read the Labour version of devolution.\nThe way the White Paper has been written points toward the accussation that it is a way of simplifying top-down government.\nNewly elected Mayors will be delighted to hear they will attend a ‘Council of Nations’ Chaired by the Prime Minister no less. These meetings will be integral in making Mayors ‘fundamental partners to the government in delivering its missions’ whilst at the same time ‘allowing areas to take back control.’\nWhat I cannot quite understand is if Government missions are conceived by Government (as in the Labour Party) then how are Mayors taking back control of their areas if it is being directed to them?\nI doubt very much they considered the idea of a local party such as Confelicity putting forward candidates, but I would certainly not be there to be a conduit to implementing Labour Party policy if I and any of my Party do not agree with it.\nFor example, one of their missions is to effectively gut the greenbelt and build 1.5 million homes across the country with Essex picking up its fair share of that strain. Sir Kier insultingly labels those who do not want to live in a concrete city ‘blockers’.\nI do not want any part of it.\nI believe strongly that Essex, and particularly Southend, is so built up already that we barely have any room left.\nI say no, unequivocally, to building 10,000 homes on Bournes Green Chase, Hadleigh Farmland or any other green or grey belt land for that matter.\nIn Southend, the 1500 families that are on the housing waiting list have been used as the excuse to justify big housing developments. I say excuse because rarely does any of the housing go to these people as they cannot afford it. It is effectively a lie and we see it over and over again. The Bellway development in Shoebury is a good example, where reports are coming in that the affordable housing quota cannot be met due to the well trodden loophole that the project would no longer be financially viable.\nI do not begrudge new housing and the need is definitely there, but I do have a problem with over-populating an area, ripping up our green spaces and without any progress to house those who need it.\nAddressing immigration is the fundamental solution in this instance and one I would be eager to discuss with the Prime Minister if I ever got a seat at the table. I must say my view is in no relation to the arguments on multiculturalism or infrastructure, we simply have too many people living here and we are destroying our environment.\nWhy vote for me?\nI have spent almost 30 years working to help build a successful family business with all the experience that has taught me. I have a broad set of skills such as leading people, handling finance, public safety, crisis management, and general management skills involving efficiency and productivity.\nI believe in basic values such as democracy, localism, respectful freedom of speech, compassion and empathy.\nI didn’t have a silver spoon growing up having spent my childhood on social benefits, and I was educated in what was known as one of the worst schools in Essex at the time - Thorpe Bay High School - which did teach me a good dose of humility. I did go to university as a mature student and picked up a few Business Degrees along the way.\nI started a local independent political party for Southend having been a member of the Labour Party for 15 years, and stood in several elections building a steady interest in Confelicity. One of the reasons I am standing as Mayor of Essex - aside from trying to win - is to put Confelicity on a wider platform in which people can hear our local message.\nA vote for me is a vote for true local democracy. I will not know the needs of every residents across the county, but I and Confelicity have a proven track record to put residents front and centre of decision-making and that will continue.\nWith no connection to the national parties we are not encumbered with anything that does not fit the local agenda. Building on greenbelt and over-population are just a number of issues that I would be fighting against. I would reject the so-called ‘national missions’ of Labour if they do not coincide with what matters to the residents of Essex.\nAs a businessman I recognise the need to create a great business environment to pay for all the public services we all want. Taxing people to death is not the answer to a flourishing economy. The answer is allowing businesses to grow and create jobs.\nDespite my deep reservations about the Mayoral position, devolution and LGR, I believe strongly that a locally-minded Mayor may have the best chance to make this system work, and if elected I would do my upmost to preserve Essex as it is, while only making changes that are truly necessary and in the interests of the residents.\nReferences",

Southend residents in for 85000 truck movements of soil for Bellways project\n- James Miller\n- Jun 7, 2023\n- 4 min read\nReview of Place Scrutiny Committee 5th June\nThere are due to be 85,000 trucks to move in and out of Southend in order to transport soil for the new Bellway housing development in Shoebury.\nThis development has already been approved by the Development Control Committee.\nThe route for the trucks had also been previously agreed.\nThis was all done under the previous Labour, Liberal Democrat and Independent Group coalition.\nIt should have been glaringly obvious that residents would find 85000 trucks moving through Southend a problem and a solution should have been provided before anything was approved. Somehow, the Labour-led coalition did not do this.\nScrutinising Questions that should already have been asked\nThis is a mess, make no mistake. It could have been avoided with a different set of decision-makers, but what is dumbfounding is that some of the questions asked by the very same people who made the decision to accept the Bellway project in its current guise, should have asked them before they agreed it! The questions were being asked as though they had nothing to do with it. For anyone watching for the first time, you might have thought the Portfolio Holder was the mastermind behind the whole plan. For the councillors and officers that live in this tiny political bubble, I cannot imagine this didn't occur to them.\nIn fact, the Tories had pledged to explore alternative routes, which is what this motion was all about.\nThe new administration are sensibly looking into alternatives by sea or rail, and if they pull it off then that would be a relief for the trouble that very few residents realise is due to come our way.\nBut this is a last minute rescue job that was instigated by someone in the council whose job is not based on the concerns of residents.\nStopping Stupid\nOn a side-note, I have written before about one of the goals of our party being to ‘Stop Stupid’. I mentioned that is was a crass statement. However, this is once again one of those matters that you can’t quite believe is happening and have to spend half your time on a goal that is simply to take things back to normality.\nSticking to guns\nTo be fair, many other questions raised were consistent with sticking to the plan and really seeked the Portfolio Holder to accept that pursuing alternative transport is a forlorn hope.\nI found the audacity of the leader of the opposition piling on the criticism for the Portfolio Holder to seek to make amends for the very policy his party implemented quite difficult to swallow. There is a damage limitation exercise going on and questions really ought to have been geared towards how to make this possible, not all the reasons why it shouldn't be done.\nHowever, a special mention should go out for Labour Councillor Martin Berry, who was actually ok with the Tory motion. A ray of light to see party politics shoved to the side and how he spoke only to represent his St Luke’s ward residents.\nBellways' Perspective\nIt is true to say that Bellways have a plan and a budget, and they do not want this altered. Any conversation that doesn’t match up to this they will no doubt be against. But, they themselves need to recognise the disruption they are about to cause and any future developments they may wish to pursue in Southend may not be met with the same goodwill as they have received so far. How this manifests itself within the legal framework is difficult to tell, however, they will know how important having Southend onside is.\nUltimately, it had to make financial sense for Bellway and being that they are moving forward with this, it can be assumed it does. Bellway are well within their rights to make money, that is their business. It is not the fault of Bellways that individuals in high places within the council were not astute enough to realise the potential problems, or if they did, were not adequately motivated to do anything about it.\nQuestions I would have asked\nThe truth is approving a development that requires 85,000 of truck movements over 2 years should never have been allowed. What desperation was there to build on this land?\nWhy, when it was discovered that this soil was required, was the land continued to be made available? When did Bellway know of the requirement? Did they know before they purchased the land? If before, were they given guarantees that they would be permitted to do this? If so, by whom? Was it part of the price? Was the land sold by the council or was it already privately owned? If the council owned it, and knowingly sold it with this issue, who approved it? Why did Bellway take on this project with such a significant requirement? What financial incentives were they given - if any? Were residents ever considered?\nMy View\nIt is absolutely right to explore all the options of the bad hand that has been dealt. There may well be many issues with the exploration and if indeed it turns out there to be nothing that can be done then fair enough. But residents do not want all these truck movements and we need to work backwards from that.\nResidents will not want this.\nIf it happens, they will want to know that everything was done to prevent it. This is what the Tories are doing. And whether for political gain or not, I support it.",

But more importantly, we need decent shops!\nThere are those that have given up and are ready to turn the high street residential. More properties are fine, but I say do not give up retail.\nThere is a way!\nI believe that within the people of Southend are countless great ideas for starting a business, and that there are enough people in the city that would buy any given product/service.\nHowever, experience tells me that the cost of starting a business, particularly in the High Street may prove too high a barrier for most people.\nI have worked for and alongside one of Southend’s most successful entrepreneurs for almost 27 years, have gained a wealth of invaluable managerial and business knowledge and experience, have a 1st Class Degree and Masters Degree in Business (MBA), and would still feel cautious about the success of any business I were to start in the high street.\nOwner/Operators\nOnce upon a time every shop was owned and operated by Southend people. Butchers, clothing, fruit and veg, and so on. Then the influx of national chains came in and stole a march on the independents.\nEvery high street looked the same, and the people working in them by and large did and do not have the same passion as the indies.\nThey were charged enormous rents and rates, which local entrepreneurs could then not afford.\nNow in very quick circumstances we find the nationals going down one by one.\nMost argue this is because of online shopping, and while this has certainly had a major impact, the impact is not because people don’t like physically shopping, because we still do and would continue to do if the shops were there!\nIt is that the nationals/MNEs could no longer afford to sell from those premises because the cost base was so high to be sustainable and their reaction to the change has been catastrophically slow. This due largely because the staff on the shop floor - who actually see what is going on - in the main do not care about the business and failed to pass vital information on to the board who were happy in their ivory towers.\nThere is a huge window of opportunity for the return of Southend owner/operators in the high street selling unique products and services only available in Southend. BUT it cannot be done if the costs don’t work!\nSouthend Council, alongside our MPs, must fight tooth and nail to bring down and influence the reduction of business costs.\nIt really is a simple equation: lowest possible costs equal business survival. Combine that with a good service or product and the business will thrive and employ more people.\nThe more people with jobs, the more people with money, and the more money can be spent on products and services creating a thriving economy that is able to pay for the public services we wall want.\nConnecting education to industry\nOne part of my job as Operations Director is overseeing recruitment.\nI have interviewed over 10,000 of Southend's youth and over the years I have formed several observations. Firstly, they are generally speaking very talented people.\nThe energy, fun, intellect, and potential are absolutely there.\nSecondly, there seems very few opportunities in Southend for them to fulfil their potential. This, often accompanied with home-life issues, then seems to lead them to feeling lost, leaving many of them disillusioned, depressed and in some cases suicidal.\nOn countless occasions I would be the one who they went to for help despite the fact that I was grossly out of my depth, and the best I could do was send them home from work.\nFortunately, I learnt of the concept of Chaplaincy while at university. They are a multi-faith confidential listening service, but who mainly come from a Christian background.\nWith the help of former Southend Chief of Police Mick Thwaites, Chaplain Hannah Bucke was introduced to the Company.\nAdventure Island and our other businesses soon became a place that could support those with mental health issues, and on Hannah’s recommendation we now also pay for counselling, which is arranged on the day.\nIt gladdens me that I have been able to be an integral part in this, however, the causes still played on my mind.\nOne of the causes is the feeling of having no direction after they finish college or university.\nThey spent years learning the trade of film director, journalist, musician, artist, engineering and so on. Then suddenly the last exam is done.\nFor instance, they just spent all their time putting together what they think might be the new Tarantino movie for which they were immensely proud of, then suddenly the course finishes and they are no longer film directors.\nIn their minds they had real purpose and direction and then nothing overnight. They spend some time working out how they are going to be film directors and then work out that it is in fact not possible - certainly not in Southend!\nThe same can be said for nearly all the subjects that are taught in Southend's further education. Often their courses lead to nothing to do with their subject, and it begs the question: why are they taught it?\nThere is a solution that could both utilise the skills of our youth and kick-start the local economy.\nThe college and university are educating our youth in specific trades, who then waste all their learning and skill as they enter the workforce doing something quite unrelated.\nIdeally every skilled person should be able to sell their products and services in Southend High Street and online at nearly no cost.\nFor example, all the fashion students should be able to sell their garments in the high street. There are hundreds of fashion students in the city with great skills, and who could produce products that no other town has.\nIt would be the sustainable competitive advantage that could never be replicated. And you could apply this to all trades and skills that are learnt.\nBelief in Ourselves\nTurn back the hands of time and all industries had to start somewhere.\nThere is no reason why Southend can’t be a hub for any which industry we choose.\nWe already have the talent, which is the hardest part, simply providing facilities which they can use to maximise its potential is the very least a forward thinking and inspirational Council could do.\nImagine a high street and online services packed full of Southend talent selling products and services only available from us.\nThis is not to exclude the nationals returning. In fact, when they see a thriving hive of bustling business, they may feel the momentum to justify coming back themselves.\nWe would be turning back the hands of time with local people running businesses for the people of Southend.\nWe just need the drive and belief that we can do it ourselves.",

A brilliant night at the Cliff’s saw Justin and his leadership team inspire the fans of an optimistic future\n- James Miller\n- Jan 26, 2024\n- 5 min read\nI have watched from afar at the miraculous rescue of Southend United in which a great many people did the impossible and saved the club.\nWe know Justin Rees and his Consortium have been pivotal and their plaudits will be eternal - as long as they do not go down the same path as the previous owner! Having attended the Consortium's evening at the Cliff's Pavilion, I have never been more inspired and confident in a leadership team.\nJustin, himself, is the type of leader I would love to follow. The impression he gives me is that he is very confident in himself and is perfectly happy to invite everyone into his gang. He is a man of the people, because he really is a man of the people. And without exception, all the other consortium members were just as genuine, passionate, experienced and community driven. It was an amazing story of how this group were brought together, many citing just 10 minute conversations with Justin! These are people with whom strong foundations can be built and they truly understand the history of the club and what they want it to become. If they were a political party I'd vote for them!\nIt cannot be overstated what they have done for our city. Southend United is much more than a football club, just as any organisation that brings people together.\nFuture generations will never know the scale of the rescue, and any future World Cup winning stars from Southend will owe their success to them!\nI believe the consortium, at some point, if all goes well, will also deserve the keys to the city along with the brilliant Maher.\nTurning to the manager, what a modest and humble guy he is. With the 1600 strong audience applauding him gratefully when he took to the stage, he could only pass on his gratitude to everyone bar himself! He kept the spirit going and the positive results coming in when no one really knew whether there was any future to win for. Such integrity and a sense of duty, and it is more good news that he has confirmed he will be part of the future.\nBut what of the fans?\nIt was their love of Southend United that rallied overwhelming political support from Anna Firth MP, who, in the face of a severely Tory-hating climate from many quarters, received a surprising round of applause as Justin paid tribute to her. The same is true of the many key councillors who did everything they could, as well other important stakeholders. Without this support, the club would have been finished, as the courts had reportedly permitted the club to exist where in nearly all other circumstances this would not have been the case.\nThere are countless other worthy causes across the city that desperately need help, but none have been lucky enough to have behind them such a tidal wave of people power to smash any obstacles aside. The auditorium was packed out with deeply loyal fans who were hanging on to every word of the night to ensure their battling had been fought for good reason. I feel sure they would be happy.\nSo many devoted fans involved in the rescue and they will know who they are within the crowd. I hope the public will hear of them in due course because they too did the impossible. They can stand proudly as equals amongst those who resuscitated life back into Southend United.\nTo Business\nYet, we mustn’t forget the new owners are in business, and whilst it may well be a labour of love for them, they are looking for the club to sustain itself going forward, and dare I say it, make a profit. As it stands, they are funding the £2m deficit and are looking for new ways to increase revenue. The call was for the fans to invest into the club, which I am certain they will do.\nOnce-upon-a-time Ron Martin may have received a similar heroes welcome - now he is the villain. I cannot see that happening with this leadership team, and with the team playing so well, despite everything, there is optimism about winning promotion this season. But it could just as easily go wrong on the field. A run of bad luck hits morale and a couple of injuries to key players could land us in trouble. After all, it is football and anything can happen.\nI previously wrote an article trying to get into the skin of Ron Martin and why he wasn’t selling at the time (https://www.southendconfelicityparty.co.uk/post/selling-southend-united-is-the-only-solution-everything-else-is-just-politics), because to an outsider, it seemed so wrong.\nWe know how he almost killed the club, but he was first and foremost a businessman and that meant putting his survival before the Southend United. And it should not be unexpected if a similar set of circumstances unfolded with the new owners, however much their love of the blues are clearly woven into the club.\nIn this sense, we probably need to manage our expectations of Justin and his team and make sure we continue to back him even if expectations remain only modest. The consortium openly stated \"we are not billionaires\", and so we may need to be content that the players and staff get paid, we avoid the courts for late payments, avoid point deductions for financial issues, and are able to field enough players that would be considered a squad! I realise those expectations may be conservative, but we can't take anything for granted these days!\nCommunity\nMy hope is they run it like a true community football club that is mainly made up of local players.\nI was lucky enough to have my question asked at the Q&A, and it was confirmed there were plans to bring the academy back - but just not yet.\nI was pleased to hear this, and I hope, once they overcome the urgent barriers, they take this further than ever before.\nI once played for Southend Manor during my youth, and I have played against many players I always felt could have been professionals had they been given the right opportunities.\nThere are thousands of players in the local area who pay to play football each week for their local teams and would be honoured just to stand on the Roots Hall pitch, let alone get paid for it!\nIf we implemented a strong scouting system I feel confident in years to come we would do very well indeed. Parents would likely pay a nominal amount to have their kids put in front of the scouts, so it could even be self-funding. Either way it is done, utilising local talent as the foundation of the club I hope will become the underpinning philosophy of the club. There’s nothing like getting behind our own. That’s not to cut off the rest of the world, but being that we can’t afford the rest of the world, this seems the most stable and sustainable route to success. And who are going to be more passionate about Southend United than those who grew up here and had aspirations to one day play at Roots Hall?\nThe new owners will be keen to retain the goodwill they are currently in enshrined in, and I dare say this may be one aspect that would continue to win everyone over.\nBut for now, very well done to Justin, the consortium, the politicians, and the fans for bringing the club back from the brink, and let's hope for a community-lead successful football club that we can all be proud of for years to come.",

A local party in the most local election going!\n- James Miller\n- Sep 6, 2024\n- 2 min read\nUpdated: Sep 22, 2024\nWe are so proud to announce the candidacies of Jane Wilkes, standing in Highlands, and Tris Bembridge, standing in Thames, in the forth-coming Leigh Town Council by-elections on October 3rd.\nAs a local party devoted to local issues, running in a parish council election makes perfect sense for us.\nWe are aware that LTC was founded to be an independent organisation run for local residents and understand the controversy when the Conservatives stood unopposed in the last election.\nI previously wrote a blog about how powerful and effective parish councils can be, so we are completely behind it:\nSince that election thousands of Leigh residents have made their voices clear with protests and social media pressure. There was even a popular call to hold another election to allow others to stand. Alas, they did not take up that opportunity.\nThe competency of the Conservatives was called into question relentlessly and four Councillors have since resigned in a short space in time.\nAlthough we share the same first three letters in our name, we are not the Conservatives. We are as local a party as they come and we love listening and debating issues with residents.\nFor those who believe LTC should be independent and without party politics - we wholeheartedly agree! However, we are not quite a normal party. We are ground-level, walk past us every day and grab a conversation with us local. We live and breath Southend. We all have a stake in our city being better in every way because any benefits will be directly felt by us. Our super-democratic approach allows all residents - regardless of party - to join us in a our manifesto meetings and vote on the subjects at hand. And…any vote must be unanimous for it to become policy. In other words, our candidates are free to act independently.\nThe introduction of Reform candidates is very interesting indeed. I wrote a blog about their manifesto recently, which I believe sheds a little more light of what they would like to see in the future: https://www.southendconfelicityparty.co.uk/post/farage-is-for-ordinary-people-who-want-their-country-back-but-did-our-country-ever-leave-us\nTo our candidates, Jane is Head of politics at a local school, whilst Tris is one of the most knowledgable guys I know about Southend politics. To find out more:\nOur main themes include:\nProtecting greenbelt land and preserving our green spaces, and supporting the movement against sewage in our seas.\nProtecting LTC and LCC.\nShowing the upmost respect to residents’ concerns, ideas and act in an open and transparent way to let everyone know what’s going on at the council.\nYou wouldn’t think a by-election in a parish council would bring so much excitement, but here we are!\nMay I wish all the candidates the very best of luck in the campaign. I know our candidates will be respectful and will keep things clean. I feel confident that will be the case for all involved.",

We were told Labour and Tories would be annihilated and though that is not strictly true, the change in vote share has been severe.\nReform’s popularity has gained a credibility that any Conservatives clutching on to the strategy of ‘vote Reform, get Labour’ is finished. The light at the end of the tunnel for them is that Labour is equally finished. The question is just how the right wing finish them.\nWere I in Farage’s position I would never join with the Tories. The Lib Dem’s suffered the consequences of that as did Farage himself after the Brexit vote. Assuming that being the case Labour still have a very real chance of winning any upcoming elections where they are the strongest left wing party.\nThe cancellation (or postponement as some prefer to call it) of the Essex local elections due to the undemocratic implementation of devolution and ‘local government reorganisation’ would have seen Reform transform the make-up of the councils.\nThose who orchestrated the cancellation will be quietly (or loudly) patting themselves on the back knowing they have shielded both Labour and Conservatives from possible wipe outs.\nAt the expense of democracy they live to fight on for now. They will hope that something happens to Reform by 2026. Anything that will destroy them will do. Whoever has been tasked with this responsibility will have to get their thinking caps on as time is starting to run out.\nWith Reform conquering the UK, if Confelicity successfully campaign to stop the cancellation of the 2026 elections in Southend and they go ahead, we will not likely benefit - but so be it. The campaign was only ever about our right to vote, pure and simple.\nLee Clark, our superhero candidate who puts Kursaal residents at the very heart of what he does, may well claim a unique victory in his ward. He works tirelessly on a voluntary basis on top of his immense charity work.\nTraditionally Kursaal is a Labour ward, but those rules will be forgotten. At a guess it will be between Lee and whichever Reform candidate is put up. The incumbent, Cllr Dent, who also happens to be Cabinet Member for Culture, Tourism and Business, has gone full Emperor in Gladiator by giving the mob (us) what we want by desperately suggesting he will bring back the Air Show. You never know - it could work!\nWe have other candidates who should do well, such as Diane Sossou in Thorpe Ward. With Cllr Terry holding on to his one vote victory last time round everything is to play for. Many times a strong campaign is enough and could prove to be the case here.\nI will also be looking to increase my share of the vote in Leigh, while I also stand as the Mayor of Essex.\nWhere Confelicity will be 4 years in by then and our reputation as a locally focussed independent party established, we might reasonably have expected to be many voters’ party of choice and picked up some seats. Alas, this may now be less likely. However, given that Confelicity is made up of Southend residents who have day jobs and busy lives, not being elected is not the end of the world. Whatever happens we will continue to provide a local voice and address local concerns too big for the national parties to pay due attention.\nFor those whose livelihoods are dependent on election success that is another matter.\nIf the 2026 elections go ahead with Reform involved, I can see it being the dirtiest election in years. But that’s the point - the dirtiest tactic available and the one guarenteed to succeed is to cancel the 2026 elections.\nFor those tasked with defying Reform they will have no other choice. Reform in Southend are lead by the highly experienced former Tory Leader, Cllr Tony Cox, and I am sure they will easily find enough candidates to stand in all 17 wards.\nI predict an announcement will be made, for reasons difficult for us commoners to interpret, that the elections will be called off.\nTime and money are the primary arguments already, but I think it will need to be a little stronger as the strength of feeling for Reform has grown and their angst for any future cancellations will not be so easily accepted.\nLabour will need to wait around 3 months to give it enough room for the decision to look unconnected. And the same will be true around the rest of the country where it is possible to do so. It is the only way both Labour and Tories can remain in their seats.\nIt is a naive belief that our politicians will put democracy above their survival, which is why more than ever it is vital Southend residents sign this e-petition: https://democracy.southend.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=99 (petition closes on May 8th).\nWe now need a guarantee from the Labour Leader of Southend City Council, Daniel Cowan, that he 100% backs the elections. No more hiding behind the excuse it is a central government decision - it is his party that are in government and these kind conversations are very possible.\nConclusion\nMy view is there is no amount of money in the world that can justify stamping all over our rights to vote who we want to represent us.\nCancelling elections, and therefore shutting down democracy, should only come through the most extreme circumstances, not some flimsy reason of time, money and bad planning. Labour should have thought about that before they dictated to us that these devolutionary changes would happen.\nOur right to vote is the epicentre of our individual power. It doesn’t really feel like that when we’re in the voting booth casting our one vote amongst millions, but deny us this and our power evaporates.\nDespite democracy being flawed, manipulated and abused and that it produces some horrendous results (depending on your perspective) that rarely pleases anyone let alone everyone, I still believe in it. The requirement to hold elections means the eyes of our leaders are forced to be on us all the time in order to retain their power and how we feel about them is fundamental to them putting bread on their table. The consequences for the misuse of their positions can only really be done at the ballot box.\nI know there are exceptions for democracy to take a back seat, but by and large I believe in it passionately as evidenced by Confelicity’s ‘Undivided Democracy’ voting system where every member must agree unanimously before a policy can make the manifesto.\nAnd so I urge Southend residents to show their interest in where they live and in democracy and take two minutes of their time to register their want for our councillors to do everything in their power to ensure the elections go ahead in 2026.\nI believe so much that Confelicity is the right party to represent us locally. National parties must follow the party line whereas we are governed only by the residents of Southend. We will campaign strongly and we look forward to meeting residents at our rally in Southend High Street on May 10th between 10am and 2pm. However, if Reform is the favoured choice in 2026, so be it - thats democracy.\nWe would never dream of cancelling an election if we thought we couldn’t win, and I sincerely hope Labour, Tories and every other councillor who haven’t yet signed the petition, resist the temptation to do so.\nReference",

Some even think the name was to indicate some connection to the Conservatives because we share the same first three letters!\nWe were originally called The Southend Party, but Jon Humphrys, our Deputy Leader and co-founder, pointed out to us that we may wish to one day expand into other parts of the country, for which the name wouldn’t be quite be so applicable.\nThe eventual name actually came from an article in The Guardian written by Susie Dent from Countdown, which was about brilliant forgotten words of the English language (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/26/respair-cacklefart-positive-words-english-language). And one of those words happened to be Confelicity - meaning ‘joy in another person's happiness’. I liked the meaning and the party voted in favour of it.\nThere is some name-regret because few could pronounce nor understand it, but in the long-run we should be fine! The fluky genius of it is we practically own the word on Google without having to pay a penny!\nSo, if not for some grand plan by Adventure Island to have a theme park run a council, why do we really exist?\nThe reason isn’t anywhere near so grandiose nor clumsily cunning!\nMy Dad happily campaigned with me when I stood for Labour. His main focus is to stop the incomprehensible decision by Labour to charge for parking 6pm to 9pm on the seafront. Aside from that, he is apolitical.\nSadly, for those interested in low-level Southend conspiracy theories, Confelicity has nothing to do with a theme park.\nIt is actually because of Southend Labour. You could argue I am either whistleblowing or sour-graping, but I shall let you decide.\nWhat I thought Labour was\nMy ignorance of what the Labour Party is only became known to me when I pro-actively involved myself in the party around 5 years ago. Previous to that I was a member for over 15 years and a Labour voter since I was legally able to do so.\nAs someone brought up on social benefits, my simple understanding was that Labour looked after people. Conversely, the Tory Party were only for the rich.\nMy vote was easy to give. I wasn’t voting for socialism (I hardly knew what that was) nor did I have any psychological attachment to what might be considered working class, I just wanted a party who I thought cared about people. I needed that care growing up, and so I voted for the party most likely to give it.\nLike most of the country, I have never formerly studied politics. I don’t know the ins and outs of the political structures and history of how everything works. All I think we want is to live happy and healthy lives - it’s not complicated in my eyes. Yet, so much seems to be against achieving this seemingly simple task - hence one of the reasons why I wanted to get involved.\nAnd yet when I entered the world of some of the people that shape the environment we live within, it was not what I thought it’d be.\nInside Southend Labour\nThis Adventure Island noose around my neck has followed me from day one upon my entrance to local politics, but the truth is I grew up in a low-income household and I just wanted to give back. I thought my experience in local business would be useful, but from my first interview as a candidate for the local elections in the ward that I lived in, I found that was not the case.\nI believe judgement was made on my background and I failed to beat a piece of paper for the seat. I did make it the year after having jumped through several hoops, and stood for Labour even though I had already fallen out of love with the party.\nCOVID\nCovid changed everything. I may have ended up leaving eventually for reasons I explain later on, but it wouldn’t have happened so soon.\nI had a big issue with the COVID passport Labour were looking to support unopposed, and I made fairly loud noises about it at the time.\nI’d volunteered in Southend Hospital at the start of the pandemic, but over time I had too many unanswered questions. After I had been selected to run for the seat, I was told that if I didn’t remove a post that asked a question about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, I would be removed from standing.\nI couldn’t believe the lack of democracy or free speech, and I couldn’t believe that a Labour advert stating ‘Let’s Vaccinate Britain’ was how policy was made. There was no conversation, just dictation. I swallowed it because I wanted to stand, but I knew I might not be able to help myself afterwards depending on what was to come next.\nWhat came next was the COVID passport. They were talking about excluding people from society who were not comfortable to put something in their body that they were unsure of. I was never anti-vax, just pro-bodily autonomy. This policy was creeping up ever closer as the months went on, and don't get me wrong, it was the Tories that were driving this insanity and that is where the blame really lies, but Labour's blind support of anything the government were doing went against everything I thought Labour stood for. When the election was over, I couldn’t help but voice my concerns far more vociferously, which inevitably ended with my rejection to stand again the following year.\nThe day after, I started a new party.\nIt would represent respectful freedom of speech; real democracy; locally led decision-making; a positive internal culture of compassion, kindness, integrity and transparency; with idealistic ambitions undeterred by the barriers of practical realities.\nThe Toxic Culture\nThere were personalities in the local group that were just full of hatred. The vitriol between members was verbally violent to the point the internal chat group had to be shut down. There was no leadership and the culture was merciless. It could have been stopped but no attempts were made. Anyone who has joined the multi-party ‘Leigh on Sea Politics for Residents’ group, which I recently set up, will have a taste of what it was like!\nWhy the divide?\nMy view is Labour is a working class party set up to represent working class people. In this pursuit they have been successful and helped create a middle-class that no longer really needs them.\nThe working class still exists and needs representation, however, that’s not where the majority of votes are anymore.\nTo exist, Labour has had to abandon the working class, paying lip service where they can (look at why Angela Rayner is still in her position despite her personal financial controversies). Labour is essentially two parties that coexist badly: those that believe in the original soul of the party and those that believe you can only make change if you win power - which means adapting as required.\nThis is a war that will never end, but each side attempts to win it by banishing the other. This is what is happening now with Starmer. They are perfectly happy to see almost 200,000 members leave because they can conduct business easier that way. And this war has manifested itself all the way down to Southend Labour and into the hearts and minds of the members.\nThe Leadership Purge\nCurrently, there has been a purge in Southend Labour. Anyone who knows Aston Line, the Westborough Councillor and previous Prospective Parliamentary candidate for Southend West, will know what a decent and hard working guy he is. I may not agree with him on certain matters, but no one could question his good intentions - he was deselected from his council seat. As was Cllr Stephen George, a man who has spent his life serving Labour and honouring his father. A man who only recently served as Leader of the Council and Leader of the Southend Labour Group. I didn’t agree with some of his policies, but never did he deserve to be thrown off his seat in the manner in which he was.\nCllr George’s condemnation of current Southend Labour Leader Cllr Daniel Cowan was unequivocal: spiteful, coercive, bullying, egotistical, narcissistic and untruthful.\nAnd then you have Cllr Tricia Cowdrey, Cllr Kathy Murphy and now former Councillor Kay Mitchell, who now all stand as either Independents or non-aligned. They have been brutally honest about their grievances towards Cllr Daniel Cowan making their own set of serious allegations.\nAnd I have mine.\nI have first-hand experience of the interesting ways in which Cllr Cowan operates.\nI received a private message around a week ago stating that an Adventure Island staff member had said some negative things and I was essentially fortunate that he wasn’t going to publicise it ‘out of decency’ - the opposite of what I had done regarding my Cllr George blog.\nHaving requested on several occasions for the information in order to resolve the issues with the staff, it turns out he was trying to ‘hold up a mirror’ and teach me a lesson on how to stay silent.\nI had asked him if he had made a similar approach to the Echo’s editor and journalist who ran the same story, but alas there was no answer. I had asked him whether this approach was standard protocol as a councillor or Leader of Southend Labour - funnily enough: silence.\nAll a bit unsavoury if you ask me!\nOn a lighter note: Fun Fact\nIf you think the Tory’s change in Prime Minister was frequent over the last few years, Southend Labour have actually had three leaders in the last three years!\nWhat I can’t work out is how after winning power a few elections ago they were able to oust their leader almost immediately afterwards. Their system allows for this, and so we await if Cllr Cowan will go the same way. Personally, I doubt it. The purge has already happened and presumably, because he is the leader, most of the group would have had the Cowan stamp of approval.\nThe Southend Labour Plan\nThe facilitator of the Southend Labour manifesto workshop I attended years ago tried his best. But the exercise was really just a token effort. None of what we said went into the manifesto. In fact, the end result I could barely understand! It wasn’t real democracy as far as I judged it, but at least the outcome showed effort had been made.\nThe 5 point plan by Southend Labour outlined in their leaflets this year is pretty thin and more than a touch disingenuous.\nThey blame the Tories for breaking their fortnightly bin collection promise (fair), but it was they, themselves, who instigated fortnightly bin collections in the first place as they allowed fortnightly tenders.\nThey want to ‘attract more visitors to Southend’, but have launched their 6pm to 9pm parking charge punishment all along the seafront. This is off the back of them trying to charge us to park in our local parks last time they were in power!\nThey mention they will tackle potholes like the Tories invented them, but Southend Labour was in power for 4 years and if memory serves, there were plenty back then! It’s an ongoing issue that all parties will struggle with given the material used is clearly not fit for purpose.\nThey mention about reducing anti-social behaviour - sure: how?\nThis is not what I’d call a plan, but I was met with the same hostility of old, as I was tweeted a response that suggested I had a ‘brass-neck’ by Cllr Cowan being that our 68-point manifesto is just a set of ‘woolly statements’! Perhaps he is right - and the hundred or so residents who discussed, debated and voted for it over the last 2 years are wrong!\nDNA\nI wanted to support Labour and was ready to commit my time and energy, but I was in the wrong party the whole time - I just didn’t know it.\nThe truth is this organisation is fundamentally flawed in its DNA. There will never be a leader who can bring both sides together without losing the other half.\nThis is heightened in Southend and so the question is: how can we possibly expect an organisation that is so dysfunctional to run anything?\nThat is not to say the others are perfect - far from it. And nor are we for that matter; plenty of faults we are finding as we blindly navigate this political journey! However, in my opinion, this party at this time, will be catastrophic.\nThey have some great people in the party and many of their policies seem to be perfectly fine, but Southend will be in trouble. You only have to look at the £10m acquisition plus £4m repairs wasted on the half-full Victoria Shopping Centre; the £10m earmarked for the doomed Seaway project putting a cinema next to a cinema and a bowling alley next to a bowling alley; or the failure of the £575m forgotten Queensway development. That’s not forgetting they had plans to charge us to go to the toilet!\nWho is going to do the best for Southend?\nNational Tories are broken, but the locals, not without fault, are seemingly well-run and have almost recovered Southend Labour’s £14m deficit (albeit it is accepted adult and child social care costs played a significant role). Granted, Leigh Town Council Tories seem in dire straits, but that has nothing to do with Southend Council.\nThe Independent Group are not actually independent as they keep crossing the floor depending on who will give them a cabinet position.\nGreens and Lib Dems hard to tell. They just seem to prop up a rainbow coalition. Hopefully the Greens are not successful in negotiating any ULEZ or congestion charging as part of any pact.\nConfelicity, well, we wouldn’t exist had Southend Labour been in any fit shape to lead.\nDo we seek to replace Labour as a left-wing alternative?\nWe certainly have strong roots in protecting and supporting people; and in a brilliant education system that will see people fulfil their potential. We don’t mind paying a decent amount of tax as long as it is spent on building great public services, and that certain areas of public infrastructure should be publicly owned. We believe our green spaces should be protected and that over-development is causing fundamental issues regarding the services we receive. We have an acceptance that business creates jobs and pays for the taxes that fund the services we all want, and so politics must create an environment to allow this to thrive; but there ought not to be excessive remuneration for those at the top.\nWhether this all makes us ‘left’ I don’t know, I’m not sure it matters. Our members are from across the political spectrum - from former Tory to former Green.\nIt works because we only really care about Southend as a whole - we’re just a Southend residents party, and it is Southend that drives all of our conversations, something I’d always thought Labour was there to do.",

My understanding is that ultimately central government have these powers, namely the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, which is currently the Rt Hon Angela Rayner MP. The Planning Inspectorate is also somewhere involved, and so I wrote to both to find out what actually can be done to stop all this because we are constantly told nothing can be (See appendix 1)\nSouthend Labour claim their move to build infrastructure first before allowing 10,000 homes on Bournes Green will help residents, but that makes no sense to me.\nWhat would help residents is if they stood up to their national Labour colleagues to fight with every power they do have to stop it. Instead, they are full steam ahead. The council may not own the land, but Labour are certainly not protecting it.\nI commend Councillors James Moyies, Stephen Aylen, Daryl Jones, Tony Cox and Daniel Nelson for putting together their motion to stop this new town being built on Bournes Green. However, now it has been voted down by Labour, Lib Dems and the ‘Independent Group’, that land is as vulnerable as it has ever been.\nIt is time for residents to raise their voices. Join the campaign to save our greenbelt at:\nThe arguments not to build 10,000 homes on this land have become well-trodden:\nDestroying wildlife (Cllr Hyde claimed she’s “putting nature first” with this development. Cannot remember concrete being all that beneficial!)\nIncrease in air pollution (whatever happened to Southend Labour’s ‘Climate Emergency Declaration’?\nTraffic gridlock\nMass overcrowding\nPoor infrastructure already in the town\nDebate highlights from the meeting\nCllr Moyies - Conservative, said that councillors voted not to build on the land but the next day an application was made by officers, which Cllr Cowan would have known about.\nCllr Cox - Leader of Reform UK Southend said:\n“The Leader [Cllr Daniel Cowan, Labour] has publicly claimed he was only following precedent set in 2018—but two wrongs do not make a right.” This is referring to Cllr Cowan’s reasoning/excuse that all he did was carrying on what was already in place instead of just ditching the idea entirely.\nCllr Cox questioned why Uttlesford District Council saw fit to call this in for scrutiny and debate, while this administration believed it was exempt.\nHe also stated that “Labour and the Lib Dems were fawning over themselves to oppose proposals to build on green belt land—like the Salvation Army site—but can’t wait to have their bellies tickled when it suits.” It’s a fair observation. What’s the difference between the sites? Why stand up for land outside of the council’s remit, but pro-actively carve up land in our own city?\nLabour, having reinstated Government housing targets, have decreed Southend must build another 23,000 by 2040, but as Cllr Cox points out, “This proposal won’t even count towards housing targets, which means more pressure to build on remaining green spaces.” This means that Southend will see another 33,000 houses swelling the population to an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 people. Can you imagine what that will do to our precious community?\nVery strange if true, Cllr Cox highlighted that the proposal directly impacts St Laurence ward (Cllr Cowan’s ward) and observed the secret squirrel nature in which it came about.\nBoth Green councillors were exemplary in their statements pointing out the numerous reasons not to destroy this land.\nCllr Daniel Cowan - Leader of Southend Labour and Southend City Council and his Labour, Lib Dem and Independent entourage are the reason this has all come about, but he was resolute in his defence.\nOne of his arguments is that the expression of interest for development had not just come from them—developers submitted their own. If they withdraw theirs, they would be handing control to developers who Cllr Cowan said “do not have this city’s best interests at heart.” I am sure Taylor Wimpey will be pleased to hear what the leader of Southend City Council thinks this about their organisation being that they will be partners. Nothing like an insult to forge good relations!\nHe claimed it is inevitable the land will be built on and so it is right to demand it be infrastructure-led.\nHe said “This administration is willing to stick our neck out there and say enough is enough, give us the roads and give us the hospitals.”\nAs Cllr Campbell pointed out, where is the guarantee? How many of us truly believe we are going to get a new hospital? If we cannot see a GP now or have to wait months or even years for operations with the infrastructure already in place, what naivety is required to believe this?\nIt is total fantasy and a con as far as I can see. If one day it happens I will of course eat many hats.\nBeing that the crux of his argument is make-believe why, then, would anyone back it?\nWithout irony, Cllr Cowan said that it was an “appalling motion” that was “manipulating the people of Southend” , and “shame on those willing to sell out our residents in this way.”\nI entirely disagree.\nThis was the motion:\n1) Ask the Chief Executive and Monitoring officer to carry out a full investigation into the\ndecision making process that allowed the expression of interest being sent in\nNovember 2018 and the proposal that was submitted in December 2024, and to\nrecommend changes to the constitution to ensure that in future there is full\ndemocratic oversight of key decisions.\n2) Ask the Cabinet to consider not proceeding with the proposal to build a new town,\nthat was submitted in December 2024, consisting of 10,000 homes on the Green Belt\nLand North of Bournes Green Chase.\n3) Request that the leader instructs officers to write to the New Towns taskforce to\nwithdraw the proposal and ask that it is no longer considered by the New Towns\nTaskforce as an appropriate location to present to Ministers when delivering their advice.\nPersonally, I do not feel manipulated or sold out. I think they are all perfectly reasonable asks and would have voted in favour.\nScratching for arguments he said “Many of you live in homes built on green belt land in the 1980s, yet now you want to pull up the drawbridge and deny future residents the same opportunity.” I just don’t think he understands there is a limit! We cannot just keep building because we always have. Let us not forget that there is no law that states Southend residents will get priority over new builds nor set a price that is even affordable. Perhaps the Leader can put it in writing that all Southend residents on the waiting list, and those that are waiting to be put on the waiting list, will ge guaranteed a home on this estate?\nHe finished by saying “this motion is a political stunt, an appalling attempt to mislead the people of Southend—and it’s the residents who will pay the price.”\nNo, Cllr Cowan, we will pay the price if you continually ignore the wishes of Southend residents. You are very fortunate it is a fallow year and there are no elections. You have a year to fix this until the 2026 local elections that you have not yet guaranteed to take place nor signed the petition to urge all councillors to do everything is their power to ensure they go ahead.\nThere are currently two e-petitions that we need your support on:\nThe first one is about stopping the cancellation of the 2026 local elections; https://democracy.southend.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=99&RPID=32847045&HPID=32847045.\nThe second is about saving our greenbelt next to Bournes Green: https://democracy.southend.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=102&RPID=32847059&HPID=32847059\nReferences\nAppendix 1\nLetter to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, which is currently the Rt Hon Angela Rayner MP.\nDear Rt Hon Angela Rayner\nRE: Objection to Proposed Development North of Bournes Green Chase, Bordering Southend and Rochford\nI am writing to formally raise my concerns regarding the proposed development on land north of Bournes Green Chase, which borders the boroughs of Southend-on-Sea and Rochford.\nThis land has long acted as a vital green buffer that helps preserve the distinct identities of our neighbouring communities. It provides ecological value, contributes to flood resilience, and holds important visual and environmental significance.\nThe scale of development currently being considered would fundamentally undermine these benefits, while placing unsustainable pressure on already stretched infrastructure — including roads, schools, GP services, and public transport systems.\nI am particularly alarmed that this land, understood locally to be protected from development, is now under review. I would appreciate your guidance on the following:\nOn what policy basis could development be permitted on land so closely aligned with greenbelt function and value?\nWhat statutory and public channels exist for residents, community groups, and local parties to formally challenge or halt this development?\nHow does your department weigh local democratic objections, environmental evidence, and long-term sustainability in such decisions?\nI write as both a concerned citizen and in my role as leader of the Southend Confelicity Party, a local political organisation formed by residents determined to protect the heritage, identity, and green spaces of Southend and its surrounding areas.\nComments made recently by the Leader of Southend City Council — who described the land as “just a load of low quality overworked agriculture fields which people can’t access anyway” — reflect a disturbing disregard for the value that our communities place on open land, regardless of accessibility or soil classification.\nUnless decisive action is taken at a national level, I fear the proposed 10,000-home development will proceed unchecked, leading to irreparable damage to our local environment and quality of life.\nI respectfully urge your office to investigate the status of this land, scrutinise any applications for development with due rigour, and ensure that proper public engagement is upheld throughout the planning process.\nPlease confirm receipt of this letter and advise if any intervention is being considered in this matter.\nYours sincerely,\nJames Miller\nLeader, Southend Confelicity Party",

With Confelicity’s modest increase in vote share, we now turn to the GE to spread our local message\n- James Miller\n- May 3, 2024\n- 6 min read\nUpdated: May 7, 2024\nSouthend Labour will be feeling very proud as they move ahead of the Tories with 20 playing 18.\nThey will may attribute this to their cunning 5 point plan and the mastermind(s) behind this will be patting themselves loudly on the back. Instead, I have a sneaky feeling it was a reflection of the national picture where the Tories are being chased out of house and home across the country. It has become a political massacre that sees Labour controlling councils in territories unheard of.\nNot many could have predicted this in 2019 when Johnson took an 80 seat majority. Yes, Truss has been made the scapegoat, but I believe the reason is more about the way they Shoe-horned Sunak in as Prime Minister. It felt wholly undemocratic - whether it was or not. And any goodwill left evaporated after that. Either way, I do not think Labour’s local success was about free bulky bin collections!\nThe Southend Tories may now only be the second largest party, but neither have the 26 councillors needed to form an administration.\nThey will both need to go out to those outside their parties and stitch together what they can. For Labour, there are widely spread rumours amongst Southend political enthusiasts that Cllr Cowan is held in such low esteem that no one will work with Labour if he remains the leader.\nWith the banishment of past Labour councillors executed and their replacements likely hand-picked, I cannot see how Cowan will be forced to relinquish his hold on the local party. With this being the case, Labour will have to pay a premium to have any of the other councillors on board and what that means for Southend is anyone’s guess.\nAs I said before the election, the Greens, albeit with the most visionary manifesto, have several polices such as LEZ, 20 mph speed limits across the entire city and the abolishment of grammar schools, that I am staunchly against.\nThe Independent Group have already won their 6-9pm seafront parking war, so we must assume cabinet positions await for them.\nPersonally, I believe Southend needs grounded, realistic policies, and I worry what a return to this coalition will bring.\nI will not repeat the highly questionable decisions the previous rainbow coalition took.\nAnd what of Southend Confelicity?\nAs the only Southend residents party in the city, you might think we will be quite an attractive proposition. However, transferring our positive local message has proven to be a challenging task.\nI am, of course, genuinely full of humility and gratefulness for the 1307 residents who found some kind of connection with Confelicity. I thank every single one of them, for whatever their reason, to put an X next to our name. I am also grateful for every contribution made by our members to make our party what it is today - whether that be guiding a debate in the right direction on a manifesto discussion, introducing new people to the party, sorting out all the paperwork or powering our leaflet team.\nOut of this election we have had new members join and the spirit and togetherness of our camp is only growing stronger. We have a wonderful group of people and it is a privilege to have been able to lead them. And our presence as a party is slowly getting there.\nOur new total actually represents a 13% increase from the year before, and an increase from 2.9% last year to 3.4% this year in the overall vote share. We also broke our record for the amount of individual votes in a ward, from 110 to 155 for Lee Clark in Kursaal. The previous record was also broken by Dean Eckett-Harris in Southchurch who won 151 votes. Roma, our candidate in Chalkwell, took part in hers and Confelicity’s first ever hustings to which she made us proud. On a self-absorbed note, I was particularly relieved to have received 80 votes, which was a 100% increase in my last year’s performance! I had mentioned to the Leigh candidates Jean (Lib Dem) and Stuart (Greens) if I surpassed 37 votes (I received 36 last time around) there would be a celebration in Leigh like never before! Well, I can’t promise a Sadiq Khan taxpayer funded firework spectacular, but all would be welcome for a cup of tea at Read on Sea!\nI have to tell you that before the night, I had grave concerns of losing our tiny slice of the voter’s pie, putting our entire existence into jeopardy. As much as I might have been able to make the right kind of excuses in my mind, had we lost our fairly meagre vote share I am not entirely sure how we might have gone on. So, to my relief we survived, and that was the most important aspect of last night.\nI had hoped to be around 3,000 in what is now our third year of existence, but I have been reticent in asking our brilliant candidates to do what needs to be done. Bear in mind none of them saw themselves as ever wanting a career in politics - they are with us purely to help our city improve. Their abilities, knowledge and experience will make them outstanding councillors, but the method in which to become a councillor - that is spending any free time convincing residents to vote for you - is not so straight forward.\nI am grateful for them being in the party and putting themselves forward to stand. It also takes a lot of guts to do this as it exposes yourself to some unwanted attention. And so, I must accept that progress will be much slower than I had originally hoped.\nIn any case, we always knew that it was the General Election that would put us on the map, and so the hope is we might see an upsurge afterwards and a far more positive result in the local elections in 2026.\nFor me, this is ok. I am content and hope we don’t raise our expectations beyond what we are capable of. Despite the presumptions of a few, we are not a party of money. We are only as rich as the candidates are prepared to give, so we compete on uneven turf.\nWhere we do compete is we have the raw materials that I really feel Southend residents could connect once they unearth us - the process will simply take a little longer.\nConfelicity will re-group as we set our new path in the coming weeks. All 51 councillors will be up for election in 2026, which gives us enough time to transform from a pub party into a real political force!\nOn a side-note, I would like to commend the convivial way everyone, from all parties, conducted themselves at the election night. We were all happily talking with each other regardless of the colour of our rosettes. For all the bad blood there may have been, none of that was on display throughout the night and into the early hours of 4am when we were finally released!\nThe General Election\nIn the immediate future I am proud to declare my candidacy for the General Election in Southend West and Leigh, and even prouder that I do so with my good friend, Lee Clark, who was recently selected in Southend East and Rochford. Fun fact: Lee and I sat next to each other at school when we were eleven years old, where we attended Thorpe Bay High School. I would never have thought we’d be running in a General Election together!\nFor those that know Lee, he is an outrageous personality with a heart of gold. He is definitely not a politician, but a genuine, funny and authentic guy. Neither us know the ways of the political sphere like the traditional parties, but as Southenders, like you, we feel the results of the decisions taken at Westminster.\nWe don’t need a think-tank or a group of researchers to tell us we do not have the infrastructure or public services to cope with the over-development of Southend, which at the same time is encroaching on our green spaces.\nWe already know our sea is suffering from sewage overflows, and our roads and pavements are in a poor state.\nBusiness and entrepreneurship are the keys to unlocking wealth creation and we would look forward to new ways to make this happen.\nOur local manifesto covers much of this already.\nOn some of the wider issues, I am disturbed by the wars we get ourselves entangled in. Our only aid should be in a peace-keeping capacity, if anything at all.\nImmigration must be addressed as we cannot cope with the influx of people, and that’s aside from the culture wars that are growing.\nWe know the NHS is struggling with demand, but what’s the solution? It’s obvious: pay more; employ more doctors and nurses and build more hospitals. But where’s the money to do this?\nWe definitely need transparency over where our money is going. The information is there, we need to demand to see it. How is it we are paying more than ever for less than ever?\nWe need to address the debt and deficit situation. We cannot keep paying billions of pounds in interest for the £2.5 trillion of national debt.\nLee and I do not come as saviours, but as facilitators to bring residents together to discuss ideas or issues and seek to resolve them. Change is not always good, but having a local party, whose leadership lives and works in Southend, has to be better than being governed by faceless strangers who have no interest in whether Southend gets better or not. With us, if you want something changed, you need only pop to Tesco or Adventure Island!",

We moved away to escape a toxic relationship and lived in the women's refuge who were amazing and gave us the support and love to grow.\nI grew up in the Kursaal Estate and though it may not have been easy, it was a place where I made a lot of friends. It's easy to write off this section of Southend, and when you hear what is said about the Kursaal Estate it can actually be hurtful to the people living there. I know there is a strong sense of community there because I was in it, and there are plenty of good people who want, like all of us, to be given the opportunity to do well in life. Yes, there are serious challenges there, but I will not write them off!\nI went to Hamstel Junior school for two years before going to The Thorpe Bay High School.\nWhen I left school I wanted to be an actor and to be honest I was stuck in a rut not knowing what to do next and struggled. I signed up for the Princess Trust programme which got me a job at Argos and whilst doing the Princess Trust I learnt about fundraising.\nIn 2006 I got a job in retail and since 2007 I've been fundraising whilst holding down a full time job and raising a family. I have helped raise hundreds of thousands of pounds over many years for which I thank every person who donated to causes close to my heart.\nMoney doesn't mean anything to me, just health, happiness and helping people.\nI'm now in my 17th year of fundraising and so far I've organised and participated in 197 fundraisers, raising money for 60 different charities with the current running approaching £400,000.\nI've taken part in the Brighton marathon, the national 3 peaks challenge, locked in a cage for 24 hours no food or drink, slept rough on the streets for 28 hours, quiz nights, charity fun days, Yorkshire 3 peaks. I run a charity football club (we are looking for a home pitch), and I am hoping to get in the London marathon this year. I have just returned from climbing Kilimanjaro, raising £16,000, and will be writing a book about it.\nI've lived in Southend for 30+ years and I love my time here and want to make it the best it can be. I am very hands-on and will try to help residents as much as I possibly can, whether that be reporting fly-tipping, writing to officers about run-down playgrounds in our parks to campaigning for decent living conditions with housing associations.\nI stood in the recent General Election for Southend East and Rochford and was proud to take Confelicity onto the national stage.
