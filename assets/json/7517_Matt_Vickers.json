This shocking omission leaves patients and hardworking NHS staff to struggle with outdated and inadequate facilities, while other regions benefit from much-needed investment.\nThe last Conservative Government gave unprecedented funding and investment in our Stockton’s NHS facilities, receiving £40m towards upgrading James Cook and North Tees hospitals with new radiology equipment and a new respiratory unit, £3m for a mental health crisis hub and a further £20m to deliver a brand new Diagnostic Hospital in Stockton Town Centre.\nThe lack of funding for Teesside comes despite the chancellor increasing spending by £70bn, partially funded by £40bn in tax rises hitting people across Teesside.\nUpon the news that North Tees Hospital have failed to receive additional funding, Matt Vickers MP said:\n\"Labour campaigned on the promise of investment and change, yet their first opportunity to deliver for the people of Teesside has resulted in a complete betrayal. Wes Streeting himself admitted that North Tees Hospital was not fit for purpose, yet his Government has turned its back on our community, giving Teesside nothing. This is a clear case of Labour saying one thing to get elected and doing the exact opposite once in power - they’re all fart and no poop. The people of Teesside deserve better, and I will continue fighting to ensure we get the funding our hospital desperately needs.\"\nMatt added: “The failure to provide funding for North Tees Hospital raises serious concerns about the Labour Government’s commitment to addressing regional healthcare inequalities and supporting frontline NHS staff. I think we need urgent clarity on the future of healthcare investment in Teesside and demands that the Government delivers on its pre-election promises.”",

Levelling up cash awarded by the last Conservative government continues to deliver for local people, but Labour must listen to residents about how they’d like to see the money spent.\nThe survey takes around 2 minutes to complete and residents can take part today by visiting mattvickers.co.uk/Yarm/.\nQuestions range from people’s views on Labour’s plans for new ‘rusty plant pots’ along the High Street, to the removal of parking spaces. There’s also huge concerns about the Labour authority’s plan to remove pontoons from the river side, making it more difficult for canoeists and free water swimmer to access the river but also making it harder for anyone in distress in the river to exit safely. Respondents will also be asked their views on the introduction of car parking charges to gauge opinion two months after charges were imposed by Stockton’s Labour Council.\nThe local MP has launched the survey after slamming the Council’s management of consultation of investment in Yarm, and many local people, businesses and councillors have shared their concerns with Matt.\nConservative Levelling Up cash has already delivered huge investment across Yarm, Stockton, Eaglescliffe and Billingham. This includes the recently opened Diagnostic Hospital, improvements to Preston Park, upgrades to Eaglescliffe train station, a new vocational training centre at NETA, and more.\nStockton’s Conservative MP Matt Vickers said:\n“I want to hear directly from local people about what they think of Labour’s plans for Yarm. My survey takes just a couple of minutes to complete, and everyone should take part to have their voice heard.\n“Since I was elected as your MP I’ve worked night and day to secure investment we need - but it is vital Stockton’s Labour Council spends that money on the improvements people want to see. This money could make a real difference if spent on things local people and business want to see for the town.\nLike me, many residents saw these proposals for the first time when they featured in the council’s press release. They’re not in any way in keeping with our beautiful town centre and I do wonder whether those who came up with them have even visited Yarm.\n“Let local people decide - not Stockton’s Labour Council!”\nOver the coming weeks, Matt will continue to work with residents, businesses and councillors to scrutinise what Labour’s plans mean for Yarm.",
  "https_www_mattvickers_co_uk_/https_www_mattvickers_co_uk_news_matt-vickers-mp-puts-pressure-labour-tackle-illegal-immigration/content_9.html": "This week in Parliament Matt Vickers MP put the pressure on the Labour government to get a grip of illegal immigration, with over 8,000 small boat arrivals having landed in the UK since Labour took office, and the government still having not appointed a head of its new border command.\nMatt Vickers MP said:\n\"With the other business going on in the House today, it seems apt to start by looking at the cost of illegal immigration. Asylum accommodation is costing the taxpayer over £8 million a day and now looks set to keep rising. We have seen this Government grant an asylum amnesty to 100,000 arrivals, without any proper costing in their impact assessment. Government is about priorities. This amnesty is seeing the Government pulling up a chair for people who have entered the country illegally, at the same time as turning off the heating for our pensioners.\n\"Journeys by small boat across the channel are illegal, dangerous and unnecessary. They are unfair on those who are in genuine need, and the country’s finite capacity is taken up by people coming into the UK from a place of safety in France. Furthermore, they are unfair on the British public, due to the huge impact that they have on public services.",
