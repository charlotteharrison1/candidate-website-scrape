I know crime needs some tough love. The Conservatives are the party of tough love. We offer the hard truth and can take the tough decisions to ensure Britain remains a strong, free, independent nation, with a committed and productive society.\nAnd as Conservatives we are delivering on Crime. Conservative policies have resulted in a country in which crime is down and falling, police officer numbers are at all time high and a plan is in place to review the funding formula for local police to improve their operations further.\nRecidivism is down from 32% to 24% since 2010 and violent crime and burglary down 40% while 90,000 knives have been taken off the streets. Funding for victim support services for sexual violence has quadrupled since 2010 and adult rape cases now have higher convictions with tougher sentences than under Labour.\nBut the work to reduce crime and improve the lives of victims does not stop. Jade’s Law, the Victims and Prisoners Bill will protect families from criminal spouses, and the Anti-Social Behaviour Action Plan is putting £160 million of funding to increase patrols in hotspot areas of anti-social behaviour.\nThere is no doubt that Conservatives care on Crime and the Conservatives deliver. Across the country since 2010 crime has fallen. Yet in Labour Police and Crime Commissioning areas crime has risen, including London.\nLondon is a proud city, and I am a proud Londoner. I’ve witnessed first hand assault after assault, and been in the firing line myself. I know the way this city is run needs to change. The havoc we know today is a tragedy. We’ve seen thefts up 31%, sexual offences up 43% and robberies up 58% since Sadiq Khan took office.\nIn Bermondsey I’ve witnessed phone thefts, and been told of many more examples by our concerned communities. Meanwhile Southwark has the third-highest rate of knife carrying in London – behind only Lambeth and Westminster.\nResidents like Amit agree with me that we need more police on our streets - something our Government is delivering, and something Susan Hall continues to champion.\nIf selected as your MP I will bring the Anti-Social Behaviour Action Plan to Bermondsey and Old Southwark. With your help we can make London, and Bermondsey and Old Southwark a safer place to be.",

As part of the esteemed South London and the Maudsley Trust, I help patients from South London as a medical doctor and hospital psychiatrist, and speak across the UK on how we can improve our health.\nMy political journey reflects a commitment to the community, fighting against the closure of GP practices, speaking up against antisocial behaviour, and standing twice for a local council seat. As an NHS doctor and part of the public sector workforce I know the good of government and public service, but I also know first hand the challenges of institutions and what needs to change.\nIn addition to my political and healthcare background, my experience as a business owner allows me to understand and speak to and up for the the aspirational entrepreneurs and businesses shaping our country's economy.\nMy track record includes successfully navigating challenging elections in South London and building lasting, positive teams. I love meeting the people, trying to understand their concerns better, in order to speak up for local voices that have gone unheard.\nMy unique blend of skills, including a scientific background, mental health expertise, and a commitment to free speech I am delighted to speak up for local people on the issues that matter from crime to housing and more.\nTogether we can make Britain a safer, cleaner and better place for us all.",

Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Dr Jonathan Iliff, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data. The Register of Electors that councils provide to authorised persons under the Representation of the People Act is also used for electoral purposes.\n5.

We ensure that our service providers comply with the same high standard that we do, and we store our data on the Bluetree servers in the UK.\n6. Special category data\nSpecial category data will be processed under the lawful basis indicated in section 3, as is permitted in clauses 22, 23 and 24 of schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act, covering political parties and elected representatives.\n7. Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Some service providers are located outside of the EEA and therefore it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. Where the transfer of your data outside of the EEA takes place we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if the data was inside the EEA, and it only occurs with your consent.\nWe will use one of the following safeguards to ensure this:\n• Where the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision determining that a non-EEA country or organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection.\n• A contract is put in place with the recipient of the data obliging them to protect the data to the same standards as the EEA.\nLegally it is not permitted to transfer certain types of data, such as Electoral Register Data, outside of the EEA, and we honour that obligation.\n8. Data retention policy\nPersonal data will be held for no longer than necessary. Some types of data may be held for longer than others. Typically the maximum retention is two election cycles. Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11. Data Rights\nAt any point you have the following rights:\n• Right of access – you have the right to request a copy of the information held about you.\n• Right of rectification – you have a right to correct data held about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.\n• Right to be forgotten – in certain circumstances you can ask for the data held about you to be erased from our records.\n• Right to object – you have the right to object to certain types of processing, such as direct marketing.\n• Right to object to automated processing, including profiling – you also have the right to be subject to the legal effects of automated processing or profiling.\n• Right to judicial review: if our office refuses your request under rights of access, we will provide you with a reason why.
