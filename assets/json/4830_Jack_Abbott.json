I know that we have so much potential here; from our beautiful waterfront to our award winning parks, and from our thriving arts and culture scene to our wonderful small businesses and entrepreneurs. I’m here to be ambitious for Ipswich, not to talk our town down. I will work with the Government to help regenerate our high streets and town centre, so we can kick on and fulfil Ipswich’s great potential.\nThe precondition to strong public services is a strong economy that works for working people. Yet from our NHS to our schools, and from our justice system to SEND provision, the Conservatives thoroughly gutted our public services. And the cost of living crisis over the past few years exposed the weakness of our economy after a decade of flatlining growth. Bills, mortgages, and the cost of the weekly food shop skyrocketed. Working people paid more to get less. I will push the Government to invest in and reform our public services and ensure the benefits of economic growth are felt right here in Ipswich.\nA Labour government- and only a Labour government- will ensure that working people in every community right across our country have the opportunities they deserve in life. Working people here in Ipswich have too often been an afterthought to politicians. But, to match the ambition that the Labour government has for our country, we need a strong local champion to speak up for our town. I want Ipswich and Suffolk to be at the heart of the energy transition, with all the opportunities for jobs and skills that brings. I want the next generation of kids in our town to grow up knowing that, thanks to a Labour government, they can realise their dreams if only they work hard enough for them."
