The UK tourism sector is greatly exposed to the lockdown and, with the summer season coming, the uncertainty is causing distress.\nThe sector learnt that it would be among the last to exit lockdown merely as an aside from the Minister for the Cabinet Office on “The Andrew Marr Show”. In contrast, President Macron outlined a strategy for the French tourism trade including flexible furlough, a 100% state-backed loan—not 80%—and state backing for postponed rather than cancelled holidays.\nOur system of refund credit notes can be expanded and extended to protect our domestic tourism industry. Did the Minister discuss those measures at the G20 meeting? What consideration has he made on introducing them?”\nNigel Huddleston, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state for Sport, Tourism and Heritage said “I congratulate the hon. Member on his first virtual appearance from the Opposition Front Bench. He raises many important issues.\nWe had a constructive conversation with the G20 tourism Ministers, primarily around the recovery programme. We are continuing the dialogue, both domestically and internationally, on all those issues. Of course, the tourism, hospitality and leisure sector has benefited from additional measures including business rate relief, and we will continue the dialogue with all stakeholders to ensure that the sector is looked after.”\nAfter the session Alex Sobel said on twitter “Parliament has been sitting in one form or another for over 700 years. But today was the first time an MP made their ‘despatch box’ debut virtually!\nGlad to have started as a Shadow Minister by breaking some new ground in the Virtual Parliament era speaking up for UK Tourism!”",

Many people are struggling or beginning to struggle, due to spiraling energy prices, increased fuel and food prices along with a huge rise in interest rates. The situation is looking like it will get worse, especially over winter with spiraling energy costs.\nRight now, millions of people, including young families and pensioners won't be able to afford to turn the heating on at all.\nI am disappointed in the level of support the government has offered to help with this situation and their refusal to look at further help until a new leader of the Conservative party has been selected. This Tory government seems content on letting giant oil and gas producers make huge profits whilst working people and pensioners suffer.\nFurther help should already have been announced so that the necessary work of updating relevant computer systems, such as the universal credit system could have begun.\nI am however pleased that Labour have announced our plans to help with the cost of living crisis and energy crisis. We would stop people’s energy prices going up by freezing the price cap which would save the average household around £1000. We would pay for this by taxing oil and gas producers on their excessive profits, getting rid of loopholes the Tories were happy to wave through. This plan will also bring inflation down, making future interest rate hikes less likely and easing the burden on households and businesses.\nBut we need to solve the energy crisis for good.\nIn Government we would insulate every home that needs it to get bills down with our Warm Homes Plan, after 12 years of wasted opportunities and failed schemes.\nAnd we’d get Britain off expensive foreign gas - by investing much, much more in home grown, cleaner energy such as solar, wind and hydrogen.\nThat is the only way to make sure we never again face an energy price crisis like this.\nI would say to all my constituents who are struggling to reach out to local community organisations.\nThere are many great ones such as Otley Action for Older People, OPAL, OWLS, and many more as well as our local foodbanks and citizens advice. These services offer a lifeline to people and will be the ones who are picking up the pieces after government inaction. My office is also available to anyone who needs urgent assistance. “",

It will be making contact with all applicants who were offered a home prior to lockdown to discuss their rehousing situation and make plans to undertake viewings and tenancy sign up where the applicant is able to do so. As there are 450 such cases it will take some time to do this. Where an applicant is not able to proceed because they are shielding or self isolating, the viewing and sign up will be put on hold. Resuming Choice Based Lettings on a reduced scale from Wednesday 24th June. For the first week only Council housing and Housing Association new build homes will be available, and then from the following week a small number of Council homes and Housing Association homes will be available and advertised. Housing will continue to increase numbers advertised each week pending any contractor capacity issues.\nIt maybe therefore a few months until we are able to fully resume Choice Based Lettings. All customers on the Leeds Homes Register will be contacted to advise accordingly and updated information will be available on the Leeds Homes website\nJob Retention and Self-Employment Income Support Schemes\nUp to 31st May 2020, 9,000 jobs had been furloughed through the Government’s Job Retention Scheme in Leeds North West constituency, equivalent to around 15% of the population aged 16-64. This compares to 21% that have been furloughed in the UK.\nA further 2,300 claims were made to the Self Employment Income Support scheme, equivalent to 72% of the potentially eligible population. This compares to a take up rate of 70% of the potentially eligible population in the UK as a whole.\nClaimant Count\nThe May 2020 figures for the unadjusted claimant count have been published today, which show the number of people who were claiming unemployment related benefits. This includes those who were claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance, or were claiming Universal Credit and are required to seek work. Unlike the alternative count (see below) the unadjusted count is not adjusted to take into account the roll-out of Universal Credit.\nThere were 2,465 actual claimants in Leeds North West constituency in May 2020, which was 4.1% of the population aged 16-64. The equivalent UK claimant rate was 6.4%.\nThis was 570 higher than April 2020 and 1,435 higher than March 2020, before the UK lockdown began.\nThere were 610 claimants aged 18-24 in May 2020, 175 higher than April 2020 and 385 higher than March 2020\nTest and Trace\nLeeds will receive just over £4.1m for Test and Trace, our share of the £300m that was announced on 22 May. This will help with the additional capacity we need to deal with the complex cases and with communication and engagement work that we know is going to be important.\nThe Government have released the first set of data from NHS Test and Trace. The data covers the first 7 days of operation shows: 67% (5,407) of the people who had tested positive for coronavirus were reached by contact tracers and asked to share details of their close contacts and 85% (26,985) of close contacts were reached and advised to self-isolate.\nWe know that, if implemented as intended, Test and Trace is likely to reduce infection rates by about 15%. If combined with behavioural measures like hand washing and social distancing, however, this will have a much greater impact.\nFilm the House – opportunity for filmmakers\nThe Film the House competition for 2020 has now launched – if you’re a student or independent scriptwriter, director or filmmaker take a look at www.filmthehouse.co.uk for more details about this parliamentary-based competition.\nFilm the House is a parliamentary‐based short film competition for student and independent filmmakers based in the UK.\nAll entries are shared with your local MP and the final judging of the competition is carried out by industry professionals.\nFind out more about how to get involved at www.filmthehouse.co.uk",

The First operated bus - which runs between Whinmoor and Moor Grange - changed its route in February, omitting the Queen’s Road stop from its route.\nResidents, who were not consulted on the changes, argued that the plans would make life more difficult for elderly and disabled people and would negatively impact local businesses.\nAlex Sobel actively worked with Leeds City Council who mandated the reinstatement of the original route.\nHe said: “A number of constituents wrote to me to express their concern about the changes to the 56. I contacted both First and Leeds City Council to reflect these worries and was pleased that Leeds City Council took decisive action on the matter.”\nThe move has also been welcomed by local business owners, including the owner of Brudenell Social Club, Nathan Clark: “I’m happy that our local MP and Leeds City Council have taken on board the concerns raised to them by myself, other local business owners and residents in Hyde Park and have worked together to find a solution. Enforcing the changes from First shows that our local politicians are serious about looking after local businesses and residents.’\nThe 56 bus will resume its original route in September.",

It is unclear, however, why services cannot be run remotely and there have been several reports of staff being made to come in who do not fall into that category.\nThe letter request that “the Government clearly define who are and who are not key workers. We do not believe that those in the telecommunications industry, other than those who deal with emergency response, should be defined as key workers.”\nThey go onto say there should be “serious questions” raised with industry leaders abou “why they could not run operations and call centres remotely and why they had no systems in place to do so in the event of a national emergency.” “These organisations are some of the wealthiest in the United Kingdom. We have seen much smaller firms, creatively redesigning their systems to allow for home working.”\nThe letter says that it should be Government not organisations themselves that define who are and who are not essential staff.\nFurther Quotes\nAlex Sobel said, “I have received several complaints from constituents who do not believe their work to be essential. They have worked for several organisations including Capita and Lloyds bank. We need every organisation large and small to do all they can to enact the social distancing measures set out by Government this week. I do not know why these organisations have not had contingency measures in place, long before this crisis.”\nKarl Turner said: \"The Government needs to make it crystal clear exactly who should and shouldn't be going to work. Despite the vast majority of businesses going above and beyond to do the right thing, a small number are unnecessarily putting lives at risk by falsely claiming key worker status. Vague advice creates a vacuum, which sadly some seem to be exploiting.\"\nThe MPs to have signed are Hilary Benn MP Olivia Blake MP Paul Blomfield MP Tracy Brabin MP Richard Burgon MP Gill Furniss MP Fabian Hamilton MP Emma Hardy MP Diana Johnson MP Holly Lynch MP Rachael Maskell MP Ed Miliband MP Stephanie Peacock MP Rachel Reeves MP Naz Shah MP Alex Sobel MP Karl Turner MP",

This includes those who were claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance or were claiming Universal Credit and are required to seek work.\nLeeds North West has 1905 actual claimants – 3.2% of the working age population. This is more than double the number of same month in the previous year which stood at 810. The leap is higher still for those aged between 18 and 24 who are seeing a 277% jump from last year.\nThe MP for Leeds North West has urged caution with the numbers as they do not take into account the roll out of Universal Credit but he does say the numbers should be ‘of great concern’ to the Government.\nHe said, “These numbers are stark and each one represents individuals and families who are struggling to make ends meet. I have been very supportive of the furlough and self-employed schemes which are helping a great many people, but there are many who are falling through the gaps and I hear from them every day.\nThis could include seasonal workers, workers who have recently changed employers or those who’s employers have chosen not to take up the schemes. The 18-24 numbers are particularly concerning as they are represented much more highly in occasional, casual or zero-hours jobs.\nIf the Government do not get this right, we face a lost generation of young people who have been cast adrift in the midst of this crisis. Whilst these numbers do not account for UC rollout, they will be of great concern to my constituents and should be of great concern to the Government. ”",

A Private Members bill, brought by Labour MP Jim McMahon, will go before the house on Friday 3rd November.\nAlex Sobel, MP for Leeds North West said “ I have long been a supporter of reducing the voting age but in the wake of Brexit, now is the time to reinvigorate our democracy and give young people a say in how we shape our country.”\n“16 is not an arbitrary age. Todays 16 year olds are the new Citizen generation. The uptake in the National Citizens Service means that 16 and 17 year olds are engaged fully with the community. They can also work, pay taxes and serve our country within the armed forces. A sixteen-year-old’s passport will recognise them as an adult. Now is the time for our democracy to catch up and give them the right to vote.”\n“The Scottish referendum showed us that when you empower young people, they will turn out as 75% of 16 and 17 year olds did in that vote three years ago. Scottish politicians of all parties are now in support of this bill.”\n“We need to support young people and rebalance our political system to engage and empower them. Giving 16 and 17 year olds the vote will mean that politicians will have to start listening to young people and the issues that affect them most be that housing, university fees or employment opportunities.”\nMore information\nLeeds North West had an electorate of 68,152 in GE2017. With 16 and 17 year olds included that would rise to 69,193- an increase of 1,460.\nOn Friday 3rd November the 2nd Reading of Jim McMahon’s Private Members Bill will be debated to reduce the voting age to 16. The Bill will also include a requirement on Returning Officers to ensure reasonable steps are taken to register new voters and a requirement on schools to provide education on democracy and citizenship.\nThe Votes at 16 campaign was launched in January 2003 by a coalition of political parties, pressure groups and charities. The UK Youth Parliament is a supporter of the Votes at 16 campaign and calls for the reduction in voting age in its manifesto.\nIn June 2015 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) passed the Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting Age) Act which enabled 16 and 17 year olds to vote in elections in Scotland.\nThe National Assembly for Wales is to be given the power to lower the voting age for its elections.\nThe Wales Bill 2016-17, currently before Parliament, will make provision for this.",

The law requires pets to be bred and reared in a safe environment and sold from their place of birth in a bid to stamp puppy farming and deter puppy smugglers.\nThe legislation is named after Lucy, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who died in after being made to give birth to repeated litters of puppies on a puppy farm in Wales. The ‘Lucy’s Law’ e-petition calling for an end to the practise - which removes puppies from their mothers and creates “sick, traumatised, dysfunctional dogs” - received nearly 150,000 signatures. In response, the government issued a Call for Evidence, followed by a consultation which closed in September 2018, with overwhelming support for a ban on the third-party sale of puppies and kittens.\nAlex Sobel, who spoke up in Parliament on a number of occasions in support of the law, said: “I’m so pleased that this hard-fought campaign has finally come to fruition. We are a nation of animal lovers and heartless breeders have exploited that for far too long. Most prospective pet owners are unaware of the suffering that can go on behind the scenes on puppy farms and so I’m delighted that these cruel puppy farms will no longer be allowed to exist.”\nFrom next April it will be illegal for anyone to sell puppies and kittens in England unless they are the breeder. The law will also ensure animals are not removed from their mothers after birth.",

Finding new ways to encourage people to ‘go electric’ could be key in solving the problem and in an address to MPs across the House Mr Sobel said:\n“I represent a constituency with no public electric vehicle charge points… I want to use the debate to make public, ideas that I have put to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and that I now put to the Department for Transport”.\nHe went on to detail six recommendations for the relevant departments to consider which would help constituencies like Leeds North West improve it’s air quality. Mr Sobel suggested an increase of matched funding to help local authorities install residential charge points which would enable many more people to make full use of electric vehicles.\nThe installation of electric vehicle charging points should also be regulated, to ensure new homes, offices, commercial spaces and retail areas are able to support the demand for electric charging points. This would be monitored alongside ensuring three-phase power supplies are included in new building plans, making it easier and more environmentally friendly to provide charge points.\nMr Sobel also took the opportunity to address barriers to transport which will occur when Leeds implements a clean air zone next year. He suggested that a grant scheme to help with the purchase of electric vehicles be trialled in areas implementing the clean air zone.\nMr Sobel used the example of free electric vehicle parking that exists in Leeds City Centre to encourage the Government to engage more people in the benefits of electric vehicles.\nSimilarly, a business levy on parking spaces would encourage companies to take more responsibility in tackling air pollution. Mr Sobel suggests a levy on car parking spaces which are not electric vehicle accessible to incentivise local businesses and employees to consider the transition to electric cars and bikes.\nMr Sobel’s final suggestion focussed on planning permissions and ensuring that electric vehicle parking spaces and charging points are necessary for all new builds, he said: “We should… legislate to ensure that all UK car parks with more than 50 spaces must have a minimum of one EV space per 25 spaces”.\nThe Government’s proposals to tackle climate change and introduce better alternatives to petrol and diesel transport options are due to be implemented by 2040. Alex Sobel MP, urged these proposals to be brought forward in a timely manner to ensure the safety of constituents living in dangerous levels of poor air quality and swiftly tackle the international problem of climate change.",

I firmly believe in a society where everyone can lead a life that feels true to them. The right to self-determination is essential for freedom, safety and privacy.\nThe purpose of the Supreme Court decision is to supposedly provide clarity, and whilst the independence of our judiciary is fundamental, so far we have only had confusion. There is a real feeling of fear that has far-reaching consequences for anyone who is marginalised - including trans men and women, non-binary and gender queer people, and intersex people. The ruling also creates endless uncertainty for staff in hospitals, shelters, hostels, retail, hospitality and other settings who will be left to police the effects of this court decision.\nWe have already seen the British Transport Police state that when strip searches are required, trans women would be searched by male officers. This is not just deeply troubling and problematic but, in my opinion, an overreach of the ruling.\nCampaign Groups in favour of the ruling have stated publicly that the court decision makes navigating single sex spaces '[Trans peoples] problem'. This implicitly rejects minority rights. Making this a problem for trans people alone to resolve will not provide a solution and is no way for a progressive society to act.\nImagine a space that you have occupied for decades is no longer available for you. We already know that trans people are at a disproportionally higher risk of hate crimes, discrimination, murder, domestic abuse, suicide and poorer health outcomes. This does not elevate women's rights, it just pushes trans people into further harm.\nWe need a steadfast defence for our trans community, who are ordinary people trying to live their lives. I am a firm believer of self determination, self ID and allowing all to live their lives as long as they do not cause harm to others. Our manifesto was clear that we must protect the freedom for people to explore their sexual orientation and gender identity.\nWe need to stick to our manifesto commitment to modernise, simplify, and reform the intrusive and outdated gender recognition law to a new process. We must remove indignities for trans people who deserve recognition and acceptance.\nOur trans community are telling me, as their representative, that they are frightened as the state and its services are excluding them. We need to strive for a society with equality of access and services and provides for everyone’s fundamental rights, not one which excludes a minority group.\nWe need to ensure that trans people are treated with respect, and that everybody is given dignity in their everyday lives. Trans people deserve to be treated with care and compassion which is not the case in the political discourse or society. I will continue to be an ally and deeply care about trans people.",

What the nation was looking for was clarity and consensus. The statement raises more questions than answers.\nFor example, what safety provisions are businesses meant to put in place and by when?\nHow are police meant to enforce these provisions where people are being given unclear advice?\nWill the Government be publishing the medical and scientific advice that has informed these decisions?\nThis was not helped this morning by Dominic Raab on BBC Radio Four who seemed as confused by the detail of the announcement as the rest of us.\nThe Government have just released their guidance and I will be going through that to provide better information in time for tomorrow’s update. I worry about the great many of my constituents who will now be asked to return to work in potentially unsafe environments.\nCases and Mortality\nAs of 9am on the 6 May the Government has tested 1,072,144 people, of whom 201,101 tested positive. As of 5pm on 5 May, of those who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, 30,076 have died – an increase of 649. But indicators suggest the numbers of deaths and infections continue to remain on a downward trend. Locally, as at 6pm on 6 May the number of confirmed cases within Leeds stood at 1,555, with 21 new cases yesterday. The total number of reported deaths of people who tested positive with COVID-19 in Leeds hospitals up to 5pm 6 May is 265.Please note that all hospital deaths are confirmed by testing but not all community and care home deaths will have had a confirmatory test. Of the 483 covid-19 related deaths registered so far, 471 (98%) were Leeds residents, 281 (58%) were in hospitals, 173 (36%) were in care homes and 9 (2%) in a hospice. To date, 34% of all deaths registered have been covid-19 related.Our thoughts continue to be with all those affected by this virus, particularly those grieving loved ones.\nVolunteering\nI wanted to share with you some of the positive work that has been taking place with volunteers through Voluntary Action Leeds. The work that LCC and VAL have done has been hugely positive. As well as the role of VAL, civic leadership from councillors has been important in securing the success of this volunteering up to now. Leeds has had a very diverse range of people volunteering, who have brought with them valuable language skills. Over 2,000 people have identified they can speak more than one language and a significant number are interpreters. Leeds City Council has been able to share the details of 600 verified drivers with volunteering hubs. Looking beyond the current response phase, LCC is reopening the online Volunteer Centre. In the next few weeks, we know that some people will be returning to work. We hope that the city can continue to enjoy the incredible response we’ve had to Leeds’ call for local volunteers.\nFunerals\nI recieved the below message from Leeds City Council regarding funeral services. I am in touch regularly with funeral providers as well as the relevant council members and staff on this issue.\n“One measure has been a limit on the number of mourners that are able to attend a funeral which has been set at ten for both burials and cremations. This is consistent with regulations from Public Health England which state that only members of a household should be attending a funeral or close family members and if no close family members, then a close family friend may attend. We have also had to stop services within our crematoria chapels due to the large number of cremations we are having to process at the current time which last week saw 162 in total. Over the course of the last few weeks we have seen the number of deaths in Leeds being as high as 124% higher than they were in the same week in April 2019. We have now had at least five consecutive weeks where the number of deaths has been significantly higher than the same week in 2019. To confirm this in April 2019 we had 558 deaths registered in Leeds whilst in April 2020 that figure was 1048 deaths.\nWith cremations taking place as frequently as every 30 minutes in some cases, but on average every 40 minutes, it is not possible to provide a deep cleanse and sanitise between services that would be necessary to provide a safe environment in accordance with Public Health England requirements. Opening up the chapel areas would also entail the consideration of opening up other areas such as the music, waiting, vestry rooms and toilets, all of which would also require a deep cleanse and sanitisation between use.\nWhilst the headlines suggest that we are over the current peak of Covid-19 deaths, the funeral process takes place over a number of weeks after death and, therefore, we are expecting high numbers for a few more weeks.\nWe have been working closely with funeral directors to offer other options to bereaved families including using a Funeral Director’s own chapel if they have one; making arrangements with a family’s local place of worship; or, using a different venue entirely. We are aware that some have held a service in their own homes, where the footfall is much less and the risk of infection is reduced, and some families have used sports clubs and similar function rooms in other venues to hold a service. Some families, have also decided to wait for a service until after the burial or cremation has occurred in the hope that more people will be able to attend once the restrictions have been lifted.\nAs we have mentioned previously, we are aware that some families may wish to attend the crematoria grounds and view the coffin being moved from the hearse into the chapel for a short period of time and mourners are invited to do so provided that, no more than ten people attend. Social distancing of two metres between people must be maintained at all times. Some families have also asked their officiant to do a short blessing outside of the crematoria chapel in view of the bereaved family rather than do it inside.\nGiven the above, and whilst the existing government advice remains in place and the number of cremations remains high, we will need to maintain these arrangements.\nWe are keen to re-introduce chapel funeral services as soon as it is safe to do so. Our decision on this will be informed by ongoing monitoring of the number of cremations we are averaging per week and when this reduces to a normal level that allows sufficient time between cremations for the necessary deep cleanse and sanitisation we will consider their safe re-introduction. ”",

We do have empty beds thanks to the work of community and social care colleagues on discharges. Plans are still underway on staffing for Nightingale, which is being staffed from across the region. Testing capacity has been increased in LTHT to include testing for a small number of staff, but not yet the magnitude needed.\nPersonal Protection Equipment\nI have been in contact with a local Hospice who are struggling to get any Personal Protection Equiptment (PPE) whatsoever.\nWhat we know is the following:\nPPE very short, care homes and hospices are not getting any at all directly.\nAll PPE coming in is placed with the NHS. Local resilience forum are not handling any.\nHospices are chasing PPE suppliers constantly spending far too much time. They have to either go cap in hand to the NHS (who are also very short but who do in Leeds try to help where they can) or chase private suppliers who are short in supply and prices are going up steeply.\nLeeds City Council have received 10k masks from Hangzhou as a twinned city and Leeds and Bradford are trying to get order from China where they can.\nIt is completely unacceptable that we are into the second week of April and vital care services and hospices are not able to protect their staff and patients for lack of provision. Care providers and hospices have to go cap in hand to the NHS and our local authorities have to go cap in hand to foreign governments. These are not complicated pieces of equipment to manufacture. Our Government is simply not providing the standard of care to our care workers and their patients at this time of crisis.\nDentists\nI have had several dentists and dental staff writing to me. Many of them are on the verge of bankruptcy and require urgent help from the Government. The Government has not included dentist clinics in critical business saving measures. This has caused serious financial problems for many practices in my Leeds North West.\nI have written to the Chancellor on this. I have called on him to extend business rate extensions given to retail to dental practices. I also called on him to allow endangered dental practices to access the £25,000 grants the Government has offered for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses. I also called for urgent clarification on insurance, job retention and support for self-employed dentists.\nSupport for Students\nI have been very concerned with the lack of support for students in these difficult times.\nI ask students who have concerns about rent on contracts please contact Leeds University Union who I have been liaising with constantly. They are advising for those who have not signed a contract for next year to not do so until this crisis is over.\nI have also been in contact with student halls and landlords. Some accommodation providers have behaved with great community spirit. Unite has released students from their contracts free of charge. However some private landlords are not showing the same flexibility.\nI have been proud to support the NUS campaign for student renters with the following demands. Firstly landlords must stay updated and implement public health guidance in all their properties. Secondly every student Landlord must offer a no-penalty early release from tenancy contracts. Thirdly landlords must end rent arrears and no fault evictions. Fourthly all renters impacted by COVID-19 must have their rent suspended or significantly reduced.\nSome useful links:\nLeeds Women’s Aid\nLeeds Women’s Aid are trialling an online chat facility in case of an increase in abuse during the lock down.

On June 9th 2017, Mr Sobel swept to victory sealing 44.1% of the vote - a majority of 4,224.\nSince then he has set out his stall to be ‘an MP for everyone, routed in the community’ as well as being ‘Leeds North West’s voice in Parliament.’\nMr Sobel couldn’t have taken over at a more fraught time for the country, with the Brexit issue causing deep divides in the nation, dominating the political landscape. Whilst Alex has stood strong on this issue, voting and debating according to the red lines he set out during his election, he has been keen to make his mark on issues beyond Brexit.\nClimate change is the issue in which he feels the most passionate. He has been nominated both years for the Greenest MP award as well as taking his seat on Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee. He has addressed global problems, highlighting the scourge of plastic pollution including embarking on a plastic free week, and driving forward the climate emergency in Parliament. He has also been a local voice on Leeds’ issues with Air Quality and pushing forward public transport, holding big train and bus companies to account.\nDespite his busy Parliamentary schedule and ambitious agenda, Alex is most at home in Leeds North West, where he lives with his young family. Alongside his award-winning team*, Alex has completed over 10,000 pieces of casework and has conducted 194 surgeries. He is seen frequently at public events and works closely with local community groups and local campaigns on issues across the constituency.\nAlex puts great weight on bridging the divide between Parliament and his constituents. He has highlighted the issue of school cuts in the chamber, quoting directly from a survety of schools and parents in the constituency. He has also had over 700 Parliamentary written questions answered, many of which are submitted on behalf of constituent concerns.\nMr Sobel said “It has been the greatest privilege of my life serving my home constituency in Parliament. I will continue to work as hard as I can to make Parliament work for my constituents and to give them a voice at this hugely turbulent time for the country. Thank you to everyone in the community who have been so supportive over the past two years.”\n*Caseworker Natalie Wells Russell won the 2018 Parliamentary Staffer of the Year",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_coronavirus-update-friday-17th-april-2020/content_515.html": "Coronavirus update Friday 17th April 2020\n- Alex Sobel\n- Apr 17, 2020\n- 3 min read\nI would like to start by expressing my sadness at the news of Norman Hunter’s passing. This news is made only more tragic in the context of the 13,000 people who have now lost their lives to Coronavirus in the UK. We must keep our resolve, persist with the lockdown for as long as it is necessary to contain this virus.\nPPE update\nI put out a call recently for anyone who may be making or able to acquire PPE to get in touch with my office. We are also in touch with the Care Homes, hospices and GP surgeries in our communities to make sure we understand the level of need and key concerns throughout this crisis. Yesterday, we received boxes of PPE from a variety of sources, including many thousand facemasks from a businessperson who trades with Vietnam. My neighbours Simon and Emma and I spent yesterday afternoon delivering the PPE to the care homes and hospices who we know are struggling. Much of today will be spent doing the same thing.\nWhilst it feels good to be helping the community directly, it would be a lot better if the systems supposedly put in place by Government worked and that there is enough supply of PPE to protect our most vulnerable people.\nFurlough\nIt seems the celebrations outlined in yesterday’s update were premature. Whilst it is good that the Government has brought forward the start date needed to qualify for the scheme, there is a caveat in place stating that new staff must be actually on the payroll on said date which has not provided relief to many people paid monthly. I will continue to push for fixes to ensure that nobody falls through the gap.\nLockdown\nThe Foreign Secretary set out the criteria that would have to be met for any lockdown easing:\n1) Evidence that the NHS can cope across the UK\n2) A sustained fall in daily death rates\n3) Evidence that the rate of infection is decreasing\n4) Confidence that supplies of testing and PPE are able to meet demand\n5) No risk of a second peak\nThe first three sets of criteria are straightforward to measure. Criteria 4 and 5 are a little vaguer and require a degree of interpretation. The extension of the lockdown is clearly necessary, and we must all stick to it in order to save lives and expediate the end of the crisis. I would like to hear more about how the Government intend to supply confidence of testing and PPE as well as the measures needed to reduce the risk of a second peak once lockdown is over.\nTesting for Care Homes\nThe Government will test all symptomatic care home staff and residents. In Leeds testing facilities have always been in place for symptomatic residents. The infection control team have been testing in care homes but it is yet unclear exactly how the national testing system for residents will operate.\nAdmission appeals for school places\nThe Department for Education has published guidance on the coronavirus in regard to impact on school admission appeals. Coronavirus will impact authorities on the ability to carry out admission appeals. But, parents must continue to have the right to appeal to any school which has refused their child a place. The Government will make regulatory changes that will that will relax some of the current requirements. This will enable admission authorities to proceed with their admission appeals. We expect the regulations them to come into force on 24 April 2020. The regulations will be time-limited and will expire on 31 January 2021. DfE will publish guidance to support admission authorities and local authorities to support in carrying out admission appeals over the coming months.",

This has meant that parents who were previously paying £37.80 per month will now have to pay £50.\nAfter receiving a raft of constituent correspondence, Alex contacted the combined authority asking them to reconsider the “sharp and sudden increase.”Whilst the increase will still happen, the combined authority has now agreed to keep the subsidy until 20th April.\nAlex Sobel said “I am pleased that the subsidy has been kept in place in the short term to allow for parents to make other choices and prepare for the price increases. I am still following up with the authorities to ensure that school bus passes are fully transferable to other public transport.”\n“Obviously, we do not want to see price increases at all which add to the already substantial financial burden that parents have to bare at the moment. This serves to highlight the impact of Government cuts at community level and that this Conservative Government are not working for people here in Leeds City region.”",

Officers from the Parks and Countryside Department will be there to help the group set a constitution.

The journey took them around cars parked on pavements, street works, crossings, uneven pavements and street furniture.\nFollowing the guided Mr Sobel said: “It has been a humbling experience to learn first-hand what Guide Dog owners have to go through every day. Something as simple as walking down the local high street became a huge challenge. Thankfully I had Star there to keep me safe! I want to thank Guide Dogs and the service users I met for taking the time to talk to me about their experiences and what is an important political issue.”\nAfter the walk Alex spoke in depth with local guide dog owners with in his constituency about their experiences and how it had felt to navigate around Leeds busy streets.\nGuide dog owner Joan spoke to Alex about her first hand experienced and the challenges that cars illegally parked on pavements can cause. She said “Cars parked on pavements are a real problem where I live, and especially for me. People often park on the pavements without any thought for how anyone is going to get past without walking on the road. It’s very dangerous.”\nDebbie Linford, Engagement Officer at Guide Dogs UK said, “The aim of today is to highlight to Alex the difficulties people with sight loss face in our community.\nParking on the pavement can be extremely dangerous. Drivers may not always realize, but cars parked on the pavement put people with sight loss and other vulnerable pedestrians in danger. Imagine being forced to step out into a busy road because the footpath is blocked especially when you can’t see. We know the problem can be so bad that people with sight loss simply don’t leave the house to do all the things others take for granted.”\nThe charity Guide Dogs for the Blind is calling for nationwide law to end inconsiderate and unnecessary pavement parking and would like the Government to make pavement parking a clear offence, except where there is an exemption in place from the local council.\nIf you would like to discover more about Guide Dogs and help us to change the lives of people who are blind or partially sighted, please visit: www.guidedogs.org.uk/supportus",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_coronavirus-update-tuesday-14th-april/content_519.html": "Coronavirus update Tuesday 14th April\n- Alex Sobel\n- Apr 14, 2020\n- 3 min read\nI would like to start by thanking you for your continued discipline and dedication to the lockdown effort. On what was a very warm Easter weekend the lockdown seemed to be very well observed. The news from our hospitals continue to be grim and it was confirmed last night that 11,329 people in the UK have now died from COVID 19. Whilst there will be an official review into the lockdown measures this week, it is very unlikely that we will see a relaxing of any measure imminently. I realise that for many people this is a hugely difficult time and I would like to remind you that my office is here for anyone that needs help.\nPPE\nI have written extensively about the lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) which is particularly acute in the care sector. Last week, I highlighted the problems within hospices and in particular the Wheatfield’s hospice in Headingley\nThere is a critical shortage of PPE. Although Dominic Raab talks about the ‘bulk drop’ to local resilience forums, there have been too few making it to the care sector- particularly for those who usually rely on commercial supply chains. Nationally, there are now 92 care homes in which covid-19 has been detected. This will increase exponentially if we do not urgently address this problem and ensure adequate PPE for the care sector\nTesting is another huge issue. We are currently operating at around one fifth of our end of April target. Testing could be the difference between a case of coronavirus in a care home being successfully managed or resulting in an unstoppable outbreak.\nPolice\nThere is a freephone, 24-hour National Domestic Abuse Helpline 0808 2000 247\nThat said, the Police have been clear that this is not the time for abusers to get away with it and they are continuing to act on instances of crime and arrest those who commit it. If you are suffering from or have been witness to domestic violence, please call 999 if it is safe to do so and the police will attend.\nWhilst the new hotline is a welcome step, there needs to be real cross government collaboration to support this sector and this should include ring-fencing some of the Chancellor’s recently announced charity funding to support domestic abuse services and the wider violence against women and girls sector.\nLabour will be speaking with organisations from across the sector next week and work with them to see what more is required to keep some of the most at risk people in our communities safe throughout this crisis.\nThe police have been enforcing lockdown locally. I would ask that residents continue to obey the lockdown rules in order to reduce the amount of police resource needed and to keep the infection rate as low as possible.\nForeign office\nMy office is continuing to assist those trapped abroad. Whilst there has been some funding for flights there still remains some very big problems. Phonelines are overwhelmed and it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to access accurate or helpful information. There is a disparity between some embassies and others and information about flights is patchy. Some airlines are charging vast sums of money for flights home and some are refusing to reimburse passengers for cancelled flights leaving them fearful of booking others.\nThe Government must charter flights where necessary, regardless of cost. They must establish clear MP liaison arrangements so that we can continue to effectively assist our constituent.\nMy staff team and I have been liaising with the Foreign office. We have also raised concerns with the new Shadow Foreign Secretary, Lisa Nandy, who has put these concerns directly to Dominic Raab.\nParliament\nThe leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg says parliament will return on 21 April “to fulfil its essential constitutional functions.” I believe that this should only be done subject to the medical advice at the time. MPs cannot be responsible for further spread of coronavirus, particularly when there are technological solutions available.\nVaccinations for all\nI signed a letter coordinated by the All-Party Group on Vaccines. It called on the Prime Minister to take steps to support health technology. The letter called on the Prime Minister to impose public interest conditions on funding for a vaccine. This includes ensuring the vaccine is affordable to ordinary members of the public. It also called for a World Health Organisation global resource pooling mechanism and to issue crown licenses to upscale production of COVID battling products.",

A North Leeds businessperson who trades with Vietnam managed to procure and supply 5000 facemasks; a department of Leeds University has gathered in PPE supplies from Chinese students whose families have sent over masks to help; a couple with links to a paragliding company in Austria provided gowns; and individuals have produced visors working from workshops.\nAlex said “It was frustrating waiting for the Government to act, and too often the supply chains to the care sector were jammed or have fallen apart all together. The famed ‘bulk drops’ to resilience forums have not ended up with the care sector getting the PPE they need.\nSo we thought we would act ourselves, asking the public for donations. We have had a brilliant response. We have been donated facemasks from a businessperson who trades with Vietnam, surgical PPE from students at Leeds University, gowns from an Austrian paragliding business and visors made by local people.\nWe are in constant communication with our care homes, GPs and hospices and have delivered thousands of pieces directly and continue to do so. It is disappointing that we are having to do the work of a responsible Government.”\nSimon Rix said “It is a pleasure working with Alex and it feels good in these times to be doing something proactive and positive. We have had lots of deliveries and the facilities we go to are clearly grateful for the help. We will keep going while there is a need for our help but I hope the Government comes through soon.”\nAlex has also spent much of this week helping Otley foodbank with their deliveries.",

The closures of London and Whipsnade Zoos have meant ZSL, the international conservation charity behind the Zoo, has lost out on £26million of income.\nTo add to this, the zoo was unable to apply to the government’s Zoo Animals Fund, the £100m fund created to help zoos struggling financially during the pandemic.\nThis has been the case for all Britain’s not-for-profit conservation zoos, many of which have been forced to lay off staff, apply for expensive commercial loans and rely on public donations to survive.\nAlex said:\n“It was fantastic to be at Whipsnade today, after it being shut for the last three months. I had a great time meeting all of the animals and the wonderful staff who care for them. Unfortunately, the government have not provided adequate support for our zoos. The Zoo Animals Fund is completely inaccessible for the majority of zoos and the job retention scheme does not take into consideration the need for animal care, and the fact that animals cannot be furloughed.\nThat said, It’s a testament to the fantastic care provided by staff that the animals are thriving: I’m quite envious of them living in blissful ignorance of the global pandemic!”.\nThe Zoo, set over 600 acres of countryside, is operating at a reduced capacity and with extensive safety measures in place to protect visitors. As well as a contactless ticketing system and clear social distancing guidelines, the zoo has hand sanitizer and handwash stations at regular stops around the site.\nFind out more about Whipsnade Zoo here: https://www.zsl.org/zsl-whipsnade-zoo",

As always stay safe and stay home.\nFurlough\nThe Government Furlough scheme (link) is there for anyone who now cannot continue in their job due to the Coronavirus crisis. The Government will provide 80% of the salaries capped at £2500 for the duration of the scheme. This is available to everyone who is paid via PAYE.\nThere has been some confusion as to whether or not this covers those on zero hours contracts. It is technical, but it is still possible for zero hours contract workers to be furloughed and it will generally be dictated by money earned in February.\nThere is a recurring issue with those who have only joined their job recently and have only been put on the payroll in March. They are not eligible currently to go on the scheme with their new employer. Whilst it is still possible for you to be furloughed by your February employer (and I would encourage those with good relationships with former employers to get in touch with them and ask to be put on furlough), many do not feel like they can do that for a number of reasons. It is therefore imperative that the Government bring the eligibility date forward, allowing those employed in March to be furloughed via their new employer. There is a petition for this here. Please do get in touch if you fall in this gap and need assistance at alex@alexsobel.co.uk\nCare Homes\nMy office has today been in touch with care homes across the constituency. None of them have been offered testing for staff and staff are sent home only if displaying symptoms or have been in contact with a known carrier of the virus. Many reported a lack of personal protection equipment (PPE).\nThose working in our care homes are dealing with a larger workload (as GP face to face visits reduce) and are struggling with staff shortages (as staff self-isolate). They desperately need testing and the right equipment to prevent the worst from happening in their facilities. I have today written to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to implore him to urgent supply the testing and equipment our care home staff desperately need. See my letter here\nFoodbanks\nOtley Foodbank have asked me to supply you with their account details so that you can donate to them directly. They are:\nOtley Foodbank Barclays Bank Sort code: 20 37 13 A/c No: 93368734\nLeeds North and West foodbank are still asking for donations. Please give generously here: https://leedsnorthandwest.foodbank.org.uk/give-help/donate-money/\nThank you for taking the time to read my updates. There will be more tomorrow.

Alex met with 3 or the 4 founding members, Bob Miles, Stuart Gregory and Dave Scannell. During the visit Alex learnt about their current and past Projects since their formation 5 years ago, when it was first registered with the Men’s Shed Association.\nAlex said, \"It was impressive to see the Men’s Shed's dedication to upcycling and recycling materials, as well as their outreach efforts to local schools and community groups.”\nIn the last five years Wharfedale Men’s Shed have been working with Wildlife Friendly Otley, making bird boxes, bird tables and Hedgehog pods. They have also made a Santa Sleigh for Ilkley Round Table, they have made and installed Swift Boxes at Westgate Primary School to name just a few of their projects.\nAs an advocate for community-driven initiatives and mental health awareness, Alex explained that “It was great to witness first-hand the incredible work being done at Wharfedale Men's Shed.” The visit provided an opportunity to meet with members and volunteers who contribute their time and skills to the well-being of our community.\n\"It was inspiring to witness the passion and dedication of the individuals at Wharfedale Men's Shed,\" remarked Alex. \"Their commitment to supporting one another and fostering a sense of belonging is a testament to the power of community.\"\nAlex engaged in conversations with members about the importance of mental health awareness, particularly among men who may often feel reluctant to seek help. \"The Men's Shed movement plays a vital role in promoting mental well-being by providing a supportive environment where individuals can connect with others and engage in meaningful activities,\" Alex emphasised.\nDuring the visit, Alex learnt of the desired plans of the Wharfedale Men’s Shed. Since their formation, whilst they are grateful to rent the Otley MakerSpace workshop in Otley Courthouse, they have been looking for better accommodation, due to space restrictions, which affects the well-being support and skill sharing opportunities they can offer.\nThey have identified a potential site at owned by Leeds Parks (formerly part of Grove Hill Park) and hope that by May of this year they can apply for the relevant regulatory approvals required and begin to seek funding for the proposed construction.\nThe new building would provide two spaces, a large workshop for woodworking and metalworking and a smaller ‘clean workshop/soft craft area’ that could be used by other local groups.\nSuch a workshop would mean the Men’s Shed would be able to facilitate more projects that they have previously had to turn down, due to working area and storage restrictions. The new workshops would also be able to see the formation of a Women’s Shed, which has been requested on several occasions.\nAlex was shown the proposed new site area and a sketch of the proposed new building. “The building would be of great benefit to the Men’s Shed as well as other local community groups and projects. I wish them every success in being able to go ahead with their proposal and will offer whatever assistance I can.”\nAlex said, \"I fully support the efforts of Wharfedale Men's Shed and similar initiatives across our constituency, and I am committed to amplifying their voices and championing their cause.\"",

It is the responsibility of integrated care boards (ICBs) to make appropriate provision to meet the health and care needs of their local population, including ADHD care pathways, in line with relevant National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. We are supporting a taskforce that NHS England is establishing to look at ADHD service provision and its impact on patient experience. The taskforce will bring together expertise from across a broad range of sectors, including the National Health Service, education, and justice, to better understand the challenges affecting people with ADHD and help provide a joined-up approach in response to concerns around rising demand. The West Yorkshire ICB advises that the Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (LYPFT) is taking steps to assess and respond to the impact of the suspension of non-urgent referrals. This includes working to redesign the adult ADHD pathway in Leeds and setting up a new care navigator service for people on the waiting list who would like to discuss what support they need and their options under the NHS Choice Framework. The ICB will be working with the ADHD patient support groups for Leeds and West Yorkshire on what they can do collectively to support patients during the pause to referrals, as well as involving them in the redesign of the local service.

Integrated care boards (ICBs) are responsible for providing services that meet the needs of their local population, including menopause services. ICBs are also expected to have a dedicated focus on tackling health inequalities. A recent rise in prescriptions for Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a promising sign that more women are getting the advice and help they need. The HRT Prescription Pre Payment-Certificate continues to provide significant savings for patients who are prescribed applicable HRT medications. The Department has invested £25 million over 2023/24 and 2024/25 to support the establishment of at least one pilot women’s health hub in every integrated care system. One of the aims of women’s health hubs is to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequalities. Menopause care is a core service for pilot women’s health hubs.",

Worryingly Scientists have said that the ‘R’ number (reproductive number of the virus) has increased this week. Last week it was estimated to be between 0.5 and 0.9, the figure is now believed to be around 0.7 to 1. Any number above 1 shows the outbreak is growing whilst the lower the number below 1 shows how much it is shrinking.\nReopening of Schools\nI am disgusted by the way teachers— many of whom have been already putting themselves at risk with no PPE teaching the children of key workers— are being villainised in the right wing press. Looking at the situation in care homes, would you trust this Government to keep you safe?\nReturning to school when it is safe to do so is a priority for the sake of pupils’ education and well-being. But there are serious problems with the proposed plan to reopen schools on 1 June, which parents and school leaders have raised.\nI am urging the Government to work with trade unions to create clear conditions, based on the tests they have set out, this will make sure that every school can put in place safety measures to ensure a safe return.\nFor the safety of all staff and pupils schools should only reopen when they meet those conditions.\nDiscretionary Business Support Scheme\nI am pleased that the Leader of Leeds City Council has made the following statement regarding the Government’s discretionary business support scheme.\n“We have just received the government guidance for the discretionary business support scheme and will be working through this to quickly establish and launch the process and eligibility criteria for businesses to apply as soon as possible. We will keep businesses updated via our communication channels as soon as we have the process live.”\n“The scheme is not as straightforward as the previous business support scheme, and therefore we have been undertaking local analysis and working with colleagues across West Yorkshire to help us prepare ahead of receiving this latest guidance so as to allow us to implement a scheme as quickly and efficiently as possible.”\nCouncil Funding\nIt is devastating to learn that Leeds City Council is facing a massive £121 million funding gap, as it struggles to deal with rising costs during the coronavirus lockdown.\nCllr Judith Blake, leader of the council, is calling on Boris Johnson’s government to provide more funding to support councils. Before the pandemic, Leeds City Council was in a difficult position, it already needed to find £28.4 million of savings and increase council tax, due to huge cuts to government funding and rising costs.\nDuring lockdown, the council has endured costs for services such as household waste collections, but has also lost millions of pounds.\nLeeds City Council has had to suspend business rates payments, cut council tax and close car parks and leisure centres.\nWhilst the impact of coronavirus on Leeds City Council’s finances is a £121 million funding gap, the government has only promised to provide £3.8 billion to help councils across the country deal with the impact, but that investment is not nearly enough.\n‘Ask Alex’\nJoin me tomorrow on Facebook Live at 2pm, where I will be discussing the latest information on Covid-19, including the easing of the lockdown rules and answering any related questions you may have.\nFollow my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/AlexSobelForLeedsNorthWest/ to participate in my Facebook Live sessions and to keep up to date with my activities both at home and in Parliament.",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_mp-petitions-first-over-axing-of-headingley-x84-stops/content_489.html": "MP petitions First over “axing” of Headingley X84 stops\n- Alex Sobel\n- Jun 6, 2020\n- 2 min read\nAlex Sobel has contacted First Bus as passengers of the X84 and X85 express their ‘deep concern’ over changes that see buses skip stops at Headingley and Hyde Park.\nThe MP for Leeds North West has received numerous correspondence over the past few days and a change.org petition has received over 300 signatures demanding a reverse to the changes.\nLauren Whyte who started the petition wrote on the site “Because of the problems with my eyes I will never drive. My mum and brother live in Otley and this cuts my off from them as I live in Headingley. I moved where I am to be on a direct bus link to them. Can I ask that everyone complain to first bus....this is a bonkers move on their part.\nThere are people who work at the Universities in both Headingley and Hyde Park who live in Otley who can now not get to work directly on public transport. Wheatfield’s Hospice is also on the Route, there is also a connecting bus to Chapel Allerton Hospital in Headingley for those that live in Otley. The bus takes the same route but just won’t stop. First bus does not make it easier for those of us with disabilities or without access to a car.”\nAlex Sobel said “Many constituents have contacted me to express their deep concern at the changes especially axing the stop at Headingley Arndale and the dramatic affect it will have on their day to day lives. As the lockdown rules are relaxed and people are returning to our roads in even greater number, safe bus use is essential.\nWe need to see an increase of bus services on our routes to encourage social distancing and to avoid chaos on our roads. Whilst there are risks to using public transport, there is an even greater risk in packed services and in asking people to change buses unnecessarily. It is far better to have our existing services making stops in our key areas on more frequent services.”",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_my-response-to-the-otley-east-consultation/content_305.html": "My response to the Otley East consultation\n- Alex Sobel\n- Jan 25, 2021\n- 3 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nI have received a great many responses to the survey I put out last week and this has been a huge help in putting together my response to the consultation. It is important to note that as an MP, I have no statutory power over planning decisions but it is important that I reflect the concerns of the community, fight for our shared priorities and provide you with good and accurate information.\nThe land to the East of Otley was designated for development under the UDP in 2006, long before the current council administration was in place. There are several reasons that it has taken so long to see a planning application come forward. Land-owner negotiations can take some time and there was little agreement as to the provision of a relief road. These issues now being resolved, an outline plan has been put forward to the public by the Otley East consortium and its principal developer Persimmon Homes.\nIt is important to note that this consultation is ahead of any planning application and is not the statutory consultation process that the council are required to provide once the application has gone in.\nThis means that although there is no legal way for anyone, including Leeds City Council, to prevent development altogether, there are several avenues available to us to challenge the plans.\nLast year, Otley’s Neighbourhood Plan won a huge mandate from residents, with almost 90% approval from the votes cast in the referendum, and is now statutory planning guidance. It provides a detailed set of guiding principles for the East of Otley site, that the developers must meet, including a comprehensive and detailed masterplan.\nI believe that the plans put forward this week lack the detail, imagination and consideration necessary for the comprehensive masterplan that is required for a development of this size and significance.\nThe loss of green spaces is of great concern to people locally. These are areas where people walk their dogs, play games, have picnics or enjoy the diverse local wildlife. The plan as it exists does little to address these concerns, nor does it give any indication as to where play spaces might be. The plan must show clear biodiversity net gain and address any issues with drainage which could exacerbate existing flooding problems in the Wharfe.\nThere is a housing need in Otley. People contact my office at an alarming frequency, frustrated by the struggle to find adequate housing in the town, particularly social or rented family homes. Whilst the plan does mention “a percentage of affordable housing” it does not make good on the council’s requirement for 35% affordable housing. I am also concerned with some of the ‘example street scenes’ which show a large number of detached properties with several bedrooms. 35% should be a ceiling not a floor and any development of this size must not play lip service, but solve Otley’s housing crisis.\nThere has been a lot of concern regarding local infrastructure. What will the impact be on our local GP surgeries, secondary school places, roads and amenities? I would have hoped the outline masterplan would have addressed this and I have in my submission recommended that amenities are available within the new development, to reduce unnecessary car journeys into town and the pressure on services. Whilst I am satisfied that the relief road will go a long way in reducing congestion, we still do not understand the full impact on traffic. We need the developer to undertake a detailed traffic survey and modelling exercise.\nThe plan’s ‘example street scenes’ are not really linked to the character of existing Otley housing: stone housing examples are bland, red tiled roofs are inappropriate, and there are no examples to reflect or echo the white rendered finish of houses on Cambridge estate / Peterhouse Drive. Otley is an historic beautiful market town. Additional housing must be in keeping with those traditions and must look like Otley from the ground and from the top of the Chevin.\nIt is not just the style of the housing that is important. A development of this size must have the ambition to be an example for 21st century housing. Super insulation, heat pump technology and energy efficiency must run through the core of the plan. As must the upskilling of the workforce to ensure that houses are built to the highest standard.\nWith all the above questions left unanswered, the developers have clearly not met thee guiding principles in the Neighbourhood Plan. I urge you to take part in this and all future consultations on the development and make your voice heard on the issues that matter most to you. This is a significant challenge, but I believe that together we can make a big difference",

I have spent the last few weeks planning and talking about it as well as hearing from constituents who are joining me.\nFresh fruit and veg at the People’s Supermarket\nThe first tricky thing was breakfast. I was at home and we usually have cereal. The problem is that all milk seems to come in plastic. Luckily, in Leeds milk is available in glass bottles by delivery. Today though we made do with toast.\nI spent much of my morning in the constituency office, where we don’t have much in the way of kitchen facilities so I thought I’d grab a sandwich locally. I was in a hurry so went into Subway. I could get a sandwich and cookie wrapped in paper, no drink though as they all came with a plastic top. I did notice how much plastic was used in Subway. The staff use plastic gloves which is great for hygiene but that must result in a lot of plastic being thrown away. These could easily be made from another material such as corn starch, so could the drink caps and the plastic straws.\nNext stop was to get some shopping in. R.K Harris on North Lane is a fantastic greengrocer. Not only\nR.K Harris in Headingley serve great produce in a paper bag.\ndo they supply fresh produce, they also sell it in a paper bag. Across the road is the natural food store. Result – I got a really nice loaf of bread in a paper bag as well as some chocolate eggs in foil for the kids. I couldn’t buy much in the ambient chiller though as everything was wrapped in plastic.\nWeirdly, the toughest part of my day was at the train station. I was desperate for a packet of crisps (my weakness), they all seem to come in plastic. I would be very grateful to anyone who got in touch to tell me how I could get crisps with no plastic!\nThe peoples Supermarket in London is a fantastic social enterprise and great for going plastic free.\nIn London, I stopped off at The Peoples Supermarket, a social enterprise that promotes fresh local produce and sustainable living. I bought some ingredients for dinner, went home and made a Catalan style Pan Con Tomate. Yum!\nI’d love to hear your stories, please post on my Facebook page or write to me at alex@alexsobel.co.uk.",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_dominic-cummings-your-stories/content_460.html": "Dominic Cummings: Your stories\n- Alex Sobel\n- May 26, 2020\n- 5 min read\nUpdated: Jul 26, 2023\nI have received over the past few days, hundreds of emails concerning the Dominic Cummings saga. Below are just a few of the quotes that have really stood out to me and that I think are important to share more widely. For obvious reasons of privacy, names have been redacted.\nConstituent 1\nLast year my siblings and I had to make an incredibly difficult decision to put our 79 year old mother into a care home that specialised in caring for residents with advanced dementia. Whilst mum really wasn’t mum, at least she recognised us when we went to visit her, and she always seemed happy to see us. Since lockdown we have clearly not been able to visit her, but the staff have been great and have often used their own phones to FaceTime mum for us. Still, it’s not the same as being close to her and many was the time that I so wanted to take the 50 mile journey to see her, but the instructions were clear, Stay Home! My mum has now stopped asking for us and we believe our worst fear is upon us, she will no longer recognise us!! Truly a devastating and horrid thing to happen to me and my siblings!\nStill, we never felt compelled to breach or adapt the simple instruction, stay home, during this pandemic. In fact we will continue to comply with the advice offered because we do not have the levels of sheer contempt for our neighbours and the general population exhibited over these past few days by Mr Cummings and his vanguard.\nConstituent 2\nMy family and I, like lots of other families, have lived through difficulties and tragedies in this time.When my entire house were very sick with Corona symptoms, even when one flatmate and I were having difficulties breathing and staying awake, our family managed to not drive the 250 miles to see us. When my Grandma died in March there were only 5 people at her funeral, I was not allowed to attend. When my Father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and given 3 years to live I did not see him for over a month, I have still not gone near him.\nWhen my Grandad died in April, I had not seen him in the last few months of his life. His funeral was attended by 11 people, the only person I could go near was my brother. I cannot begin to express the negative effect this has had on myself and my family. But we did not act in the interest of our family, we stuck to the rules like the law abiding citizens we are.\nConstituent 3\nMy own mum has stage 4 cancer that has now spread – the spread has only just been picked up as she was unable to attend for screening and tests earlier due to lockdown and limited hospital visits. I still can’t see her in Cambridgeshire as to do so would not be an essential journey and no one in my family, including me, could justify the journey at this time.\nDominic Cummings’ actions are an insult to those who have stayed away from sick loved ones, and those who have mourned alone.\nConstituent 4\nOn 6th April, my younger brother phoned to tell me that my Dad had died. He passed away suddenly in his sleep aged just 65, at the home he shared in Cumbria with my brother and Mum. He’d been briefly ill with COVID19.\nSince then, I have been unable to hug my Mum, or my younger brother and sister. With the exception of his brief funeral, that I feel incredibly lucky to have been allowed to attend in person, I’ve been unable to see them at all. We have not been able to sit around our family dining table, which now has an empty seat, and share tears in our time of grief.\nTo see Boris Johnson et al support the actions of Cummings, feels like a personal insult to myself and every other family to be bereaved the past few months. It is gaslighting an entire nation, and implying their instincts are not as valid as those in the conservative party.\nFor the conservative party to allow his actions to go unreprimanded, whilst refusing to even discuss when families may be reunited, is heartbreaking.\nConstituent 5\nMy wife is in the high-risk category, so in order to continue to work on the front-line I stayed away from home in a hotel room from the start of the lockdown, isolated from my wife and 2 year old son. I went home after 14 days of my wife being symptom free followed by another 14 days of wearing Level 3 PPE to every incident. This was difficult for our family, but the right thing to do for their safety and for patients who need an ambulance, this seems to be the ‘common sense’ approach. A small sacrifice in comparison to those who have not been able to attend the birth of their child, or hold the hand of a dying relative because they were following the lockdown rules.\nConstituent 6\nSince lockdown I have been unable to see my only grandchild and/or help out with her childcare as I usually do. I have not seen either of my daughters or any of my friends except on Skype. I have lost two family members and been unable to offer comfort or condolence in person to my relatives or attend the funerals. In both cases the deceased died alone as their next of kin were not allowed to visit them in hospital, despite neither of them having Covid 19. My elderly mother, for whom I am a carer, was distraught at being unable to attend their funerals. In other words, I have obeyed the government’s lockdown rules despite the heartache it has caused because I can see the sense in them.\nConstituent 7\nI have a friend who shortly before lockdown received the news that the stage IV bowel cancer she has been living with has recurred.

She has been unable to start the only treatment that may extend this (chemotherapy) because of COVID-19 and has not been able to see her family or friends because of the lockdown. Spending the last weeks of your life in isolation is a much more extreme circumstance than that faced by Dominic Cummings but she hasn’t broken the rules because she puts others before herself.\nOr my brother and his wife who live in London and have a one year old little girl. They live in a very small flat with no outside space. They both had COVID-19 in March and didn’t break the rules even though they were worried about their little girl.

This is an extremely difficult and disruptive time and what is being asked of everybody is unprecedented. The most important message remains stay home and stay safe. This makes it even more important to look after your mental and physical health as much as possible. Exercise every day if you can and see this guidance on mental health from the Department of Health and Social Care.\nPolice powers\nMany people have asked me about enforcement and it took some time for West Yorkshire Police to get clarity on the situation and what was expected of them. They have outlined their approach to policing the lockdown. As I am sure everyone can understand, individual police officers will have to use their judgement on a case by case basis. They will follow these guidelines:\nEngage – We police by consent. Our initial police response will be to encourage voluntary compliance.\nExplain – We will stress that this is a national public health emergency. Explaining that they are putting their own and other people’s lives at risk, and that they are contributing to placing the NHS under more pressure.\nEncourage – We will ask them politely to comply with our requests, informing them of the potential consequences should they fail to do so.\nEnforce – We may use our powers under the new legislation. This includes the ability to issue fines, use reasonable force to remove someone to their home address, or to make an arrest.\nWith regard to enforcement, the police have a range of powers to enforce the social distancing policy of the government: instruct people to go home, leave an area or disperse; ensure parents are taking necessary steps to stop their children breaking these rules; issue a fixed penalty notice of £60, which will be lowered to £30 if paid within 14 days; issue a fixed penalty notice of £120 for second time offenders, doubling on each further repeat offence.\nProtecting the vulnerable\nThe Leeds City Council hotline number for those vulnerable people who do not feel that they have appropriate support around them to manage the crisis is 0113 378 1877. Please do share this number as far and wide as possible.\nThis week (w.c. 23rd March), many people with high risk conditions have been notified through a letter or text from the NHS, or through direct contact from their hospital consultant or their local GP practice.\nNationally, it is estimated that there are 1.5 people who fall into this category of very high clinical risk, and in Leeds this number is estimated to be 14,000-15,000 people.\nFor many, with the help of family, friends or neighbours and those with existing support and care arrangements in place, this difficult period will be managed without the need for additional support. For others without strong networks, or whose networks are significantly disrupted by the pandemic, they will be unable to shield themselves without systematic support around the priority areas of: food, medicines, financial support and social connection.\nPeople without robust arrangements are being asked in the first instance to register for assistance here: gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable or by phoning a national automated telephone service in order to register for support. Requests for support will then be relayed back to local government from the national database. Leeds of course has the number listed above which offers a direct local connection.\nHousing\nHousing Leeds has made a decision to suspend lettings to Council homes via our Choice Based Lettings system, with immediate effect. All advertised council homes as of 25th March have been withdrawn. Where an applicant has already been offered a Council home in a previous bidding cycle, this offer will be honoured, but there may be some delays in the home becoming available. If applicants have been offered a home, an officer will make contact with them in the next few days to discuss their individual circumstances and will be able to offer any further advice and support.\nFor more details on this see https://www.leedshomes.org.uk/\nIf someone is currently homeless or facing the prospect of homelessness they can continue to access Housing Options services by calling 0113 2224412\nVentillators and Testing\nIt is very disturbing that the Government seemed to have missed out on the EU ventilator scheme. I hope that this is a genuine mistake rather than an example of the Government putting optics about working with the EU above the lives of people in this country. Seee https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals Trust is using the laboratory in Leeds as a regional centre for testing. This is being used to capacity and inpatient testing remains the priority. LTHT is expecting support from Public Health England to increase the amount of testing that can be done and to begin testing of staff. I am continuing to press the Government to expand their testing as it has really not been good enough so far.\nAnd finally…\nWe still have much to learn about this virus and new aspects are developing over time. There have been reports that some otherwise asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus experience a loss of smell and taste. If you are experiencing this, I would strongly advise that you self isolate for 14 days.\nThank you all. I will update again tomorrow.",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_mp-urges-constituents-to-stay-well-this-winter-by-getting-free-flu-jab/content_183.html": "MP Urges Constituents to Stay Well this Winter by Getting Free Flu Jab\n- Alex Sobel\n- Nov 3, 2017\n- 3 min read\nLeeds North West MP Alex Sobel has urged those in Otley who are at risk of getting flu to get their free vaccine jab before winter sets in as it emerged that 122,142 people missed out on protection last year across Leeds’ local authority area. Flu vaccination rates continue to climb across the country, but remain lower than ideal in many areas.\nAlex Sobel’s call comes as the Chief Medical Officer warned last week that flu and complications associated with it cause 8,000 deaths on average a year in England - around 6,000 of which are people with existing heart and lung conditions. And official figures show that just under 2.9m bed days were lost to flu and pneumonia last year in English hospitals, up almost 280,000 from the previous year – an 11% increase.\nIn the Leeds area last year:\n33952 older people missed out on their jab, and among over-65s with long- term conditions which make them more vulnerable to the effects of flu, just 41.9% were vaccinated.\nA further 64264 working age people with long-term conditions also didn’t get the vaccine.\nThousands of young children (2-4 year olds) also didn’t get the vaccine, including 600 who were classed as being at greater risk.\n4601 pregnant women with no long-term conditions and 366 pregnant women with long-term conditions also didn’t get protected.\nAlex Sobel said: “Getting the flu can be bad enough for even the fittest of us, but for older people and those with long-term conditions in particular it can cause serious health problems.\n“Getting the flu jab is free and easy, and offers the best chance of avoiding the flu that we have. I’d therefore urge all those eligible – including all care home staff for the first time - to speak to your GP or local pharmacist and get your vaccination booked in before the cold weather sets in. It is really important we get this message out in Otley in Yeadon where we have a lot of eligible older residents who are particularly at risk.”\nThis year, more people than ever – around 21 million - will be offered the vaccination. Children in school year 4 will be offered the vaccine for the first time and children over age 4 in reception year can get their vaccine in school.\nA £10m programme will also see a free vaccination offered to all care home workers via their GP or pharmacist. Official figures show that older people are three times as likely to be admitted to hospital with flu if they live in a care home, with emergency flu and pneumonia admissions from care homes jumping by 16% last year alone to around 29,000.\nThe national drive marks the start of the Public Health England and NHS England’s joint Stay Well This Winter campaign, which helps the most vulnerable people prepare for winter and avoid having to visit hospital due to common winter illnesses.\nNHS England’s National Medical Director for Acute Care, Professor Keith Willett, said: “Hospitals and GPs are preparing intensively for this winter, and we would remind people of the importance of having a flu vaccination.\nThere are 21 million people eligible this year, but last year eight million people missed out and that is something we can all definitely change.”\nMore information on eligibility for the flu jab, and other tips on staying well this winter, can be found at www.nhs.uk/staywell",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_coronavirus-update-tuesday-31st-march-2020/content_514.html": "Coronavirus update Tuesday 31st March 2020\n- Alex Sobel\n- Mar 31, 2020\n- 3 min read\nThank you for reading today’s update. The death rate is sadly rising and cases continue to grow in the United Kingdom and across the globe. There is, however, room for optimism and there are early indications that the social distancing measures are working. The financial times has produced useful graphs which detail the picture in the UK and in other countries.\nExercise\nI have had contact with several constituents asking about exercise, some people feel like they cannot exercise from home due to living on a main road with little pavement or in a very built up urban area. The guidance is that you should not need to drive to exercise and the closure of the car parks are in reference to that. That said, I cannot see anything unreasonable about driving a short distance if you have to do so due to your individual circumstances. I think the point is to use common sense, adhere to the spirit of the rules rather than work to a technocratic solution. As I said yesterday, West Yorkshire Police is working much more on education and on being reasonable with the public rather than on being reactive and punitive. If we all take the guidance seriously and act appropriately we will have no need for enforcement. The government has, however, promoted the continued use of allotments thus far on the basis that these are not places that provide for mass gatherings (like parks) and are not usually located directly next to the owners residence.\nAppeal for emergency food provision: This is an appeal to meet the ever increasing demand whilst some many people are struggling during this crisis. Fareshare have now set up a focused campaign to allow individuals and companies to donate key items or money to enable further food purchases. Details of the campaign can be found here, with a direct email for anyone who wants to make offers of products or money leedsappeal@fareshareyorkshire.org\nPlease continue to give generously to Leeds North and West Foodbank who are raising money to be able to provide the best possible provision to our area at this difficult time. Please donate here\nCovid App\nI would like to promote an important project designed to help track the spread of coronavirus. You can download the King’s College London COVID app to report daily how you’re feeling, whether you’re unwell or currently fit. https://covid.joinzoe.com/ This will allow scientists to better understands the trends in particular locations and provide vital information to everyone charged with managing the crisis.\nGPs\nGP practices are taking measures to protect patients and their staff. This includes changes to the way appointments are booked, reducing face to face appointments and increasing telephone consultations. GP practices will contact patients if you have a pre-booked appointment to confirm arrangements.\nIf anyone thinks they may have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) please do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. You do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.

Alternatively you can call 111 if you need to speak to someone.\nSmall business rate relief\nProperties in Leeds who currently receive Small Business Rate Relief (all properties with a rateable value of up to £15,000) will be eligible for a £10,000 grant. Businesses do not need to apply for grants; if they are eligible the Council will contact them in early April when funding becomes available.

Biodiversity is the backbone of a healthy planet. It supports everything from clean air and water to food security and climate resilience. However, our natural world is facing unprecedented threats, and the need for ambitious, effective, and coordinated action has never been more pressing.\nAt home in the UK, we have a unique opportunity to ensure this is put into law through the Climate and Nature Bill (CANBill). This groundbreaking piece of legislation, which I am proud to have introduced to Parliament, would lock in the ambition to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030, setting legally binding targets to protect and restore our natural landscapes, habitats, and wildlife.\nPassing the CAN Bill would position the UK as a global leader in biodiversity conservation, showing our commitment not only to addressing climate change but also to preserving our ecosystems and biodiversity.\nThe CAN Bill could also drive positive change with, encouraging sustainable agriculture, responsible land use, and habitat restoration on a large scale. It’s a chance to build a greener, more resilient future where nature thrives alongside communities, where people have greater access to green spaces, and where we take collective responsibility for the planet’s health.\nCOP16 provides a unique platform for these discussions. By collaborating with MPs across party lines, we’re sending a message that biodiversity is not a partisan issue; it’s a universal imperative.\nThe knowledge and ideas shared at this conference will be instrumental in shaping how we approach nature conservation in the UK and beyond.\nLet’s keep pushing for the CAN Bill and ensure that the UK’s commitment to biodiversity goes beyond words. Together, we can halt nature loss and create a legacy of restoration and respect for future generations.",

Many constituents have been in touch with Mr Sobel to air their concerns.\nIn a letter to Heineken, Mr Sobel said, “I have received a great deal of correspondence from concerned local residents as well as the Otley Pub Club to tell me how worried they are about the character being lost from these listed buildings. Otley has a rich history of pubs and, as in many small towns, these establishments are important social hubs for the community.\nParts of The White Swan can be traced back over 250 years, with architecture in keeping with that of many of the other historic buildings in the town. The pub has been owned by only a few families since the early 1800s and is known to many as a fantastic place for a quiet pint by an open fire. It has also recently undergone a very tasteful and respectful makeover. I for one do not think it needs any more restoration.\nThe Black Bull is the oldest pub in Otley and is thought to date as far back as the 16th century. The pub has been home to many historic discoveries including a 18th century water pump, two 16th and 17th century fireplaces and an original door. The Black Bull is also famous for having allegedly been drunk dry by Oliver Cromwell’s Troops before the battle of Marston Moor.\nBoth buildings are grade II listed, and I think it is clear from the reaction to your proposals that the local community needs assurances that these two pieces of Otley’s proud History will be respected and protected.\nI would therefore request that you pause all plans for refurbishment and meet with me, Otley Pub Club and other members of the community to listen to concerns and include all parties in the decision-making process. I am happy to facilitate this meeting and bring all parties concerned together.”\nHeineken have agreed to meet with Mr Sobel as well as a scheduled meeting with Otley Pub Club. Mr Sobel has encouraged as many voices as possible to air their views “Otley’s pubs are a key part of the Otley’s identity. It is therefore vital that their character and history is respected. It is important that as many voices as possible are heard on this and that Heineken hear our concerns.”",

But, Alex Sobel has agreed a deal that would see a spectacular light display in its place.\nWorking with Yeadon Town Hall, the iconic building will be lit up with professional Christmas lights that would rival displays across the city.\nAs well as this, Mr Sobel is putting plans in place for a socket to be installed so that a full Christmas tree can be mounted in time for Christmas 2019.\nMr Sobel said\n“The Yeadon residents have worked so hard to build momentum for a Christmas display that is worthy of Yeadon High Street. I am so pleased that we have managed to secure the lights display for this year and have the structural engineering in place for a full Christmas Tree next year. Yeadon has some fantastic local businesses, many of whom have been very keen to get this project off the ground. It is amazing to think about what can be achieved when we all work together.”\nJulia Briggs of Apperley lane is one of the key campaigners on the issue. She said\n“It is great to be part of this and I thank Martin from Smart in Gardening for starting this off. It sometimes feels like Yeadon is the poor cousin to other areas such as Rawdon or Otley. A Christmas display feels like a small thing, but it would be a fantastic morale boost for our high street and our community.\nOver recent years, the Christmas light switch on has felt more like a damp squib so we could really use something to lift our spirits. I am amazed by the positive response we have received from local businesses, and from the new owners of the Town Hall and am delighted that our local MP has done so much to help us.”\nDavid Smith at Rosie Pound said\n“The support is in the community for this, given the current decline in our high streets something as simple as this could help make a difference in bringing the whole community together.”",

The MP for Leeds North West made his point during discussions around making tower blocks safer for residents following the devastation of Grenfell Tower saying that “..the only solution is to ban combustible cladding?”\nFollowing the debate the Government agreed to consult on banning the cladding labelled a “silent killer” since the events of Grenfell Tower took place almost one year ago. Mr Sobel has been joined by his Labour Party colleagues in calling for an immediate ban.\nThe cladding has been found to be a major contributing factor to the fire that spread throughout the tower block, claiming the lives of at least 71 people. Alex Sobel echoes the calls of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Local Government Association who have voiced their concerns over the legality of combustible materials on tower blocks.\nFollowing the events in June last year, local authorities found that thousands of tower blocks across the UK faced similar risks of insecurity due to combustible cladding and a lack of sprinkler systems. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry debate gave MPs the chance to raise any concerns or considerations for the victims of Grenfell Tower or from their own constituency. These recommendations will be considered by the Government to guide legislation that will protect residents of tower blocks.\nMr Sobel’s call for a complete ban was met with agreement from conservative MP Giles Watling, who said: “I absolutely agree that we must ban combustible cladding. It should never have been used in the first place”.\nThe debate began with a reading of the names of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and a 72 second silence to remember those whose lives were lost.",

Of particular concern to me was the notion of new road access from existing residential streets. I felt that it was important to seek clarification from Persimmon directly on the claims made so that we can have full transparency and clarity on the issue.”\nIn their response to Mr Sobel, Persimmon said: “Persimmon has made no request to the Site Allocations Plan inspector regarding an increase in the allocation of housing adopted by the Unitary Development Plan (UDP).\nWe can confirm we are seeking to amend the UDP allocation boundary along the anticipated alignment of the relief road. This alteration is based on sound technical and highway safety rationale and not with the desire to increase house numbers.\nThere are also no proposals to provide vehicular access from existing adjacent residential streets.”\nAlex Sobel added: “ There are clear discrepancies between the letter sent out by the ward councillors and the response I received from Persimmon. I have arranged to meet Paul Thornton, Persimmon West Yorkshire Planning Manager, to get full and accurate details about their development plan, including delivery of the relief road, so I can give residents clear and factual information direct from the source. As elected representatives, we have a responsibility to seek full clarification on the important issues before we make assertions to the public.”\n“The East of Otley site was allocated for development in 2006 when a Lib Dem/Tory Coalition ran Leeds City Council. Unfortunately there are no mechanisms to stop the development from happening altogether. So, we need to scrutinise the developers properly, supply residents with accurate information, not rumours, and work together to ensure that any development that goes ahead delivers maximum benefits for the town, without playing politics.”",

This is not an easy time for any of us. I hear from families unable to hold proper funerals for loved ones, I hear from parents who have very little space at home (sometimes themselves with symptoms), desperately trying to look after their children. I hear from shielded individuals who have not set foot out of their home since this crisis began who are feeling increasingly isolated and distressed.\nThey are all making sacrifices and are doing so because their government have rightly stressed the need for these sacrifices to be made in order to save lives. What people need from their government is clarity, consistency and a sense that those sacrifices are being respected by everyone, no matter how high in stature.\nWhat Dominic Cummings did was wrong. It was every bit as wrong as Neil Ferguson, who did the right thing in the end and resigned for breaking lockdown advice last month.\nI am also a father. I understand the urge to reach out to members of my family for support during a very challenging time. But, out of respect for the safety of those family members, the need for nationwide discipline to save lives and in light of the sacrifices that I am asking my constituents to make every day I have not succumbed to this instinct.\nThe selfish actions of this individual at the heart of government involved in making the decision on the lockdown is one thing, the Prime Minister’s statement on Sunday evening was quite another. Boris Johnson had an opportunity to show the country that this kind of hypocrisy is not tolerated by the UK Government. Instead, he chose not only to defend but condone the actions of his advisor. In doing so he undermined the lockdown, put lives at risk and completely disrespected everyone who has been trying, through adversity, to do the right thing in this crisis. Boris Johnson has undermined the country’s ability to come out of the crisis sooner by trashing his own credibility and the credibility of the official advice.\nI want the government to succeed, to get this right for the sake of every vulnerable UK citizen and to avoid a second peak and another damaging lockdown. By protecting Dominic Cummings, I fear, not for the first time, that they have created a bigger hill for us all to climb.",

The former electrician won Leeds North West in the 1997 landslide, beating sitting MP Keith Hampson to become the first Labour MP for the constituency. Harold was a popular local MP one of his many achievements for the people of North West Leeds, was to save the Wharfedale Hospital in Otley.\nThe former electrician won Leeds North West in the 1997 landslide, beating sitting MP Keith Hampson to become the first Labour MP for the constituency.\nAlex Sobel the current Labour MP for Leeds North West said, “My first ever tour of Parliament was with Harold and I wasn’t even a constituent, his example is something I now follow as the MP and my first ever canvassing session was with Harold on the Meanwood Valley Estate where he spoke to me about the difference a Labour Council could make. I now try to inspire young activists in the way Harold inspired me.\nHarold had Leeds North West flowing through his veins and did so much to bring government funding to our area and rebuilding the Wharfedale Hospital. As his successors we have a very high bar to meet.”\nJudith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council and former Leeds North West Parliamentary candidate said “My thoughts go out to Glyn and all of his family at this difficult time. So many Labour Party members across Leeds will remember Harold with great respect and affection. His famous victory in the election of 1997 changed the political map forever.\nHarold served his constituents with great passion and conviction and his loss will be felt deeply by those who knew him.”\nFormer Labour Councillor John Eveleigh said “Harold was one of the most principled people that I knew. I got to know him very well and can say categorically that Otley would not have a Hospital today were it not for the lead that Harold took back in the late nineties.\nHe was a great humanitarian - and was one of the brave Labour MPs who voted and campaigned against the war in Iraq. I well remember the euphoria that we all felt when he became the first Labour MP for Leeds North West - and I was always taken by the way he connected with people.”\nAnne Cherry, Chair of Leeds North West Labour Party said, “those of us who were privileged to work with Harold will remember him as a passionate supporter of the community he both lived in and represented, and a staunch defender of the best in traditional Socialism. He will be sadly missed by the many people he helped and encouraged over the years.”\nDudley Parker, Otley resident and Yorkshire blue badge tour guide said “It is with a deep sense of personal sadness that I have just learnt of the death of Harold Best MP. last evening. He counted as a personal friend and professional colleague within the Leeds Education Service He spoke at my father’s funeral. He embodied the Left-Wing Tradition of The Labour Party which he combined with an unbreakable loyalty to the cause of electing a Labour Government.\nI was honoured to work with him on the campaigns and to represent him on Community Groups in the Constituency I spent time in Westminster assisting him in his duties as an MP. He epitomised the meaning of Comrade . He was the first serving Labour MP to be elected for the Constituency of Leeds North West. I salute him.”",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_mp-addresses-paycap-rally/content_75.html": "MP Addresses Paycap Rally\n- Alex Sobel\n- Oct 3, 2017\n- 2 min read\nOtley’s MP, Alex Sobel, joined five other speakers at the Leeds Paycap Rally Outside of Leeds Art Gallery on October 3rd. As the only MP to address the rally he called on the government to ‘give Britain a payrise.’ The Paycap or pay freeze was installed under the Tory/Lib Dem government of 2010. It has meant that over the seven years the average health worker, for example, has suffered a real terms pay cut of nearly £2000 - with midwives losing over £3500 and ambulance staff well over £5000.\nIt’s estimated that the cap and freeze have meant that police officers have had a real terms reduction in pay of 14.6% since 2010. The cap has only just been lifted by the government.\nBut the new offers are still below inflation – and don’t make up for a seven-year squeeze.\nAlex said: “The pay freeze came alongside the slowest growth in the economy for generations and resulted in a pay squeeze that hurt the families of nurses, police officers, social workers, fire fighters, teachers and prison officers. As politicians, we ask people to work on the front line caring for our elderly relatives, educating our children and keeping our communities safe.\nThey deserve nothing less than to be paid properly. “After seven years the Tories have finally lifted the paycap but like most things with this government, this weak government, it is less than a half measure. Firefighters, have only been offered a 2% increase which, in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster is frankly an insult to those who risk their lives every single day.\nTeachers have been offered a measly 1%. With ever increasing workloads and pressures, this is not going to be enough to stop the floods of good qualified professionals leaving the profession in their droves.”\n\"Many of the staff that keep Leeds public sector services going travel in from their homes in outlying areas such as Otley and Yeadon. Not only are they facing real term pay cut but also rising costs in transport to get to work, increasing traffic congestion and air- pollution due to this government failure to tackle transport infrastructure in the north.”\n“Make no mistake, these pay cuts (and let’s call them pay cuts) were not done in the national interest. They were an ideological assault on the many for the benefit of the few. It’s time Britain had a payrise.”",

The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. However, it will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills.\nUnder the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023:\n• those with assets of less than £20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income\n• those with more than £100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council\n• those with assets between £20,000 and £100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay £86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap.\nAlex Sobel, MP for Leeds North West, who voted against the Bill said, “in the 2019 General Election, the Prime Minister Promised that no one will have to sell their home to pay for social care. In 2021, announces plans that will force working families to sell their home to pay for care. This Government has a track record for breaking election promises, but this is perhaps the worst yet.\nHe continues, “under these plans, if your house is worth £100k you are left with just £20K after social care costs are covered. On the other hand, if your house is worth £500k, you are left with £414k. In other words, if you are poor, you lose 8O percent of your assets, rich, you lose just 20 percent.This isn’t levelling up, it is an attack on those most in need.\nHe concluded, “Just as Labour led the world in creating a National Health Service in the 20th century, we will lead again to build a national care service in the 21st.”",

This will be vital in preparing Otley for its carbon neutral future and will encourage cleaner vehicles in our area.\nI have campaigned for this extensively, having raised it countless times in the House of Commons and have had several meetings with the combined authority and Leeds City Council to try to make this happen. This news comes on the back of Leeds City Council declaring a ‘climate emergency’ and I am pleased that words have been met with action so quickly. It is a wonderful success, but it is only a start. We have a long journey ahead of us in the fight against climate change and air pollution. I will continue to fight for the health of my constituents and for the future of our planet.”",

People convicted of such an offence will be liable to a fine or be issued with a fixed penalty notice.\nPart 2 of the Bill prohibits the export of “relevant livestock” from Great Britain, subject to a penalty of imprisonment, a fine or both (applies in England, Scotland and Wales although the maximum duration of imprisonment may vary). Relevant livestock is described in the Bill as bulls, cows, heifers, calves, buffalo, bison, horses, ponies, donkeys, asses, hinnies, mules, zebras, sheep, goats, pigs and wild boar.\nPart 3 also introduces powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations about the importation of dogs, cats and ferrets into Great Britain on the grounds of animal welfare. This includes the possibility to do so for animals below a prescribed age, those who have been mutilated (e.g., dogs with cropped ears), or those which are heavily pregnant.\nI look forward to scrutinising it to ensure that it goes far enough in its proposals.\nIn Feb this year I joined the Puppy Smuggling Taskforce and support Dogs Trust in their efforts to raise awareness of and tackle the abhorrent puppy smuggling trade.\nI have spoken extensively before on animal welfare in Parliament, including putting this question to the department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on having animal welfare inspectors.\nand again I have written to this department to hold the Government to account on the number of animals transported to mainland Europe for slaughter.\nThe Labour Party is an adamant supporter of animal rights in the UK, with Labour securing the Animal Welfare Act for domestic animals.\nThe last Labour manifesto set out a vision “where no animal is made to suffer unnecessary pain and degradation and where we continue to drive up standards and practice in line with the most recent advances and understanding.”\nAs well as supporting a high welfare future for farming and a ban on the use of cages by 2025.\nThe Labour Animal Welfare manifesto also states:\n‘Labour will ban people from keeping pet primates as part of our plans to bring Britain’s animal welfare laws into the 21st century.’ ‘Labour said an estimated 5,000 primates are being kept as pets in the UK, but they are highly intelligent animals and not suitable to be kept in captivity.’\nDuring my time as an MP, I have questioned Government ministers several times on Animal Welfare, these can be seen at:\nAs I am now a Shadow Minister (Tourism & Heritage) I am no longer permitted to sign Early Day Motions, but previous to my time in the Shadow Cabinet I signed numerous relating to Animal Welfare, see a selection below:\nAs your MP, I will continue to do all I can to stand up for animal rights.\nAll details are correct at date of publication",

This struck a chord with the local MP who, as a member of the Co-operative Party, believes strongly in this ethos.\nModelsport maintains an ‘excellent’ 5-star rating on Trust Pilot, with many customers flocking to the website to praise their customer service, prices and swift delivery.\nMr Sobel said “it was a great pleasure to meet Kris, a member of the sales team, and hear about his history in Otley and their plans for the future. It is important that small businesses like Modelsport, who are making waves in their industry are highlighted. It is also great to see Otley’s entrepreneurial culture alive and well.”\nKristian Armitage said: “We were pleased to receive a visit from our local MP and are grateful for his support.

That Unison members, many of whom are employed by councils work very hard and do the best that they can with the resources they have. That you cannot expect to cut councils to the bone and still expect the same quality of public services.\nIn the Constituency that Alex represents, which is her home area, 88% of council workers say that budget cuts, in the past two years, have had an impact on their ability to do their job the best that they can.\nMr Sobel agreed, he said.\n“ It was a pleasure to meet Karen and to read the findings of Unison’s survey. It does not make for pleasant reading and the results are unsurprising. The deep cuts that have been inflicted on local councils in the last eight years are biting and it is causing real challenges for those council workers who are tasked with providing the services in which we all depend. The Government simply must hear their calls and provide council workers with the resources they need to do their jobs.”",

The most obvious barrier that we see is one of cost and it is important that we foster a market where second hand EVs are normal and that prices are competitive with where petrol and diesel vehicles are now. Less obvious but no less important is the following question: How do we ensure wide access to charging infrastructure whether you live in a terrace in Otley, a large multi-occupancy building in town, a semi-rural village or in a council house in the outer areas?\nThere are really two parts to this answer, and it is important to remember that solutions are being hypothesised and tested as well as being considered by policy makers. The first part is that we look at widely available public charging infrastructure. Leeds is a leader in this regard. As well as being a local authority with the largest number of full electric vehicles (43), it is rapidly increasing its EV charge point infrastructure with having 74 being installed on the corporate estate, with 30 of those being fitted in the last financial year alone and in Otley we have seen the installation of a point at Licks carpark which I hope to be the first of many within the town. I have been lobbying local supermarkets to install rapid charging infrastructure as well as at Leeds Bradford Airport. We know that alongside cost, charging anxiety is the biggest barrier to the purchase of ultra-low emission vehicles and it is important that we see publicly available charge points appear visibly across our city. It is also worth noting the ULEV parking permit scheme that has been introduced in the city centre to add extra incentive for the purchase of electric vehicles.\nThe second part is, as you say, how do we provide the greatest possible access for home charging infrastructure. This is a lot more complex. For those with driveways it is a lot easier to fit the necessary equipment and there are grants available from the council to do so now. For those who have on street parking, we could look to Hackney Council, who are currently installing charge points within lampposts and have an ambition to roll this out across all residential streets in the borough. This technology is still within its infancy and it is likely that to roll something like that out everywhere, there would need to be some significant modifications made to the cabling.\nIn short, there are no set-in stone solutions in place yet, but I have confidence that with continued investment, public interest and political will, we will see the proliferation of charging infrastructure that will trigger the age of ultra-low emission vehicles.",

Whilst these are individual cases not outbreaks, advice has been provided and the appropriate steps taken, and I have been reassured that the situation is under control in each school.\nSchools have been provided with updated guidance about what to do when a pupil tests positive for coronavirus. Five care homes are currently affected, including one being supported with an outbreak.\nThe Budget- announcements\nVAT\nThe Chancellor announced cuts to VAT on food, accommodation and attractions from 20% to 5% from next Wednesday. The VAT cut will apply to eat-in or hot takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as accommodation in hotels. The Treasury said it hoped firms would pass the VAT savings on to customers but many had been without income for months so it would be their decision. The cut will last until spring next year.\nEnd of Furlough\nFurlough will end in October. The government will pay firms a £1,000 bonus for every staff member kept on for three months when the furlough scheme ends.\nSunak rejected calls to extend the furlough scheme beyond October. He said it would give people “false hope” that they will have a job to return to and that “the longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade”. The “job retention bonus” could cost as much as £9.4bn if every furloughed worker is brought back.\nThe chancellor said: “If you’re an employer and you bring back someone who you furloughed we’ll pay you a £1,000 bonus per employee. For businesses to get the bonus, the employee must be paid at least £520 on average, in each month from November to the end of January.” This is the equal of the lower earnings limit in National Insurance.\nThe chancellor also announced the “kickstart scheme” to create more jobs for young people. The fund will subsidise six-month work placements for people on Universal Credit aged between 16 and 24.\nDining out\nMr Sunak announced a scheme to give 50% off to people dining out in August. Mr Sunak also announced an “Eat Out to Help Out” discount. Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50% off in August, up to a maximum discount of £10 per head.\nStamp Duty\nA temporary stamp duty holiday, costing £3.8bn, to stimulate the property market was another measure unveiled by the chancellor. This will exempt the first £500,000 of all property sales from the tax.\nMiscellaneous Pledges\nVouchers of up to £5,000 for energy-saving home improvements as part of a wider £3bn plan to cut emissions\nA pledge to provide 30,000 new traineeships for young people in England\nA £1.6bn package for the arts and heritage sector\nThe doubling of front line staff at job centres, as well as an extra £32m for recruiting extra careers advisers and £17m for work academies in England\nDetails of how the Government will pay for the package are likely to be unveiled in the chancellor’s Autumn Budget.\nMy thoughts\nBritain should have had a Back to Work Budget today, but the announcements fail to face up to the scale of the challenge our country faces. The Eat out to Help out policy feels less like a strategic plan to rebuild hospitality than a calculated publicity stunt to distract from the hard truth that the Government have failed to get a grip of the health crisis and have failed to get a grip of the subsequent economic crisis.\nWe wait to see the detail on the plans the Chancellor laid out on furlough, but so far it doesn’t appear to be targeted enough.\nThe risk is that the Chancellor will waste billions by policy making on the hoof that doesn’t protect jobs. The hardest hit sectors will find the £1000 per employee make little difference to their outlay. The Government doesn’t seem to recognise the simple fact that some sectors of the economy need sustained support. They were too slow into lockdown, too slow on PPE and too slow on testing. Now it runs the real risk of being too slow on jobs and the economy.\nMany sectors are in trouble not because people want money off meals – but because customers don’t have the confidence to return yet. The Government needs to get Test, Track and Isolate operational. They need to restore confidence in the health response so that the economy can grow. That confidence will only return when the Government takes meaningful action to join up its health and economic response. The failure to match soaring rhetoric with meaningful action has consequences for real people.\nThe loss of jobs and closure of companies also comes at a time when we need to tackle the Climate Crisis. Germany announced a 130 billion Euro Package with 30 Billion Euro for Energy and the Climate and 9 Billion Euros specifically for Hydrogen, which would mean it overtakes the UK as the leading European Nation on Hydrogen Technology.\nThe UK Government committed £3 billion to its entire energy and climate change stimulus package, mainly on grants for homeowners and landlords to improve insulation. Tackling just one part of our challenge, one which doesn’t create sustainable jobs as once the insulation is installed the job is done! The UK Government must match Germany and other nations level of ambition or we will be left further behind with a longer recession, higher emissions and more widespread poverty – sadly the same story as the last 10 years!\nDespite all its talk, the Government has failed to produce a clear system for local lockdowns. The key to getting the economy moving and customers back on the high street is confidence in public health measures. Government must act not just to deal with unemployment as a symptom – but with its cause. This was a missed opportunity for the Chancellor to abandon his one-size-fits-all approach to the Job Retention schemes.\nThe accompanying documents are very thin. Government will need to provide much more detail in the coming days so that businesses get the confidence they need.\nLocal restrictions and reopenings\nPlaygrounds and outdoor gyms\nHealth protection regulations 2020 specified that playgrounds should be closed and they consequently have been since March. Following the recent Government announcement about the opening of playgrounds and outdoor gyms from the 4th July the Government has issued non statutory guidance in relation to reopening these facilities.\nThis guidance has significant implications relating to risk assessment, cleaning and social distancing that need to be considered and arrangements put in place. Leeds City Council has 200 playgrounds and outdoor gyms comprising of over 2000 items of individual equipment located within its parks and open spaces and this provides significant challenges in terms of scale and risk prevention. Subsequently this means that opening sites on the 4th July is not possible.\nThe council is currently assessing what cleaning arrangements could be implemented to allow some limited opening at those sites where staff oversight is possible. It is inevitable that the reopening of playgrounds will be delayed.\nMuseums & Galleries\nOur Museums and Galleries service has announced provisional reopening dates for its 9 sites across the city These dates may still subject to change as the Council continue to develop procedures to ensure the safety of all our staff and visitors. Some areas may also remain closed if they cannot accommodate social distancing etc. The provisional reopening dates are as follows (The Visitor Centre and Art Gallery Shop have already reopened):\nJuly 17th: Lotherton House and Kirkstall Abbey\nJuly 21st: Leeds Art Gallery\nJuly 23rd: Leeds Discovery Centre\nJuly 28th: Leeds Industrial Museum\nAug 2nd: Temple Newsam House\nAug 4th: Abbey House\nAug 11th: Leeds City Museum and Thwaite Watermill\nCare Homes\nI was appalled to hear Boris Johnson’s comments on Care Homes this week saying that they “didn’t really follow the procedures” to protect residents and staff from coronavirus. We know that in Leeds North West, care homes were imploring the Government to protect them with adequate testing and PPE.\nI spent weeks gathering up as much PPE as I could myself and delivering it. It is not ok for the Prime Minister, the leader of our country, to shirk his responsibility and blame care homes for this disaster. They deserve better.\nBusinesses reopening from Monday 13th July\nBeauticians\nPhysiotherapist\nTattoo shops\nNail Bars\nSpas\nTanning Salons\nAny facial treatments will not be allowed.\n‘ASK ALEX’\nJoin me every Saturday on Facebook Live at 2pm, where I will be discussing the latest information on Coronavirus.

That universal credit cut has now taken place and the Government have still not addressed the issue of energy costs for of my constituents.”\nAlex stated that “The Labour Party has also laid out our plan to help combat these huge increases to energy costs. It must not be forgotten that we have arrived here because the government over the last decade have relied too heavily on importing energy, whereas the focus should have been on increasing our own energy supplies with more focus on decarbonisation of energy and Government investment in non-gas low carbon domestic heating. “\nLabour would bring in fully-funded measures now to reduce the expected price rise in April – saving most households around £200 or more, but targeted extra support to squeezed middle, pensioners and the lowest earners, receiving up to £600 off bills and preventing all of the increase in energy bills currently expected.\nThey would pay for this with a one-off windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas producers who have profited from price rises.\nHighlighting how crucial it is to keep energy bills lower in future, Labour have said they would:\nReduce Britain’s reliance on imported gas by accelerating home-grown renewables and new nuclear\nMake sure 19 million homes are warm and well-insulated, saving households an average of £400 a year on bills\nRegulate the market better, with a pledge to never again let energy companies play fast and loose with the rules\nAlex reiterated that “as the chair of the All-party parliamentary group on net zero, our action plan looks at building an expansive and ambitious covid-19 green recovery package that focuses on green job creation and workforce retooling, especially in disadvantaged areas.\nThis includes looking at the growth of solar installers and the reintroduction of the feed-in tariff, (a government programme designed to promote the uptake of renewable and low-carbon electricity generation technologies).\nDecarbonisation through heat pumps, electric heating or hydrogen would also present opportunities for SMEs as installers. All those things present a huge opportunity to create new SMEs and new jobs within them, but they need the business support, investment, incentives and targets, and an ecosystem that creates the opportunity for net zero for SMEs and business at large.”\nAlex also said he was in full agreement with Ed Milband MP (Shadow Climate change and Net Zero secretary) who said “The Government failed to regulate the market, failed to protect our gas storage, failed to accelerate the renewable and nuclear transition, and failed to insulate homes.”\nAlex concluded “Once again Labour and many Conservative MP’s are calling on the Government to take immediate action and ease the burden of not only people of low incomes but many on middle incomes who are also feeling the squeeze, not only due to energy costs, but increases in fuel and food costs and facing higher taxation in April”",

As your MP and a father myself it is of great concern. Cuts to Children’s services over the last decade has had a tremendous negative affect on young people.\nThe Children’s Society has been measuring children’s well-being for over a decade, and during much of this time it has been in decline.\nThere is certainly no doubt in my mind that children’s health is a national priority. The Government must focus determinedly on improving the health and well-being of every child.\nI have raised the issue of mental health provisions in schools a number of times in Parliament, via written questions. These questions and the answers from relevant ministers can be viewed by following the links below:\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department is taking to improve access to mental health services in schools.\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps his Department is taking to improve access to on-campus counselling for students at Universities in England.\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Education, if she will bring forward proposals to encourage universities and other higher education providers to improve access to mental health services for students.\nThe Good Childhood Report 2020 found that 15-year olds in the UK were among the saddest and least satisfied with their lives in Europe. The report further found that the coronavirus pandemic affected children’s happiness negatively due to the lack of choice they had in life.\nThis eye-opening report lays bare the stark pressures and difficulties faced by young people in the UK, compared to those in other European countries. Children and young people have been left behind long before coronavirus, but throughout this pandemic they have not been prioritised for the support they need.\nWith children in the UK ranking lowest for life satisfaction across Europe, I am concerned this shows that the Government is out of touch with the real struggles faced by young people.\nIt is time for the Government to finally provide a comprehensive measurement of children’s well-being in order to properly quantify changes and target resources.\nI will certainly be pressing the Government to do this and provide the necessary funding required to ensure are children can access services and support they may require.\nAll details are correct at date of publication shown at the top of the article",

In a meeting of the environmental audits committee, of which Alex Sobel is a member, Alex questioned the project manager of the #OneLess campaign:\n“Do you think that there is scope to look at the licences of take-aways and fast food places so they have to provide access to tap water because that’s the area where you see a lot of littering and food on the go?”\nResponding to Alex, Fiona Llewellyn project manager of the #OneLess campaign said:\n“One of the reasons we have plastic packaged water is that it is convenient to have on the go, so if we can overcome some of the barriers to convenience for refilling that would be a wonderful step in the right direction to this wider problem of plastic pollution and what you suggest would be very welcome.”\nThe panel discussed the pros and cons of introducing a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles, something that is already in place in several European countries, to curtail the amount of plastic waste that is produced in England and Wales. Drinks giant Coca-Cola were previously against such a move but have recently softened their position and are ready to support a planned proposal for a scheme in Scotland.\nSpeaking afterwards Alex said “It was pleasing to see progress made to encourage recycling in a practical and productive way. We must look to other countries where we can clearly see a benefit to introducing a scheme like this- Denmark manages to recycle 90% of it’s plastic bottles where we only manage to collect around 57% in the UK.”\n“…Allowing refills of plastic bottles in take away restaurants would mean less plastic waste, particularly at motorway service stations. These solutions may appear small but when this is put together with other recycling schemes it can quickly add up and make a real difference.”",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_west-papua-the-world-s-forgotten-injustice/content_83.html": "West Papua – the world’s forgotten injustice\n- Alex Sobel\n- Oct 2, 2018\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nWe think we know all about the great injustices of the world. The peoples who have been killed, their human rights transgressed, illegally imprisoned and their call for a right to Self-Determination unanswered. We all know about the peoples of Kurdistan, Western Sahara, Kashmir, Tibet and Palestine.\nHowever much less is spoken of West Papua even though the International Headquarters of the Campaign to fight for against Human Rights abuses and self-determination is based right here in the UK.\nWest Papua is the Western half of the Island of New Guinea off the North coast of Australia sharing the Island with Papua New Guinea which achieved its Independence from Australia in 1975.\nHowever, the Western part of the Island which was a Dutch Colony is under occupation by the Indonesian State. The indigenous people of the Island of New Guinea are Papuans of Melanesian descent quite distinct from the majority of Indonesians.\nThe History of the Struggle for West Papua\nThere was a chance for Independence as the Dutch prepared for de-colonisation after the Second World War they included West Papua in these plans. West Papua held a Congress at which its people declared independence, and raised their new flag – the Morning Star in 1961.\nHowever, Indonesia which had been Independent since 1950 wanted all of the former Dutch colonies in the Asia-Pacific region and the Indonesian military invaded West Papua. As it was the Cold War the Indonesians unable to secure enough support for its invasion of West Papua went to the Soviet Union for help.\nThe US government was worried that Indonesia seeking Soviet support might increase the spread of communism in the Pacific. In a letter from John F Kennedy to the Dutch Prime Minister, the US government strongly urged the Dutch government to hand over West Papua to Indonesia, in an attempt to appease the Sukarno government.\nThe US government managed to engineer a meeting between Indonesia and the Netherlands resulting in the New York Agreement, which in 1962 gave control of West Papua to the United Nations and one year later transferred administrative control to Indonesia. The Papuans were never consulted on this decision.\nHowever, the agreement did promise them their right to self-determination – a right which is guaranteed by the UN to all people in the world. The Indonesians used the next 7 years to gain control over all aspects of West Papuan life and in 1969 the promised plebiscite on Independence came. However rather than a vote of all people in West Papua the Indonesian military hand-picked just 1,026 ‘representative’ people who voted under duress and West Papua became a province of Indonesia.\nMilitary Occupation and Human Rights\nIn the 50 years of Indonesian Control there is significant evidence of Genocide and Yale Law School in a report for the Indonesian Human Rights Campaign in 2004 found “in the available evidence a strong indication that the Indonesian government has committed genocide against the West Papuans”.\nThe Indonesian Military have also carried out widespread acts of Torture and Sexual Assault against the native Papuans. Every week those protesting for their rights are imprisoned by the Military. You may now be asking yourself why haven’t I heard about this, why isn’t this on the news? Well reporting is banned, Journalists cannot travel to West Papua and Journalists that have tried have been expelled.\nIn February 2018 the BBC sent a Journalist to cover the Measles and Malnutrition Crisis that engulfed West Papua was expelled by the Military before she could even file a report.\nWithout any reporting the plight of the West Papuans needs to be carried by word of mouth and Social Media.\nEconomy and Environment\nWest Papua is rich with natural resources it has the world’s largest Gold Mine and second largest Copper Mine. West Papua has also seen mass deforestation with the native trees being replaced by Palms for Palm Oil production. West Papuans are being exploited for their labour, land and their Island is being destroyed by pollution of the land and rivers.\nHowever, the West Papuan people sat in the midst of all these resources are some of the poorest people in Asia.\nHow are the West Papuans campaigning for Self-Determination\nThe people of West Papua have been campaigning since 1969 and many have had to flea and campaign from their new homes. A United Campaign representing all those in the West Papuan diaspora and in West Papua.\nThe United Liberation Movement for West Papua was formed in 2014 bringing together all the Liberation Organisations together. The Free West Papua Campaign is based in the UK and supports the All Party Parliamentary Group on West Papua which I chair. Benny Wenda who lives in Oxford is the Chair of the Free West Papua Campaign and also The United Liberation Movement for West Papua.\nThe bringing together of the organisations has led to two major steps forward recently, the first is the signing of the Westminster Declaration which calls for an Internationally Supervised Vote for Independence and was signed on 2016 by representatives of Governments of 4 Pacific States and Parliamentarians from around the world, since then other Parliamentarians including me have signed up to the Declaration.\nThe West Papuans in secret and often in fear of discovery collected a petition in West Papua calling for an internationally supervises vote for Independence was signed by 1.8 million, Benny Wenda has presented the petition to the UN but was rebuffed after pressure from the Indonesian Government who sit on the UN Decolonisation Committee, how Colonising Nations can be on a Decolonisation Committee is a travesty in itself.\nThe Free West Papua Campaign and All Party Parliamentary Group priority in the UK is to get the UK Government and support the Governments of other nations to get the West Papuans claims heard by the UN.\nYou can help by asking your MP to support us and join the APPG. To get more involved you can sign up to the Free West Papua Campaign and help create awareness locally.",

The Secretary of State replied, “We have made available £5.2 billion, and this is a significant increase in the capital programme over the next few years.\nIncluded in that is some dedicated work on property resilience, where we are working with communities and flood forums locally to identify how we can improve the resilience of individual properties and, when there is a flood incident, to make grants available to them so that they can replace some of their doors in order to be more flood-ready in future.”\nIn a statement following his question, Alex said, In England, over 5.2 million homes and businesses are at risk from flooding. I am pleased that, after many delays and two major flooding incidents, the Otley Flood Alleviation scheme has now completed, bringing the town’s flood risk from 20% to a little over 4%.\nHowever, there are still significant problems. As the Met Office has found, due to climate change, the UK is getting wetter. This means extreme weather events are becoming more and more likely. Yet nationally, flood response funding has been cut while fire and rescue services have lost more than 11,000 workers since 2010. I welcome the £5.2 billion over the next five years, but there is no obvious plan or indication of how or where that money will be spent.\nHe continued, “we need a flood preparedness taskforce that includes regional leaders and frontline services to ensure communities in England are protected from the combined dangers of flooding and Covid this winter. The Government must also come clean on the distribution of the grants promised to those whose homes and businesses were affected by floods – some may not receive funds for more than 2 years.\nHe finishes, “the devastation of Boxing Day 2015 was avoidable. The flooding that has happened since then was avoidable. With the right plan, future flooding events are avoidable too”",

I was not called to speak at the debate though I did manage to intervene. Some events mentioned in the speech have since changed or developed.\nThank You Mr Speaker\nThis weekend I looked with dismay and apprehension at the advance of Taliban Forces in Afghanistan.\nOn July 8th President Biden said, ‘The likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.’ An analysis this Government didn’t seem to disagree with.\nIt didn’t have to be like this. The UK and US Government should have planned for the worst rather than the best case scenario. Instead, our Government are in part responsible for the speed of the collapse of the Afghan Government and therefore there is now an urgent duty of care for the United Kingdom and the international community to offer support to the people of Afghanistan.\nThe US and NATO have more troops at present in Afghanistan than they had six months ago. Yet they seem to be struggling to secure the airport. If the whole world can see the error, it doesn’t take someone with the nous of Otto Von Bismark to realise it.\nThe world must not look away and allow a grave international security crisis, refugee and humanitarian catastrophe to unfold. We must extend our support for the Afghan people and mourn the loss of human life and the displacement of people fleeing the Taliban offensive.\nThere will be time in this chamber in future to analyse over 40 years of strategic and tactical failures which have led the events we are seeing now. This includes the 2001 invasion. I opposed this offensive as, although the destruction of the World Trade Center was a horrific act of terrorism, I felt then that it would have been far better to use security and intelligence rather than a ground war to tackle Al Qaeda. But, having invaded the country, NATO has a responsibility towards Afghan citizens and must not now hold up the humanitarian effort.\nIt was clear days ago that the rapid withdrawal of Military support was a strategic error, and the UK must now use all its international influence through NATO and the UN Security Council to support the creation of create safe havens and safe routes for those internally displaced, with the Panjshir Valley still free of the Taliban. It is also vital that the UK Government announce that all processes which could lead to the deportation of Afghan nationals from the UK to Afghanistan will stop immediately.\nThe Government must work with international partners to ensure all borders around Afghanistan remain open and the UK must provide support for refugees including safe, legal routes to the UK for those fleeing as part of a co-ordinated international effort. Reassurance, including financial aid, must be issued to support those seeking refuge and in camps in third countries.\nThe decision by the UK Government to slash aid spending and shut down the Department for International Development must not be an impediment to providing aid.\nTargets for assassination in Afghanistan such as women’s rights campaigners, interpreters, academics, journalists, trade unionists, civil servants, and civil society leaders must be protected. The UK should call for immediate protection of all vulnerable groups and grant humanitarian protection VISAs as a matter of urgency to all these groups not a measly 5000 people.\nThe UK needs to consider carefully any recognition of the Taliban as the Government of Afghanistan, and all that entails in terms of diplomatic access.\nThere is also the delivery of humanitarian aid during the continuing Covid epidemic which means Afghanistan needs both food and medical aid. The UK must work with NGOs and international agencies to create secure areas where support can be delivered. Having failed the Afghan people militarily, failing to rapidly intervene to prevent a humanitarian disaster, creating greater instability and insecurity is simply not an option.\nThe Prime Minister needs to use what influence he has left to beseech Afghanistan’s neighbours to use any leverage they have to seek to protect civilian life. The UK and international community must seek to freeze the assets and apply sanctions to those who, overtly or covertly, support the Taliban.\nAfghanistan must never be allowed to return to being a training ground and support base for international terrorism.\nRapid co-ordinated international action is needed now and the UK has a moral and historical duty to act. This is not the time to be distracted by blame games or finger-pointing, we need to save lives.",

They will also develop facilities to support the ever-growing number of staff and volunteers.\nKate Moree and Cate Hyde started Seagulls reuse in 2001. They now employ 18 people, 90% of whom were previously volunteers.\nAlex Sobel, who sits on the environmental audit committee in Parliament and chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Social Enterprise, has pledged his support for the campaign.\nHe said “It was a pleasure to visit Seagulls, an organisation I know very well from my days working with social enterprises in Leeds. The new shop is looking fantastic and I hope that they raise the money to further what they do for recycling and help more people in our city. It was fascinating to hear about how they help people who have come out of prison gain skills and re-enter the workforce. It was also heart-warming to hear about all the work that they are doing with people who have mental health issues.”\nKate Moree of Seagulls Reuse said; “All profit that we make (whether it’s from paint sales or mosaic workshops) gets put back into the business. This sustains a volunteer program that benefits both people and the planet.\nDespite having gone from strength to strength, we aren’t resting on their laurels anytime soon. In 2017, 375 tonnes of paint were collected, twice the amount of the first year. The growth in the need for our services coupled with the desire to employ more people and expand the range of services offered means we need to develop more space.\nI am pleased that we have the support of a local MP, especially one who knows what it means to run a social enterprise and appreciates the benefit we have to the environment as well as to mental health in Leeds.”\nCat Hyde said “It’s great to have Alex’s support. More and more paint comes through our doors every day, which means the team must ensure it has enough resources to continue doing great work. We’ve taken on the space needed to do this and now need funds to make these ideas a reality.\nThe spirit of “people power” is a huge part of what makes Seagulls great. We already receive great support from the local community and are looking for more people to be a part of this and contribute to ongoing success.”\nPlease support seagulls Reuse at the below link\nFor more information or to contact seagulls please contact cat and kate on info@seagullsreuse.org.uk\nTel: 0113 2467501",

Iconic UK landmarks, including the London Eye, Liverpool’s Liver Building, and Buckingham Palace, will be turning off their lights in a show of solidarity.\nBut its impact has gone far beyond just turning off lights for one hour. Earth Hour is a time to switch off from distractions and focus on doing something – anything – positive for our planet.\nAlex explained that ‘Here in the UK, we are already one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. We are the most nature-depleted country in the G7 and the G20. A further quarter of UK mammals are now at risk of extinction. From puffins to bluebells, bumblebees and mountain hares, UK wildlife is feeling the heat and struggling to adapt.\nGlobally, a broken food system is driving ill health, poorly rewarding farmers, and is responsible for one third of greenhouse gas emissions - and most of the biodiversity loss and land degradation.’\nHe continued ‘If you imagine that London was a country, the emissions financed from the City of London alone would be the 9th largest emitter in the world. WWF is calling on politicians like myself, to show their commitment to tackling what they’re calling the ‘triple challenge’ - ensuring how we use our land and seas supports our climate, nature, and food security.’\nAlex emphasised that ‘We are in the fight of our lives to fix our broken food and finance systems for people and the planet - a race to bring our world back to life.\nIf action is taken, by the end of this decade, greenhouse gas emissions could be halved, nature and wildlife could be recovering all around us, and habitats could be beginning to thrive again. The simple act of turning off the lights can influence positive changes through collective, global action whilst giving hope for the future.",

I am pleased to report that as of yesterday, families of NHS and social care staff who die from COVID-19 in the course of essential frontline work will receive a £60,000 payment.\nI am pleased that our campaign has been successful and that NHS staff will have the benefits we would expect anyone working on the front line to have. The most important thing now is to ensure our NHS staff are fully protected so that we do not see front line staff losing their lives to this virus\nWorkers Memorial Day\nToday is workers memorial day, as said in my introduction I will be joining the minutes silence at 11am to mark my respects for all those who have died at work during this crisis. My heart goes out to the families of all those who have died from this in the course of their work, including NHS staff, care workers, shop staff and transport workers.\nBut respect is not enough. We must redouble efforts to ensure that people are protected at work. We can do this by ensuring adequate protection equipment, by constantly reviewing policies and by ensuring that our workplaces are only staffed by those who are absolutely essential in the fight to tackle this virus. In this vain I will continue to fight for the rights of telecomms workers, to demand better for our care staff and to fight for every worker who is currently in harms way.\nMy office\nMy office continues to remain open for everyone who needs us. There have been reports in the news this morning of MPs offices being overwhelmed with queries at this time. Whilst this is as true for us as for everywhere else, we will continue to work to get people the answers they need. What I would ask for is to give us time to respond to you and to try to resist contacting us if you do not have an urgent enquiry.\nRecording of deaths\nAn update on the broader picture of deaths in Leeds. This information is from the Leeds registrar which feeds through the Office of National Statistics. The important caveat on this data is that not all the cases included in these figures will have been tested, but the death certificate includes a reference to COVID being a cause or contributing factor to the death. The cumulative picture for the city is: 307 covid-19 related deaths registered since 27th March, 296 (96%) were Leeds residents, 199 (65%) were in hospitals, 83 (27%) were in care homes, 8 (3%) in a hospice, and 17 (6%) in their own home. To date, 31% of all deaths registered since 27 March have been Covid-19 related. We don’t want to forget that behind all these numbers are people, with families and friends who are grieving, and our thoughts are with those families affected.\nParliament\nI challenged the Minister to follow in the footsteps of France where their strategy for the tourism industry including flexible furlough, 100% state back loan and the encouragement of postponement not cancellation of holidays through Government backing credit refund notes financially.\nI am glad to be breaking new ground in this virtual Parliament era.",

In an answer to a written parliamentary question, Minister for Transport Jo Jonson explained that the franchise was to run out of money ‘in due course’ and that this has caused the Department to consider its options—one of which being the renationalisation of the line.\nIn a written question to the Department of Transport, Alex Sobel, MP for Leeds North West, wrote:\n“To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what assessment he has made of the potential merits of public ownership for East Coast Mainline in the event that the franchise ends early.” (131565 07 March 2018)\nThe answer came from Minister of State for Transport, Jo Johnson:\n“Since 2015 the East Coast franchise has met all its financial commitments to the taxpayer, returning nearly £1 billion to the public purse. But this has come at a substantial cost of almost £200 million to Stagecoach. It is now clear that this franchise will in due course run out of funds and only be able to continue in its current form for a small number of months and no more.\nThe Government is therefore currently reviewing two options for the continuation of services on the East Coast. One is to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the service under a very strictly designed short-term arrangement. The second is for the franchise to be directly operated by the Department for Transport, through an operator of last resort. The Department will choose the option that offers best value for money for taxpayers and protects the interests of passengers. This assessment is ongoing, and a conclusion of the best option has not yet been reached.” (12 March 2018)\nAlex Sobel, who has been the Labour member of Parliament for Leeds North West since June last year said: “It is clear that the franchising of the successful publicly run East Coast mainline was going to end in disaster. The Government have now admitted this and are planning to either carry on seeing Stagecoach fail in the short term or bring East Cost into public ownership, where they should have left it all along. I call on Chris Grayling to do the right thing for passengers and taxpayers and return East Coast back to the people.”",

My sincere thoughts and deep condolences are with those who have lost family and friends.\nWe’ve all been through a lot in this last year. We’ve stayed home but we’ve come together. We’ve cried, we’ve clapped for our carers, we’ve mourned, we’ve celebrated the vaccine, we’ve lost, and we’ve loved. I’m so proud at the way our community and country has responded and come together.\nTo commemorate the day, buildings across Leeds will be lit up in yellow, with the flags at half-mast to remember those so tragically lost over the last year and think of those grieving.\nWe’ve got through a lot collectively in the last year. I hope you can join me, the Leeds North West and wider UK community in coming together on our doorsteps this evening at 8pm for a doorstep vigil to mark this emotional day.\nLooking forward to the future, there are positive signs on the horizon. Covid cases continue to decrease in Leeds North West and elsewhere, the vaccination rollout is proving effective, and we are all pulling together to ensure a safe and efficient roadmap to ending lockdown restrictions remains in sight.",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_my-plastic-free-week-what-i-ve-learned/content_262.html": "My Plastic Free Week: What I’ve Learned\n- Alex Sobel\n- Jun 11, 2018\n- 2 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nYesterday I finished my plastic free week, where I attempted to not buy any single-use plastic to mark my first anniversary in Parliament. This was a task designed, not as show of will power or to shame people for their shopping habits, but to highlight the proliferation of plastic and just how difficult it is to live without it. Below are some things that I have learned.\nParliament need to practice what they preach\nBy far the trickiest place to go plastic free was inside the House of Commons. Every snack or food stuff comes in plastic packaging, plastic coffee cups accompany MPs and staff in every corridor, plastic cups are stacked next to the water dispensers and plastic sachets of sauce dominate the canteens (I looked it up, the house uses 334,800 sachets of sauce a year). If we hope to convince the country to go plastic free, we must set a better example.\nShop Local\nFresh fruit and veg at the People’s Supermarket\nOne of the joys of this challenge was the necessity to shop in small local outlets rather than big superstores. Not only did it provide me with fresh plastic free produce, but it helped me feel closer to my community.\nSmall businesses lead the way\nI have learned a lot about plastic free in my constituency. Businesses such as I Am Döner in Headingley are an example to the bigger outlets that you can run an eatery without producing plastic waste. Many more are taking heed and offering plastic free options – this is to be welcomed.\nBeware MPs bearing gifts\nMy only slip in the week was during a debate in Parliament. I got quite emotional during a speech about anti-Semitism and was kindly handed a cup of water by my fellow MP Stephen Pound in a plastic cup.\nChallenges are best when they are shared\nI was touched by all the messages I received by constituents who were undertaking this challenge with me. Please do keep your stories coming.\nDecisive change will not occur through the shopping trolleys of individuals but in the actions of Government and business in ensuring that plastic consumption is dramatically and rapidly reduced. However, by being mindful of our own consumption we can choose options that do not incentivise plastic and be part of the change we want to see.",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_coronavirus-update-monday-27th-april/content_463.html": "Coronavirus update Monday 27th April\n- Alex Sobel\n- Apr 27, 2020\n- 5 min read\nI hope this update finds you well and that you have had a pleasant weekend. I am sad to report that the UK death rate from COVID-19 stands at 20,732. In Leeds, we have seen 1209 confirmed cases and 150 deaths in hospital. Passing 20,000 deaths in the UK is a grim milestone to have reached. This figure does not include those who have died at home or in our care homes. Again, this underlines the clear message that we must all do everything that we can to stay at home and save lives.\nLockdown\nWe are into our sixth week of lockdown. In general compliance has been very good and I have been touched to see how well we are all working together in the interest of others and in protecting the health of our nation. That said, there are early signs of lockdown fatigue and the fact that we are in the dark about how long this might last for and what preparations are being done to recover from this crisis is not helping. Below are the five tests the Government have set out as to when we might see lockdown relaxed.\nWe must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.\nWe need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.\nWe need to have reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.\nWe need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.\nWe need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.\nThese are not unreasonable measures to look to and it is understandable that we may not be able to tell yet, how long meeting these tests will take. That said, we know that there are discussions in cabinet today regarding how we might end lockdown when the time comes. We believe that the British public must be part of that conversation. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said at the weekend, “The British public have made great sacrifices to make the lockdown work. They deserve to be part of an adult conversation about what comes next. If we want to take people with us and secure their consent, this is necessary now.”\nPPE\nThank you to all those who have contacted me over the weekend with suggestions of where to find PPE. My team will leave no stone unturned on this. We are also compiling a list of businesses that sell PPE and will pass on that list to our care homes, GPs and hospices also. I am also very aware that there are several other areas where PPE is not available. Supermarket staff, dentists and school staff for example all have good reason to have access to protection and we must work to an end where everyone who may need protection may get some. There were also reports in the media at the tail end last week regarding problems with PPE at a Leeds hospital and I am looking into that as well.\nIf there is anyone who may have access to PPE or is able to make some please do contact alex@alexsobel.co.uk\nPublic transport – social distancing measures on buses.\nWest Yorkshire is operating at around 40-50% mileage on buses, operating to a largely hourly service with priority to key worker travel needs. Ridership is 13% of usual levels with elderly/ disabled free bus pass use at 10% of normal level. I have received the below update as to the standards being set on our buses. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our bus drivers, who are putting themselves at risk every day keeping our other key workers moving.\nCleaning / hygiene- higher standard of cleaning especially touchpoints, drivers issued with hand sanitiser\nDriver protection/ PPE – bus companies that didn’t have “assault screens” are fitting them and are sealing where necessary to reduce air flow. All WY buses are single door so no opportunity to use middle/ end doors as in London.\nSome companies giving drivers gloves, no masks in use (as per WHO/ PHE guidance for non clinical use of masks however the Mayor of London is pushing for mask use by public transport workers\nSocial Distancing – operators putting signs / floor markings etc to promote social distancing.\nDuplicate buses put on busy trips. Specific guidance on social distancing and buses awaited from Department of Transport. They are promoting contactless payment but have not withdrawn cash due to concerns about social exclusion implications of this. Nationally Arriva introduced exact fare only from this week- monitoring the impact of this.\nHoliday cancellations\nIf an airline cancels a flight, then there is European Regulation to protect the consumer. The airline must issue a full cash refund or allow the consumer to rebook for a future date. The passenger should make a claim for a cash refund to the airline or through the travel company.\nFCO advice means that flights cannot leave the UK. Any refund on the cost of the accommodation would depend on the contractual terms of the booking. Airbnb currently states on its website that travellers can cancel reservations made on or before 14 March 2020, with a check in date of 14 March – 14 April 2020.\nPackage holidays have the benefit of financial protection. This means the consumer may be entitled to a refund should the operator become insolvent. If the operator cancels any element of the package holiday, the consumer has the right to request a full cash refund. The consumer must claim the refund within 14 days of the cancellation.\nA consumer whose operator has cancelled the holiday should check with their travel insurer. Much would depend on the type of insurance bought. You can access legal advice free of charge from Citizens Advice Bureaus. There is also useful consumer information on the ABTA, ABI and GOV.UK websites.\nVets\nUK vets are urgently calling on the government to grant vet practices business rates relief, as COVID-19 restrictions mean many practices face closure, risking the health of millions of animals. During the COVID-19 crisis, vets are obliged by law to continue administering urgent and emergency care, while current government guidelines prevent practices from providing their full range of services.\nTurnover has plummeted by more than 75% for nearly a quarter of vets, with two-thirds of practices seeing turnover slashed by 50% or more. While retailers, pet shops and a range of other businesses are eligible for rates relief, veterinary practices are specifically excluded. This is causing many vets to close and will certainly increase the risks to animals and the anxiety of pet owners. Likewise with dentists and nurseries, the Government must carefully consider businesses that fall outside of the current help on offer and step in to save crucial businesses from closure.",

In the event of our leaving the EU without a deal, we will have no method of protecting our environment—investigating and prosecuting environmental crimes—without this Bill going through Parliament, so when are we to expect its First Reading? How will sufficient time be made available to ensure this Bill is passed before 29 March?”\nAndrea Leadsom, Leader of the House, did not commit to a timetable instead saying that it was “not right to say that there will be no means at all to protect our environment” and that they had “a 25-year environment plan for England that demonstrates our ambition to be the first generation to leave our environment in a better place than we found it.”\nMr Sobel recently confirmed his support for a new referendum or ‘people’s vote’ and took to the floor of the house to remind the Government that there is a greater mandate for protecting the Good Friday agreement, which won an emphatic referendum in 1998, is not mandated for in the current agreement and would be wiped out under a no-deal Brexit.\nHe said, “We have had two referendums on this, so this would be the third referendum in which people have been allowed a say about membership of the EU? We also had a referendum in Northern Ireland on the Good Friday agreement, which resulted in a 71% majority. Should not that referendum result be respected, which it is not in the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement?”",

In my letter to planning inspectors I sert out the below reasons:\nWhilst I appreciate and welcome provision within the application for dwellings available for those on Housing Association lists, the vast majority of dwellings will be four and five bedroomed. There is not a shortage of housing for this market, particularly in Adel and Wharfedale. A fair housing mix is important and new houses in the area must be genuinely affordable, particularly for first time buyers, young families or for those looking to downsize.\nCare must be taken to preserve the historic heritage of the area. The proposed site would neighbour a 12th Century Norman church. In 2014, English Heritage recommended that “the design and materials of any new development reflects the local built character” and use “high quality, local materials.” There is a great concern locally that BDWH would not be planning to take this into consideration. It should also be noted that Historic England have consistently opposed any built development East of the Beck due to the historic importance of St. Johns the Baptist Church. BDWH propose to build a pumping station to the East of the Beck.\nThe proposed housing would be built on greenfield land. There are spaces in Leeds suitable for this number of dwellings which would not have to be built on greenfield.\nI hope that the concerns of residents will be taken into account and addressed. There have been many objections to this site lodged by residents via the public access website.\nYou can make a public objection via this website http://www.leeds.gov.uk/publicaccess quoting the application number 18/04343",

Please find today’s update below. I am pleased to see this morning’s announcement regarding expanding tests for key workers, in particular for the care sector. There is still a lot to be seen about how this will work in practice and a lot more to be developed regarding contact tracing. Tests available is not the same as tests completed and whilst I will do my part to ensure that our care homes understand how and where they can get tests done, a lot more must be done to ensure that tests are completes efficiently and quickly.\nTesting\nTesting has now been opened up to the over 65s and for staff and patients in care homes. This is something we have been pushing for for some time. Testing can be sent out or done at the Leeds Temple Green site.\nTests are available for:\nall essential workers including NHS and social care workers with symptoms (see the full list of essential workers)\nanyone over 65 with symptoms\nanyone with symptoms whose work cannot be done from home (for example, construction workers, shop workers, emergency plumbers and delivery drivers)\nThey will also test anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus that lives with those identified above.\nIn addition, they are also testing:\nsocial care workers and residents in care homes (with or without symptoms) both to investigate outbreaks and, following successful pilots, as part of a rolling programme to test all care homes\nNHS workers and patients without symptoms where there is a clinical need, in line with NHS England guidance\nThis means anyone in one of these groups can find out whether they have the virus. Testing is most effective within 3 days of symptoms developing.\nI will be in touch with our care homes again today to pass on this information as well as to update them as to where we have got to regarding PPE.\nSafer Communities Fund\nWe’ve been made aware by the Police and Crime Commissioner’s office that they currently have an £150,000 extra-ordinary Safer Communities Fund grant running with a specific focus on supporting communities to help deal with the fall out of COVID-19. Community groups can bid for grants of up to £6000 for projects and interventions which target domestic and sexual abuse, child sexual abuse, mental health, fraud and drugs/alcohol services. The money is due to be allocated by the end of May with a view to the projects being delivered over the next 6 months. You can find out more about it on their website.\nDomestic Abuse\nI am aware that the current circumstances create extra tension for families. As a result of this, there is a heightened risk of domestic violence. Domestic violence and abuse can happen to anyone. It can take place in any relationship, irrespective of age, race, sexuality, gender identity, socio-economic background or disability. If you are worried that someone may be at risk, there are many ways you can seek support. Please see below for contact details for local and national support services:\nLeeds Domestic Violence Service (open to all genders) – 24 hour helpline 0113 2460401. You can also email the team administration@leedswomensaid.org.uk or you can access webchat through their website.\nNational Men’s Advice Line – free helpline 0808 8010327. Or email info@mensadviceline.org.uk\nGALOP (LGBT+ Anti Violence Charity) – helpline 0800 999 5428 or email advice@galop.org.uk\nRespect (offers help for domestic abuse perpetrators who want to change.) – free helpline 0808 8024040 or e-mail info@respectphoneline.org.uk\nMore sources of support including national services and resources relating to domestic abuse are available here.\nSocial Care\nIt is vital that social care gets the focus and priority it deserves. Millions of elderly and disabled people and their families depend on these services. Actions will speak louder than words. A growing crisis in social care is being exposed. Alongside today’s announcement on testing, we still need a clear and detailed plan about how – and by when – the Government is going to test more than 1.2 million frontline social care workers. This must include home care staff and Personal Assistants employed through direct payments. People who hospitals discharge into care homes are now going receive tests.The government must spell out how and where those who have tested positive will be isolated. ONS statistics show that the number of deaths in care homes due to Covid-19 was 1,043 up to 10 April. This highlights the terrible toll that coronavirus is having on elderly and disabled people in care homes. Yet these awful figures are only scratching the surface, they are already out of date. The Government must now publish daily figures of Covid-19 deaths outside hospital, including in care homes, so we know the true scale of the problem. This is essential to tackling the spread of the virus.

With significant changes to pet travel now that we have reached the end of the transition period, Dogs Trust is urging MPs to help stop #PuppySmuggling by joining their new parliamentary Puppy Smuggling Taskforce.\nEvery year thousands of puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain to then be sold via online adverts to unsuspecting dog lovers, having been transported thousands of miles across Europe with little water, no food, exercise or toilet breaks. Many suffer significant health problems and/or lifelong behavioural challenges, and some don’t survive, leaving their buyers helpless and heartbroken – as well as out of pocket.\nFor over six years the charity has been calling on Government to end puppy smuggling after exposing this abhorrent trade through four undercover investigations. Current legislation is not fit for purpose – every day of Government delay is causing more preventable suffering for innocent puppies.\nAlex Sobel, MP for Leeds North West, says:\n“I am delighted to join the Puppy Smuggling Taskforce and support Dogs Trust in their efforts to raise awareness of and tackle the abhorrent puppy smuggling trade.\n“At a time when demand for dogs in the UK has never been higher, I want to urge my constituents to really do their research before buying a puppy advertised for sale online, as it’s all too easy to be duped into buying a dog that’s been illegally smuggled into the country.\n“Dogs Trust has been campaigning on this issue for many years now, and I’m proud to be able to say I’m part of the Puppy Smuggling Taskforce to help put a stop to puppies needlessly suffering at the hands of criminals.”\nDogs Trust is calling on the Government to:\nRaise the minimum age for puppies to be imported into the UK to six months to help make them less desirable.*\nBring in tougher penalties for smuggling pups to deter deceitful sellers. Only a handful of cases have ever been prosecuted and you can get a longer sentence for smuggling cigarettes than you can for smuggling puppies.\nTo find out more about our Puppy Smuggling work, visit https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/news-events/issues-campaigns/puppy-smuggling/\nVideo explaining the puppy smuggling trade and information about our latest investigation into online adverts for puppies here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlxTqoCqWgI&feature=youtu.be\nDogs Trust’s Veterinary Director Paula Boyden said:\n“Sadly, we continue to see more and more heart-breaking examples of puppies being illegally imported into the country. Puppy smugglers are making vast profits by exploiting innocent puppies, breeding and transporting them in appalling conditions to sell onto dog lovers here in the UK.\n“There has never been a more urgent need to end the appalling puppy smuggling trade. Enough is enough, Government must take immediate action as too many puppies are suffering at the hands of cruel traders and too many dog lovers are being left to pick up the pieces.\n“We are grateful to Alex Sobel MP for his support in joining the parliamentary Puppy Smuggling Taskforce to stop this cruel trade.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact the press office on 0203 8790536 or email pressoffice@dogstrust.org.uk\n*Dogs Trust supports reintroducing a requirement for a rabies blood (titre) test before entry into the UK, together with a wait period post vaccination which is in line with the incubation period of rabies. This means that the age at which puppies could legally enter the UK would be increased to six months.\nWhat to do to avoid being Dogfished\nSadly, it is all too easy to be scammed into buying a dog which may not be what it seems. We call this Dogfishing. Remember:\nAlways see puppy and mum together at their home and make sure to visit more than once, even if it is via video call due to coronavirus restrictions.\nNever pay a deposit up front without seeing the puppy in person.\nAsk lots of questions and make sure you see all vital paperwork, such as a puppy contract – which gives lots of information about their parents, breed, health, diet, the puppy’s experiences and more.\nIf you have any doubts or feel pressured to buy, as hard as it may be, walk away and report the seller.\nFor more information and advice about how to avoid being misled when buying a puppy advertised online, search ‘Dogfished’ or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk/dogfished\nTogether, with the support of the public, we can ‘Change the Tale’ for smuggled pups by being there to help when they need it most. For more information on how you can help visit www.dogstrust.org.uk/changethetale\nAbout Dogs Trust\nDogs Trust is the UK’s largest dog welfare charity and normally cares for around 14,000 dogs across its network of 20 rehoming centres in the UK and one in Dublin. Dogs Trust has a non-destruction policy and will never put a healthy dog to sleep. The charity also focuses its efforts on understanding dogs and sharing that knowledge with the wider public to prevent problem behaviours that can result in relinquishment or abandonment. We are working towards the day when all dogs can enjoy a happy life, free from the threat of unnecessary destruction.",

He recently conducted a survey of his constituents to judge the level of families struggling either in obtaining an assessment for their child or receiving the necessary treatment following an assessment.\nThese enquires also exposed a distressing gap in the provision of pre-school autism assessments in Leeds. Mr Sobel wrote to the Secretary of State for Health and Social care, Victoria Atkins MP, to ask if she would make an assessment of the adequacy of the number of professionals able to offer pre-school autism assessments in Leeds.\nHis request was answered by Maria Caulfield MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Care revealing there are no concrete plans in place to address this critical issue. It has come to light that the West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board (ICB) has failed to prioritise the urgent need for professionals capable of offering these assessments, leaving countless families in limbo.\nAlex explained that ‘The West Yorkshire ICB's explanation of a temporary suspension of pre-school autism assessments due to a shortage of professionals is simply unacceptable. Families should not be left waiting indefinitely for essential services that directly impact the well-being and development of their children.\nWhile it is encouraging to hear that one full-time equivalent clinical psychologist has been recruited, the timeline for the service to resume operations by the end of June 2024 is far from reassuring. Every day of delay represents a missed opportunity to provide timely support and intervention to those in need.\nFurthermore, the national framework and operational guidance for autism assessment services published by NHS England in April 2023, while a step in the right direction, must be swiftly and effectively implemented at the local level. It is not enough to have guidelines in place if they are not being translated into tangible action and meaningful support for individuals and families affected by autism.’\nAlex is calling for urgent action to address this scandalous oversight and ensure that no child or family in Leeds is left without access to essential autism assessment services.\nAlex concluded ‘The well-being and prospects of our children must be a top priority, and it is incumbent upon the authorities to take immediate steps to rectify this unacceptable situation.’",

He asked about ways we could reduce the impact and threat of these species.\nHe said:\n“Where are the biggest weaknesses in terms of biodiversity in overseas territories and how do we legislate to protect these?”\n“Should protection of biodiversity be built into EU law surrounding overseas territories?”\n“What should the UK government do to minimise biosecurity risks in overseas projects?”\n“What lessons have we learned from completed overseas projects and how can the government use what we’ve learned in future projects.”\nThis garnered an engaged and positive response among academics on the committee and those in the audience.

Mr Sobel obtained confirmation from the library that the refurbishment was not an excuse to permanently close the library. He also asked for details about the installation of solar panels.\nMr Sobel said, “The Library havs categorically confirmed that it will reopen upon completion and that this is set to be Tuesday 23rd April. There have been concerns about the Cross Green temporary facility in town being small and hard to access. The Library has assured me that this was done to keep the library, one-stop service and computer access available locally, whilst the main site was closed for work that was unsafe for the public. Any book in the Leeds catalogue could be ordered from Cross Green. The buzzer access is for safety, as the building also houses Otley Children’s Centre.”\n“It would be fantastic for the library to be fitted with solar panels. When the refurbishment was originally planned, there was no national funding scheme available to make it happen. Otley Town Council have proposed that Leeds applies to the new ‘Smart Export Scheme’ – this is a market driven scheme rather than a subsidy and the city council are looking at the business case for that. I am told that if a viable funding scheme can be found, solar panels will be added when the money is secured.”\n“From April 1st, the Government has scrapped the Feed-In and Export Tariffs which provided payment to communities and individuals in exchange for using and selling clean energy such as solar back to the grid. This premature decision will deter people from new installations, and slow down solar development.”\n“I have been fighting this tooth and nail in Parliament. During my time as a councillor, we secured 1003 solar panels for council houses. It is very disappointing that this funding is being scrapped. I will continue to argue for Feed-In Tariffs as I believe it is vital for communities to have a stake in the battle against climate change.”\nMr Sobel was impressed with the improved facilities that will be on offer at the Library: “There will be interview rooms available to house the Citizens Advice Bureau, which is excellent news for the town. There will be a refreshed stock of books, improved public toilets, décor and facilities for staff. There will also be a much-improved heating system to rectify the fact that many found it either too hot or too cold.”\n“I am excited about the reopening and hope to be there for it if Parliament is not sitting.”",

I supported Frank Field MP’s Holiday Provisions bill earlier this year but unfortunately the call to provide food and activities in the school holidays across the UK was unsuccessful.”\nAlex Sobel has this week visited Otley Food Bank to highlight the role played by\nvolunteers to help tackle the problem.\nHe said “Where the Government has failed it is left to the community to come together and support each other during the school holidays. Otley Food Bank provides food and other essential household supplies around Otley, Yeadon, Guiseley, Menston and Bramhope from donations provided by the community.”\nMr Sobel was keen to stress that it was important that people knew the Food Bank was there for anyone who falls on tough times.\n“Whilst holiday hunger is important to highlight, it is easy for anyone to find themselves in need of a delivery from the foodbank. I was so impressed by the subtle, pragmatic and unjudgmental approach from the volunteers managing the foodbank.”\n“I was impressed by the dedication of Shirley and the volunteers at Otley Food Bank who dedicate so much of their own time to help others.”\nShirley Parker, who manages Otley Food Bank said:\n“We help people from all backgrounds who need us for a variety of different reasons. It is important that people realise that there is no shame in requesting a delivery from the Food Bank. We deliver sensitively so that nobody has to suffer any social repercussions even though we believe that there should be no stigma in asking for help from a Food Bank.\nWe are pleased that Alex is raising the issue of holiday hunger and we hope that the powers at be hear what he has to say and respond.\nWe are pleased to help our community, even though we wish that our services were not needed.”\nNew Weetwood Councillors James Gibson and Christine Knight have used their MICE (small discretional) fund to provide breakfast clubs at the Welcome In Café during the summer holidays.\nSpeaking on Facebook Mr Gibson said “Over 30,000 schoolchildren in Leeds are going hungry in school breaks because many families are struggling to meet the costs of feeding their children over the holidays.\nTo help try and prevent holiday hunger in our area, Councillor Christine Knight and I have teamed up with The Welcome In Café to provide free breakfasts for any child under the age of 16 that wants one.\nThere is no other criteria and you don’t need a referral, just turn up and enjoy a free breakfast at a wonderful local café.”\nResidents can be referred to the Food Bank through professionals such as doctors, health visitors, social workers, Citizens Advice or by contacting their local MP.\nOtley Food Bank provide food parcels to the most vulnerable families and individuals with the Otley area, including Bramhope, Yeadon, Guiseley, Menston and Otley and occasionally provide parcels for Burley in Wharfedale and Ilkley.",

It will allow members of staff from different banks to come into the hub once a week to help customers with trickier transactions.\nThroughout the week, the counter service and machines allow individuals and small business owners to access accounts, and to withdraw and deposit notes and coins.\nHalifax advised that In Otley, branch transactions over the past five years (based on October of each year) dropped by 74% from 2017 to 2022. Each year there has been a steady decline in usage even before Covid and the pandemic has accelerated customers opting to bank with us in different ways, whether that is online, mobile or over the telephone. 81% of customers using the Otley branch have also used other Halifax Branches, online banking or telephone banking. Halifax have confirmed they would like to reassure you that those more vulnerable customers will be contacted by branch colleagues and supported through this transition to alleviate any concerns they may have.\nIn addition to this customers can also carry out both personal and business transactions to withdraw money or check their balance, as well as pay in cash and cheques to their account at the Post Office.\nI am pleased to hear that there are no job losses as a result of this closure, and that all employees affected will be offered roles at other branches or in other parts of our business.\nIf you have any concerns or questions please do not hesitate to get in touch at\nalex@alexsobel.co.uk",

I have spoken to so many small business owners in Otley, Yeadon and across Leeds North West who struggle with the high level of rates that they need to pay.\nThis has driven many out of our high streets already, with only charity shops, who are exempt from business rates, and large businesses able to maintain workable shop fronts. I want to see towns like Otley thriving once more, providing people with great local options, and offering new employment within the town. This policy would be game changing.”\nThe policy to scrap rates, replacing it with a fairer system was announced by the Shadow Chancellor and neighbouring Leeds MP Rachel Reeves at Labour Party Conference. It has been welcomed by industry bodies with Tony Danker, Director General of the CBI saying “Change to this outdated system is chronically overdue.\nThe Labour Party should be applauded for grasping the nettle and putting forward a pro-growth, pro-investment package of reforms.” Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation for small business added “This proposal marks a welcome call to action that would take more small businesses out of the regressive rates system and rightly looks ahead to more fundamental reform.”\nAlex also welcomed the commitment to tackle the Climate Emergency, with the announcement that the next Labour Government would invest £28 billion of capital expenditure on green jobs. Alex, who is chair of the All Party Group on Net Zero, also addressed concerns around the upcoming UN Climate Conference, COP26.\nSpeaking at SERA, Labour’s environment campaign, he said “COP26 is the last, best chance to turn the tide on the climate crisis. The Tories are very poor at delivering. We are not a lone voice; the private sector is saying this: the Government is behind on delivery. The Labour Party in all its forms are there, be it on a council, select committees, we’re doing everything we can.”",

Conferences, theatre and concert performances, and sports events, but numbers will be restricted.\nClose contact, such as hugging, with friends and family. Its important to check with the people you are meeting that they are comfortable with this first.\nCOVID-secure rules remain for the workplace and businesses, such as in shops and hospitality.\nInternational travel can begin to safely, allowing people to go on foreign holidays to ‘green’ list countries. Strict border control measures will remain in place, including pre-departure tests and a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival back in the UK.\nFace coverings will no longer be needed in classrooms or for students in communal areas in secondary schools and colleges. Twice weekly home testing will remain to control infection rates.\nUniversity students can return to in-person teaching and learning and should get tested twice a week upon return.\nUp to 30 people will now be able to attend weddings, receptions, and commemorative events including wakes, as well as standalone life-cycle events.\nThe number of people able to attend a funeral will be determined by the number that can be safely accommodated in the venue with social distancing in place.\n30 people will be able to attend a support group or parent and child group. Children under 5 will not be included in the numbers.\nOrganised adult sport and exercise classes can resume indoors and saunas and steam rooms may reopen.\nCare homes residents will be able to have up to five named visitors. Two visitors able to attend at once provided they are tested and follow infection control measures.\nCare home residents will be able to leave the care home without having to self isolate for 14 days upon return.\nWhilst it is great news that many of our sectors who have remained closed for months can now finally re-open in some form, we must remain vigilant whilst mixing with people to ensure that we do not see a sharp rise in the number of cases. There is still significant concern that new variants, such as the Indian variant, will cause a new spike in cases and possibly deaths from Covid-19. If we are all cautious within the new guidelines, we can hope for a further easing of lockdown restrictions in June.\nMore details on all restrictions can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus",

I know people feel very strongly about this issue.\nI support a ban on the use of electronic shock collars.\nIn my view, no animal should be made to suffer unnecessary pain and degradation, and we must drive up standards and practice in line with the most recent advances and understanding.\nMany animal welfare organisations, including the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club alongside the RSPCA, oppose the use of e-collars and instead promote positive training methods.\nIn 2014, the Government funded research on the use of e-collars on dogs. The research concluded e-collars can have long-term detrimental effects on the welfare of dogs, and in 2018 the Government announced its intention to ban hand-held remote-controlled electronic collars, encouraging the use of positive reward training methods. Following a public consultation in 2018 seeking views on its plans in England, the Government announced its intention to amend the Animal Welfare Act to implement such a ban.\nInstead, as you know, it announced draft regulations on 27 April 2023 to ban the use of these devices, introducing fines for those in breach of these regulations. This legislation will have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament before it comes into force. If passed, the regulations will come into force on 1 February 2024.\nThis necessary piece of legislation was recently approved by the House of Lords. I welcome the decision to include an exemption for those with protected characteristics to help those who have a legitimate need for collars that emit sound, vibration or other non-shock signals, whether for the benefit of the owner or the animal.\nAlthough the regulations have not yet been given a date for debate in the House of Commons, the Government stated in July 2023 that it remains committed to the ban. I will follow developments on this matter closely.\nI believe all animals, whether they are on a farm, at home as a pet, at large in the wild or in the sea, deserve protection.",

Since then, she’s dealt successfully with over 3000 cases, some of which have had recognition from the National Press and in Select Committee reports.

How I voted.\n- Alex Sobel\n- Jul 19, 2018\n- 2 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nOn Monday the House was presented with the third reading of the Customs Bill. We were all surprised to see the Government accept the amendments put down by the European Research Group (a group of hard line Brexiteer MPs), particularly because the amendments seemed to fly in the face of the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) agreed at chequers.\nNew Clause 36, for example, will prevent the government from collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless there is a reciprocal arrangement. Collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU is an essential component of Mrs May’s customs plan and it is unlikely that the EU will agree to collecting tariffs on behalf of the UK. This, in my opinion makes the FCA a non-starter.\nIt was also surprising to not see the leader of the Liberal Democrats, nor the former leader of the Liberal Democrats in the chamber to vote last night. Mr Farron was instead away from Parliament discussing his ‘controversial views as an evangelical Christian.’* This was particularly disappointing considering that we lost two of the crucial amendments by only three votes. This is not the ‘decent, strong opposition’ that Mr Farron promised when he came to support my predecessor in Leeds North West last year and in 2015.\nPlease see how I voted in each of the amendments below:\nNew Clause 11- This new clause establishes a negotiating objective to secure an agreement which allows the United Kingdom to have tariff free access to the European Union including the potential to participate in a customs union with the European Union, following exit from the European Union,and makes associated provision about reporting and implementation and modification of the Bil as enacted.– Voted For. Result f- 289 a-316\nNew Clause 13 This new clause applies an enhanced parliamentary procedure to several of the provisions in the Bill, requiring that the House of Commons pass an amendable resolution authorising (i) the rate of import duty on particular goods; (ii) the key provisions of regulations that set quotas; (ii) the key provisions of regulations that lower import duties for eligible developing countries; (iii) the quota provisions of regulations to give effect to recommendations of the TRA; (iv) regulations setting additional import duty on agricultural goods; (v) regulations varying import duty as a result of an international dispute, and (vi) the rate of export duty on particular goods.- Voted for.\nResult f- 291 a- 316\nNew Clause 16 This new clause would require Scottish Parliament consent to implement a number of powers in the Bill.– Abstained\nResult f- 36 a- 316\nNew Clause 36 Prohibition on collection of certain taxes or duties on behalf of territory without reciprocity- Voted against\nResult f- 305 a- 302\nAmendment 21- will prevent the Secretary of State for Trade using the public interest test or economic interest test to block the implementation of trade remedies and will ensure that when state sponsored dumping is found that remedial action will be taken to support UK manufactures and producers effected. – Voted for\nResult f- 283 a- 317\nAmendment 73 – stops the UK from joining the EU’s VAT regime.- Voted against\nResult f-303 a-300\nCross Border Taxation Bill (Customs Bill) Third Reading- Voted against\nResult f-318 a-285",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_alex-sobel-transport-strategy-launched/content_441.html": "Alex Sobel Transport Strategy Launched\n- Alex Sobel\n- Aug 29, 2019\n- 2 min read\nAlex Sobel has released his strategic principles for transport in his constituency.\nIn an 8 page document, the MP for Leeds North West outlines his strategic principles for transport which he hopes will kick start a conversation about a fix to the wide ranging problems for everyone on the move in Leeds North West.\nIn it, he describes the role of an MP in furthering change, he said “The purpose of this document is not to engage in a city planning exercise. Nor is it an expert blueprint for a perfect transport system… I am not a traffic engineer, nor am I a highways officer or a local authority decision maker. My role as a Member of Parliament is to evaluate the best outcome for my constituents and advocate on their behalf. It is also my job to identify problems, propose solutions and campaign for change.”\n“And change is needed. Leeds is the largest major city in Europe without a mass transit system. Main roads are at capacity and trust in public transport providers is exceedingly low. We are in the midst of a climate emergency which must be the number one priority at every level of Government. We are a growing city that is attracting investment and new jobs. There is also an increased level of housing development across the city. Without proper investment in infrastructure and a sound strategy to underpin it, our transport network could easily get worse and in some cases fail altogether.”\nHowever, Mr Sobel outlines the importance not just of outlining problems but in providing a space for solutions. He said “For some politicians it is much easier to kill ideas than it is to create or further them. But I am not that kind of politician.”\nThe document, which outlines the “urgent need to address our creaking infrastructure” outlines four strategic principles; promoting public transport, cycling and walking, promoting environmental sustainability, improving the local economy and benefiting public health both physical and mental.\nUnderpinning these principles are commitments to public transport being run in the interest of people and not private profit, easy access to local amenities, green spaces an end to the dominance of the private car.\nThe document will be followed by a series of events in Leeds North West designed to bring forward solutions for transport and spark a ‘grass routes’ approach.",

Working with Alessia Rotta, the Italian appointed Rapporteur, the MP for Leeds North West will lead the engagement of Parliamentarians in meetings in the lead-up to and at the COP26 due to take place this November in Glasgow. The UK and Italy are joint presidents of this year’s conference.\nParliament is currently on recess for conference season. Following Labour Party’s conference last week, Alex travelled by train through to Rome where he has met with Parliamentarians across the globe including Nancy Pelosi, US Speaker of the House of Representatives. Today, he has had an audience with Pope Francis and addressed international speakers of Parliaments in a speech.\nIn his closing remarks in Rome, Alex urged his fellow Parliamentarians to fully engage with the conference described as ‘our last best chance.’ He said, “we need to utilise all the influence in our collective Parliaments not just to reaffirm and set the track for 1.5C but all the effects of a warming planet including disease, habitat and biodiversity loss, climate migration, flooding, wild fires, loss of small island states, falling and failing crop yields and much more which will make our planet uninhabitable.”",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_coronavirus-update-wednesday-13th-may/content_461.html": "Coronavirus update Wednesday 13th May\n- Alex Sobel\n- May 13, 2020\n- 2 min read\nAs many of you know, raising the profile and issues around the care sector has been a major priority for me, ever since this virus took hold. I am devastated to read this morning that over 22,000 care home residents in England and Wales may have died as a direct or indirect result of Covid-19. More than double the official figure. This is a tragedy and my thoughts and prayers go to every family and every staff member who have been deeply affected. I will continue to do all I can for the care homes here in Leeds, but serious questions have to be asked about early Government inaction when all the warning signs were there and could be heard loud and clear by all those who would listen.\nParks\nFrom today:\nCouncil park car parks will reopen but playgrounds in parks will remain closed and the gates locked with notices in place. Outdoor gym equipment in parks is also still off limits and toilet facilities will remain closed.\nMulti use games areas will reopen.\nYou can fish and use bowling greens in parks.\nThe Arium will be open to the public for plant and sundry sales. The café will remain closed.\nFrom 22nd May:\nRoundhay park and Temple Newsam golf courses will open.\nFrom 1st June:\nPark cafes and concessions will be open (takeaway only)\nConcern Around Transport\nThe Government’s guidance telling people to return to work fails to answer a fundamental question. How do you stop the transport network being overwhelmed when it’s currently running at a fraction of capacity? The scenes we saw on packed public transport services yesterday were unsurprising. The Government ordered a return to work with 12 hours’ notice, with no official guidance on how workers can keep safe. That was irresponsible and wrong.\nTravel to the UK\nI’m glad the UK is finally coming into line with other countries and bringing in quarantine measures for those returning home. We need clarity from the Prime Minister, telling us why he is not introducing this immediately. And why have over 100,000 people come into the UK since lockdown without any quarantine measures? The Government needs to work with airlines, air operators and the Border Force to put in place practical solutions to stop the spread of the virus.\nIll-thought through proposals will fail as soon as the Government rolls them out. The Government should have worked out this sort of policy weeks ago. It’s systematic of a government that was too slow. Too slow to enter lockdown, too slow to get vital PPE to the NHS, social care and other key workers, and too slow on testing and tracing to help stop the spread. It will take a long time to recover from the impact of the coronavirus.\nFurlough\nThe Chancellor has announced the extension of furlough until October. The furlough scheme is a lifeline for millions. The Government was right not to pull it away. It is welcome that the Chancellor has heeded the call by Labour, trade unions, and businesses for more flexibility in the scheme.\nThe Government must clarify when they will need employers will to start making contributions, and how much they’ll ask employers to pay. If the Government requires every business to make a large contribution, there is a very real risk that we will see mass redundancies.",

See a detailed breakdown of the votes below.\nAmendment 1 – Customs Union\nPrevents the repeal of the 1972 act bringing the UK into the EU unless the government lays out plans to negotiate a continued customs union after Brexit.\nI voted to support this amendment. I believe that the UK must remain within the EU Customs Union, unless a bespoke customs arrangement is agreed. This will avoid an economic cliff edge as well as ensuring stability on the Irish Border.\nAmendment 3 – environmental protections\nMaintains EU environmental protections in domestic law, with a body to enforce compliance.\nI voted to support this amendment. I believe that we are facing a global environmental crisis that is a threat to our way of life. It is vital that in exiting the EU we do not lose measures that protect our environment.\nAmendment 4 – enhanced scrutiny\nPrevents EU law on areas such as work, health and safety, and environmental standards being modified by secondary legislation without the approval of parliament.\nI voted to support this amendment. We have heard a lot about Parliamentary sovereignty and it is important that Brexit isn’t used as a smokescreen for the Government to remove rights and protections without the scrutiny of Parliament.\nAmendment 5 – charter of fundamental rights\nTransfers the EU’s charter of fundamental rights into domestic law.\nI voted to support this amendment. The bill does not include any provision for workers, environmental and equality rights that weren’t in place prior to adopting the charter of fundamental rights. These are rights for which we have long fought and in voting to leave the EU people did not vote to lose them.\nAmendments 10, 43 and 45 – Henry VIII powers\nLimits the scope of ministers to amend retained EU law under secondary legislation, also known as Henry VIII powers, by changing the wording so it can only happen if “necessary” rather than just if a minister deems it “appropriate”.\nI voted to support this amendment. I am very worried about the government seizing powers instead of giving laws back to Parliament. So much for Parliamentary sovereignty.\nAmendment 19 – meaningful vote\nEnhances the Grieve Amendment that went through the Commons in December guaranteeing a meaningful final vote on the Brexit deal by allowing the Commons to decide the next course of action if parliament rejects the deal.\nI voted to support this amendment. I believe in the sovereignty of Parliament and therefore the right for MPs to reject the deal if the Government come back with an agreement with Brussels that is not good enough and not in the best interests of the country.\nAmendment 20 – parliamentary approval for negotiations\nRequires parliamentary approval for negotiations on phase two before they begin.\nI voted to support this amendment. As stated above I believe in the sovereignty of Parliament and believe that the Government should not be given carte blanche on something as important as managing Brexit, without first meeting the standards set by Parliament.\nAmendment 24 – child refugees\nRequires ministers to seek agreement to maintain the right of unaccompanied child refugees in one EU state to join relatives in the UK after Brexit.\nI voted to support this amendment. This, for me, was straight forward. We must do our humanitarian duty, particularly with regards to child refugees.\nAmendment 25 – Northern Ireland\nRequires no changes to Irish border arrangements without the agreement of both the UK and Irish governments.\nI voted to support this amendment. I was in Northern Ireland when the Good Friday Agreement was signed. I remember how unachievable it seemed and how amazing it was that peace was finally achieved. I cannot accept any negotiating position that plays fast and loose with peace in Northern Ireland.\nAmendment 32 – continued cooperation\nFormalises the idea that EU law can continue in UK law, and the UK can stay in EU agencies.\nI voted to support this amendment. It would be remiss of me not to support the proposer of this amendment, Rt Revd Nick Baines, who is a constituent of mine. I agree with him completely that we must retain EU law after exit day to avoid a legislative black hole.\nAmendment 37, 39 and 125 – no fixed exit date\nThe government had amended the bill to set 29 March 2019 as a definitive exit date. The Lords changed this to make any date subject to parliamentary approval.\nI voted to support this amendment. We must not be held to this arbitrary date, particularly in light of the Government’s lack of progress in their negotiations with Brussels.\nAmendment 51 – the EEA\nObliges the Government to prioritise staying in the European Economic Area.\nI voted to support this amendment. Although this was not a perfect amendment and did not reflect my full position, I believe that if we are unable to secure a bespoke deal which means we have full access to the European Single Market then we must use an existing solution like the EEA. It was a marginal decision for me but on balance I felt it was important to show that all options should remain on the table.\nThis is particularly important considering how little time we have to negotiate a holistic agreement which will take years to negotiate. Frictionless trade requires both a customs union and access to the European Single Market. The only divergence that I have from the Labour front bench position is that and I see the EEA as a lifeboat if only other options close. They too believe that we should have full access to the Single Market but believe that this could be achieved better outside the EEA, our only real difference here is I am concerned that there is not enough time and we need a backstop option.\nAmendment 52 – ability to challenge retained EU law\nRemoves a section of the bill letting ministers use directives to decide who is able to challenge the validity of retained EU law post-Brexit.\nAmendment 52 – ability to challenge retained EU law\nRemoves a section of the bill letting ministers use directives to decide who is able to challenge the validity of retained EU law post-Brexit.\nI voted to support this amendment. It is important that EU law is retained properly within UK law and therefore laws should be open to challenge if they don’t meet the standards set by the EU.\nAmendment 53 – compliance with EU principles\nGuarantees the right of challenge to a domestic law if it fails to comply with the general principles of EU law as set out by the European court of justice.\nI voted to support this amendment. As above – it is important that our retained laws meet EU standards.\nAmendment 110 – the sifting committee\nObliges a committee to scrutinise all ministerial directives used to amend retained EU law.\nI voted to support this amendment. This amendment is about the sovereignty of Parliament. It would be farcical to retain EU laws only to amend them without the appropriate scrutiny by MPs in the House of Commons.\nLabour Front Bench amendment – access to internal market\nstates that a negotiating objective should be “to ensure the United Kingdom has full access to the internal market of the European Union, underpinned by shared institutions and regulations, with no new impediments to trade and common rights, standards and protections as a minimum.”\nI voted to support this amendment. The Leave campaign promised that leaving the EU would not mean leaving the single market. It is important that their promises are kept and that we do not sleepwalk into a hard Brexit.\nNext week new amendments will come back from the Lords. Many Conservative MPs were given reassurances on the Meaningful Vote which were reneged upon by Downing St, I hope we get another chance to get a meaningful vote as its our last chance.\nI also hope that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Henry VIII powers as this bill is the last chance for those. We will get future chances in the Trade and Customs Bill to have amendments on customs and European Single Market and I am already looking forward those bills coming back to the Commons in the next few weeks.",

The Lawnswood Roundabout is the second worst roundabout for collisions in Leeds with cyclists worst affected and all present agreed on this important focus on safety.\nCouncillor Knight and Mr Sobel made a case for keeping tree loss to an absolute minimum with replanting on a 3 to 1 ratio within the locality.\nAll present were very aware of their responsibilities after both the Council and Parliament passed motions on a Climate Emergency and that any changes to the roundabout, should substantially improve air quality and cut carbon.\nAfter the meeting Cllr Lisa Mulherin asked Highways Officers to go away and redraw the plans which will then go back to the public.\nCllr Christine Knight said, ‘after months of hard work with Alex and James Gibson, I am delighted to let you know that the priorities residents have asked for have been recognised by Cllr Lisa Mulherin and the Labour Council Leadership.\nThe scrapping of the old scheme and a new scheme which is all about the safety of my constituents means we can get the best possible result for local residents and better use of public money.’\nAlex Sobel said, ‘air quality and carbon emissions are my biggest priority here in Weetwood, nationally and globally. The original scheme didn’t meet our priorities, so I am delighted to see this fundamental rethink which saves our trees whilst improving the roundabout for cyclists and pedestrians. I have had a huge amount of communication from residents and I am pleased that the Labour team have listened and shown that our actions for residents deliver results whilst others deliver only empty rhetoric.’\nCllr Lisa Mulherin said, “I would like to thank Cllr Christine Knight and Alex Sobel MP for getting in touch with me about Lawnswood Roundabout. Our meeting was very productive and there was a huge amount of common ground. I look forward to working with the councillors and local MP to deliver a scheme which prioritises cycle and pedestrian Safety.’",

The aim was to encourage partnership working to secure an early delivery of the new station, providing jobs at the Airport and improving Leeds North West’s transport network, reducing car traffic on the A660 and improving air quality.\nAlex Sobel has set his sights on an early delivery for the station, currently earmarked for completion in 2023.\nHe said\n“We must have a proper strategic plan for transport in Leeds. Since I took office I have been working to ensure that we see improvements to local rail and bus services. This new station will not only attract investment to the Airport, creating local jobs, but will provide a viable heavy rail alternative with a park and ride, to commuters in North Leeds and Wharfedale. The new service will cut journey times to Leeds to 12 minutes.”\n“I have committed to doing all that I can, to work with every agency to get the earliest possible delivery of the new station and to ensure that it is stocked with high quality trains that meet the inevitable demand.”\n“A London connection to the new station is a gamechanger for our area creating jobs and growth in our local community.”\nLNER’s commercial manager Paul Smith said:\nIt was a great pleasure to attend the meeting and I thank Mr Sobel for organising it. We are very excited to be involved. Our aim at LNER is to continue to support the local community and economy through greater partnership working and making it even easier to travel by train.\"\nCharles Johnson, Head of Planning and Development at Leeds Bradford Airport said:\n“We are pleased that our MP has injected some momentum into these discussions. It is so important that we get the necessary infrastructure up and running to realise our potential as an Airport and to enable us to provide jobs and growth to the local and regional economy.”",

Alex, who has himself responded to the consultation, raised deep concerns about the complexity and volume of the documentation and the lack of time for people to adequately respond to it.\nIn response, Leeds City Council have now extended the end of formal consultation until 7th July. This will give a total of over 9 weeks for submission of comments since the application was validated.\nLike all local authorities, Leeds City Council has a legal obligation to consider planning applications put before it. To date there have been over 2000 comments on the application.\nAlex Sobel said, “I welcome the decision to postpone the deadline and to allow time for more people to assess and comment on the plans before a decision is made by Leeds City Council. The documentation is vast and complex, and it is important for people to be able to hear and access the arguments that are made in favour or against this application. I would hope that this extension comes hand in hand with accessible events for the community to gain an understanding of what is being proposed\nI have submitted my objection on the basis that, whilst I have no objection with the modernisation of the building and there are many things within that to support, I simply cannot back a plan that is dependent on an increase in passenger numbers and therefore flight emissions at a time where we should be focusing on and committed to meeting our climate obligations and the industry should be focusing on recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.”",

I would like to thank Headteacher Mark Duce and his team for their incredible work and resilience during this time.\nI would also like to make mention of Cllr Eleanor Thompson who has been relentless in her lobbying of the council executive, taking responsibility and making the case for families within the school community.\nThis announcement is good news and will be of great relief to many. But we must now engage in the process of trying to find alternative ways to solve the very real issues of reduced number of pupils in the area coming through, and the continued financial pressure on all our schools.”\nIn a letter to the school and to Alex Sobel MP, Executive member for Education Jonathan Pryor said, “Tomorrow I will be withdrawing the paper on Queensway from Executive Board.\nThis would mean that the Council would not be publishing a proposal to close Queensway Primary School, as previously proposed. While issues around the falling birth rate in the Aireborough area are unchanged, the consultation to address this through a closure of Queensway garnered the highest level of responses we have ever received and were overwhelmingly in favour of keeping Queensway open.\nAs was said throughout, a final decision was never pre-determined, and while a consultation is not a referendum, after reading all contributions to the consultation, it was only right to listen to that strength of feeling.”",

One parents stated their child had not received a voucher for over 3 weeks!\nThe Government allocated the contract for the free school meal vouchers to French company Edenred to ensure that families with children who are classed as vulnerable and entitled to free school meals, receive a £15 voucher each week to exchange in a supermarket to ensure they receive a lunchtime meal.\nI recently checked in with all schools within my constituency to make sure everything was OK and to ask if they have an issues with the scheme. The responses I received were shocking, with only one small school saying they were using the scheme with no issues.\nMany schools are reporting that they are no longer using the scheme and have resorted to issuing food hampers. One school said “we are just hoping the Government will reimburse the cost”.\nSchools have had issues accessing the website or suffering from the system crashing whilst trying to place their order. Some parents have then either not received the vouchers whilst others with only access to the internet via smartphones have struggled to access the vouchers. Some parents have even had their vouchers refused at the supermarket checkout as they appear invalid when scanned.\nOne School Admin Administrator told me “I just want to ensure my families get their vouchers”, another said “It’s clear Edenred are unable to cope with the high demand, this does not help parents provide food for their children”.\nJo Bell, Headteacher at Lawnswood School told me “I was unable to upload bulk orders (the vouchers) to be sent directly to parents so have had to do all the administrative task of sending out individual codes myself.”\nDavid Cooke, Headteacher, Rufford Park Primary School in Yeadon shared with me his experience of the website crashing and vouchers not being received. He also explained that because there is a £200 limit for each supermarket, some vouchers are issued for supermarkets not near where his pupils live. This is a big problem for many families who are stuck at home without access to transport. He has had no reply at all from Eden Red customer support to either phone calls or emails.\nIt is deeply disturbing to think that a scheme which has been implemented by the Government to help some of our most vulnerable children has managed to fail so badly.There has been an MP hotline set up by Edenred. Whilst we are grateful for it and continue to use it, it does show that these problems are not unique to my constituency.",

The headline is 80% of their profits. For those of us who have been banging the drum for self-employed workers, it is pleasing that the Government have now recognised the need to step in. But the devil here is in the detail. There are many caveats to this and not everyone will see this as a huge relief. It is important to note that ‘profit’ does not necessarily accurately reflect income as much of their turnover will be offset. For example, their mileage will be taken from profit, as will their repairs, tools, insurance, business premises bills (or home bills if working from home). This means that for many ‘profits’ are often lower than what they actually need to live on.

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_alex-sobel-backs-labour-s-commitment-to-indefinite-tenancies-for-private-renters/content_495.html": "Alex Sobel backs Labour’s commitment to indefinite tenancies for private renters\n- Alex Sobel\n- Mar 11, 2020\n- 2 min read\nAlex Sobel has backed Labour’s pledge to protect private renters in England from eviction with new ‘indefinite’ tenancies, based on rules currently in place in Germany.\nThe change would revolutionise the private rental market, potentially benefitting over 400,000 households in West Yorkshire, 80,000 of which are in Leeds. German tenancies last, on average, 11 years, compared to around 4 years in England.\nIn England, according to a survey of landlords conducted by the Government, landlords or their agents make the decision to end almost one in five tenancies (18%). At present, tenants can be evicted without any reason being given, and despite having done nothing wrong. Nationally, one in three private renters – 1.6m households – have dependent children.\nUnder the German system, tenancies are effectively open-ended with a tenant only able to be evicted on tightly defined grounds, for example if they don’t pay the rent or commit criminal behaviour in the property.\nAt the 2017 election, Labour committed to default three year tenancies. Labour will now consult widely with landlord and tenant groups on the proper grounds for termination of a tenancy, ahead of the next general election. The Party has previously set out additional measures for controls on rents and tougher standards which will sit alongside this new proposal.\nAlex Sobel said: “Constituents in my advice surgeries regularly tell me about the difficulties of uncertain rental agreements. Not only does this causes huge anxiety amongst tenants about losing their homes, but also has the knock on effect of families suffering poorer conditions as damage to the property is less likely to be reported to landlords.”\n“It’s about time we got a grip of housing in this country. Reform of the private rented sector is far overdue.”\nJohn Healey MP, Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary, said:\n“Private renters shouldn’t be living in fear of losing their homes.\n“The insecurity of renting is a power imbalance at the heart of our broken housing market, where tenants are afraid to report problems in case they are evicted, and families with children are forced to move at short notice.\n“Many landlords provide decent homes that tenants are happy with, but the Government is allowing rogue landlords to take advantage of good tenants. Renters deserve better.”\nEnds\nNotes to editors\nThere are currently more than 4.5m households – around 11m people – who rent their home from a private landlord in England. This number is double the number of just 14 years ago. Of these households, one in three have dependent children: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2017-to-2018-headline-report\nLabour’s previous support for three year tenancies, as set out at the last general election, is detailed here: https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Housing-Mini-Manifesto.pdf.\nMore information on security of tenure in Germany is available in this report from the Institute for Public Policy Research: https://www.ippr.org/files/publications/pdf/lessons-from-germany-jan17.pdf. It reports that the average tenancy length in the German private rented sector is 11 years.\nAccording the English Private Landlord Survey 2018, 18% of instances where a tenancy had been terminated in the last two years was the result of a decision of the landlord or their agent: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-private-landlord-survey-2018-main-report.\nThe English Housing Survey reports that the average reported tenancy length of a private rented tenant is around 4 years: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/774820/2017-18_EHS_Headline_Report.pdf",

Many of them also spoke about the unrelenting hope they hold for others still waiting to be reunited with their family members.\nThese families stand as a reminder of the human cost behind these issues, and I asked the Prime Minister to consider this deeply personal perspective in any future decisions.\nCompassion, empathy, and an unwavering commitment to peace must guide our actions moving forward.",

We need FirstGroup first to agree to sell the West Yorkshire division separately and to give WYCA the First option to buy.\nOur focus then will be to make sure WYCA gets the funding that it needs and there are several potential avenues for this. The standard of our Bus service is not of the quality that it needs to be to ensure reliability for our constituents and to encourage wide scale usage. If we are successful in this campaign, we can finally provide our constituents with oversight of their service, putting the people in the driving seat.”\nJudith Blake leader of Leeds City Council said, “I am pleased that the West Yorkshire MPs share our desire to explore ownership of our bus service and hope that First Group seriously consider these calls. This presents us with an opportunity to engage in the process of the sale of First Bus. We are still at an early stage but thank the MPs for opening up a potential dialogue with FirstGroup.”\nAlex Sobel has also today tabled an Early Day Motion in Parliament echoing these calls.\nThis comes after a meeting at WYCA where council leaders discussed the possibility of a purchase being made.",

Alex was joined at the event by all the Leeds Labour MPs including Hilary Benn, Rachel Reeves, Richard Burgon and Fabian Hamilton. Also in attendance was Mayor Tracy Brabin and Barry Gardiner MP.\nIn a speech at the event Alex said \"there are businesses, well known businesses, that when push came to shove made the wrong choice. Instead of supporting staff onto furlough, instead of making sure that their dedicated employees had a job to come back to, they took the easy option. They chose to lay off their staff.\nNow imagine this for a second. You have given your Labour, your time and energy, to an organisation for years. A global pandemic hits and throws the UK into both a health crisis and an economic crisis. You are worried about your family. Is my mum going to be OK on her own? Am I going to catch Covid and be hospitalised? Is that pre-existing condition going to make me vulnerable?\nThe last thing that you expect, is for your employer to leave you out of work and onto Universal Credit. Can you just imagine the anxiety, the fear and the economic harm that this would cause you? Speaking to these constituents was heart breaking. I begged this establishment to reconsider. Their Trade Union begged the establishment to reconsider.But they said no – we are struggling financially, and we are acting within the law.\"",

As a member of the Environmental Audit Committee, I have consistently held the government accountable for decisions that impact on our climate.\nWithin my constituency, I have pushed for greater flood prevention resources, more protection for our green spaces, secured £29 million in clean air funding and produced a transport strategy for Leeds North West. I am a passionate anti climate change campaigner, I have been to the arctic to see first-hand the melting of the polar ice caps and earlier this year I won a ‘Green Heart Hero’ award for MP Climate Champion.\nI am thrilled that the Labour Party has launched a consultation on an ambitious green economic recovery for post covid-19. I encourage everybody to take part and submit your ideas to build an environmentally sustained economy.\nThe consultation will run from the end of June and you can take part here:\nTest and Trace\nBoris Johnson was clear at Prime Ministers Questions that we were to expect a ‘world class’ track and trace system by the 1st of June. That has not happened. Council leaders believe that the local element is ‘weeks away from being ready.’ Baroness Dido Harding, who is heading up the NHS test and trace system has said it will not be fully operational until the end of June. The full system will not be up and running until September. Germany had its test and trace system in place by April 17th.\nOn a local level, Leeds is putting our system in place including test and trace forward. Leeds feel that their public health teams have good infrastructures to deal with outbreaks and are not starting from scratch.\nComplex settings such as schools, prisons and care homes to establish outbreaks early. They are working with communities that maybe don’t have a positive level of trust in institutions to ensure people are getting tested within their communities.\nWe also need the Government to ensure there is a more localised ‘R’ number rather than lumping Yorkshire in with the north east.\nLeeds have seven key themes within a broad plan for the city including test, trace, communities at higher risk, data and intelligence.\nIndividual behaviour is still the best defence against the virus and we need to all engage with this local approach. That way we can start to safely live with the virus.\nLeeds’ seven-point plan for the city:\nPlanning for local outbreaks in care homes and schools.\nIdentifying and planning how to manage other high-risk places, locations and communities of interest.\nIdentifying methods for local testing to ensure a swift response that is accessible to the entire population.\nAssessing local and regional contact tracing and infection control capability in complex settings, and the need for mutual aid.\nIntegrating national and local data and scenario planning from the new Joint Biosecurity Centre.\nSupporting vulnerable people to get help to self-isolate and ensuring services meet the needs of diverse communities.\nEstablishing governance structures led by existing COVID-19 Health Protection Boards in conjunction with local NHS, supported by existing Gold command forums and a new member-led Board to communicate with the public.\nFurther Resources and Guidance: · An overview of how Test and Trace works · Guidance for employers and workers · Guidance for people told by NHS contact tracers that they need to self-isolate · Updated guidance for households with a possible or confirmed coronavirus case. · Flow chart (first slide) showing the key steps for people displaying symptoms/ who have been contacted by Test & Trace. · NHS advice for people contacted by T&T following a positive coronavirus test. · NHS advice for people contacted by T&T after being in contact with someone who has coronavirus.\nGovernment statistics\nThe UK’s statistics watchdog has criticised the government over its handling of coronavirus data. Following the Cummings scandal it’s vital that ministers rebuild trust if the public are to adhere to social distancing.\nThis intervention from the UK statistics authority is damning.\nFor test and trace to be effective we all need confidence in the data. The Health Secretary must start publishing the numbers of people tested and the number of contacts traced. He must stop including mailed tests as completed and offer a full update on how many care home residents, care staff and NHS staff the Government tested whether symptomatic or not.\nFamilies to Stay Healthy and Happy\nThe Public Health team at Leeds City Council has been working with Active Leeds to develop a resource to share with families. Resources includes an activity pack with great ideas for fun things to do at home. Alongside information leaflet which contains useful links, tips and phone numbers. The leaflet is now available for downloading.\nActive Leeds has designed a resource pack to encourage children, young people and families to be more active. Under 8’s toolkit is called Ready Set Rainbow and The over 8’s Active Leeds toolkit is called Get Active Stay Active.\nNeighbourhood Networks\nI would like to highlight the work of the Neighbourhood Networks, they have done a great job to help older people in Leeds during coronavirus. Through telephone befriending, delivering food and meals and fighting off boredom.\nMany of the networks are helping older people get online as part of 100% Digital Leeds, now more important than ever.\nLeeds Care Home\n20 care homes currently have Covid-19 outbreaks. The trend is improving thanks to the intensive work of homes, and our social care and health protection colleagues. Authorities have identified 75 care homes for whole home testing. It can take between 2 and 14 days to receive test kits and then similar time to get results.\nPPE remains a challenge, with shortages of gloves and masks, but homes are being resourceful to source mutual aid or new suppliers.\nEconomic Response to COVID\nThe Government has shut down the economy in an unprecedented way, it is urgent that the government acts to protect jobs and incomes. It is now becoming clear that problems with the design and performance of many of the existing programmes are reducing their take-up.\nThe efficacy of these programmes will be essential to the impact of the crisis on jobs and incomes. Labour has designed three tests for the economic response to coronavirus:\nKeeping people in work.\nGetting cash to struggling businesses.\nPreventing more poverty through changes to social security.\nThe Government needs to increase International coordination. The Treasury needs to lead on extensive coordination with the IMF, G20 and EU policymakers.\nProtecting Jobs\nI am delighted that Labour are calling on the government to act to protect jobs and incomes by:\nPreventing companies from making more people redundant. By acting on those employers who continue to refuse to furlough affected workers.\nFixing blockages in the business loan schemes so businesses can access the support they need.\nClarifying the situation for those currently excluded from the Government’s self-employment scheme.\nTurning Universal Credit advances into grants and considering extra changes to improve UC.\nMaking all workers, including low-paid workers, eligible for Statutory Sick Pay.\nIncreasing the level of Statutory Sick Pay.\nSpearheading international coordination to prevent financial system-wide spillovers caused by the crisis.\nMake public the proposed exit strategy to ensure economic measures remain appropriate.\nBin Collections\nLeeds City Council have asked for us to all bear with them as collecting all the bins is proving a greater challenge than ever.

I know that this news will be very welcome to children and parents in Pool.\nHowever, I still hold deep reservations about this Multi Academy Trust due to the overall effect it has on schools in Leeds. Leeds schools are proven to be more successful as maintained schools with local accountability and must work together for the benefit of all Leeds children.”",

The money raised will fund educational reform in state schools.\nWe will boost arts and digital funding and offer better careers guidance to children – making work experience compulsory and teaching students about pensions, mortgages and contracts.\nWe will double the current funding for dementia and seek to build a national care service in the image of the NHS.\nWe will set up a state-run pro bono service t compel firms to offer a certain amount of free legal advice to those who need it and are not eligible for legal aid.\nWe will speed up rape and sexual assault cases and toughen up on street harassment and misogyny.\nWe will restore neighbourhood policing through new police hubs and fight of anti-social behaviour.\nWe will spend £35m to fund to help British veterans and Afghan interpreters – to provide mental health support services and support.\nWe will place extra controls on the use of British troops and police to train their counterparts abroad to ensure the UK is not offering support to countries abusing human rights.\nWe will boost devolution to give local councils greater control over the investment and infrastructure their areas.",

Both Israelis and Palestinians have been failed.\nLayla Moran is the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for foreign affairs and international development.\nAlex Sobel is the Labour MP for Leeds North West\nMuch has been said in the past three weeks about the tragedy of Israelis and Palestinians, not least in the Houses of Parliament. For us, it is deeply personal. We are the only two British MPs with parents who grew up in Israel and Palestine. Though we represent different political parties, this is not the first time we’ve worked together on this conflict. However, we feel this is the most urgent, and most important, intervention we have had to make. Israelis and Palestinians need support from their friends abroad, and our own communities here in the UK that are affected by the conflict need reassurance as the Middle East conflict spreads to the streets of the UK.\nWe are concerned by how little space there is for nuance in parliament and in wider society on this issue. We feel compelled to lead by example, and to build consensus around clear calls to action in the short term, as well as longer-term plans – which we think can be supported across the spectrum. We know, from images and personal accounts, the horrors that Israelis and Palestinians have faced this month. Israelis are traumatised from the unimaginable crimes that Hamas terrorists committed when they entered Israeli towns, torturing and massacring men, women and children, murdering more than 1,400 people, and taking more than 220 people hostage. Israel’s military response has resulted in the displacement of more than a million Palestinians from northern Gaza and the death of more than 6,000 people in aerial bombardments. The situation on the ground is dire, and adequate aid isn’t being allowed into Gaza.\nWe put these narratives side by side not to compare, or excuse, but so people understand the raw pain that both Israelis and Palestinians are experiencing, rather than choosing one side and ignoring the other. One dead child killed in war is one too many. Showing sympathy for what Israelis have experienced does not equal supporting Israel’s government, and standing in solidarity with Palestinians does not signal support of Hamas. It must be possible to show empathy with both peoples, so that we can find a way through this darkness.\nRight now, we must work to minimise further civilian casualties – the numbers of which are already too high. International pressure is needed to ensure that other regional actors are not drawn into the war. Calls for a humanitarian pause in fighting must be enacted – on both sides – to allow proper aid into Gaza to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding, as well as facilitate the release of the hostages. While eyes are all turned to Gaza, we cannot ignore the West Bank where settler violence, demolitions and evictions, which were already at an all-time high, now risk spiralling out of control.\nIt is both the responsibility of Israel and the international community to prevent a humanitarian disaster. Palestinians in Gaza – more than half of whom are children – must have access to clean water, fuel, medical supplies, electricity and food. It is not reasonable or moral to prevent children from accessing basic survival needs. All Israeli hostages in Gaza must be released immediately, unharmed. We have been touched by the pleas of families we have met, who are living a nightmare as they beg for their loved ones to be returned home. This is an urgent priority.\nDoctors in Gaza use phone torches as hospitals run out of fuel for generators – video report In order to maintain the international community’s commitment to a future Palestinian state, there must be a cast-iron guarantee from the Israeli government that Palestinians who were forced to evacuate northern Gaza will be allowed to return when the war is over. Permanent displacement isn’t an option. Furthermore, the international community will need to work, yet again, to reconstruct Gaza, much of which has been turned to dust.\nIsrael has the right to defend its citizens from the very real threat of Hamas. We are not naive to the challenges of fighting a terror organisation embedded in a densely populated civilian area that pays no regard to the rules of war. However, international law has to guide us and ensure restraint so that damage to infrastructure in Gaza is minimised to prevent further loss of life. The calls we make aren’t “choosing a side”. Israelis and Palestinians have been failed by the international community. How many rounds of violence must they live through? How many times has the human rights community and peace camp warned us things will get worse? How many condemnations and statements have been issued by governments worldwide?\nThis has been a terrible lesson – but it must be a lesson. When this war is over, and casualties are counted, the only choice for the international community is to not only call for, but urgently work for a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The terrible status quo that has left millions of Palestinians stateless, living without their basic rights under Israeli occupation, and Israel without secure borders, must end. That will require us to harness the energies of the US, the EU, UK and the Arab world. We cannot raise our hands in despair and give up when things get hard. We have to put every ounce of energy into making it happen.\nWe must promise that, out of this nightmare, we will build a future for Israelis and Palestinians so everyone can live in peace, dignity and security. There must be two states for two peoples. It may look impossible right now, but there is no other choice.\nLayla Moran is the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for foreign affairs and international development.\nAlex Sobel is the Labour MP for Leeds North West",

We also saw waiting times recently at Leeds General Infirmary A&E department of 8 hours plus, with people queuing outside with a 2 hour wait to get booked in and inside.”\nHe went on to say “We know that the NHS services have severe under-funding problems as well as staffing shortages, many people are already waiting over a year for routine operations and outpatient appointments”\nHe pointed out “I have huge respect for everyone employed in our NHS, they have been the ones truly on the front line during the pandemic and remain so. Unfortunately, after 10 years of cuts from the Government, the effects on staff levels due to Brexit and the understandable choice of many within the service to retire or leave following the worse times during last year, we now face vast shortages of staff and funding putting our most precious service under a strain it has never seen before”\nMr Sobel went on to say “The Government lifted the requirements in England to wear face masks earlier this year in shops and public enclosed places. We have seen the return of mass crowds to football matches and concert arenas. Whilst I am pleased to see fans returning, I am sceptical around there being no requirements to social distance or wear masks.”\nIn comparison we are now seeing the difference between the effects of this action and other Countries such as France who have not relaxed their rules on face masks and have much lower covid rates.\nEngland now has the highest daily rates of Covid in Europe, with the latest figure being 49,156, with the R Rate now at 0.9-1.1.\nAlex explained “Add on top of this the usual winter illnesses, such as flu combined with rising hospitalisation of covid cases, a huge backlog on NHS Services and staffing shortages and we will see another Winter of crisis”\nHe said “Whilst people are free to make their own choices regarding vaccines and face masks I am not always sure that the correct information regarding the current covid situation is being communicated properly to the public.\nThe rise in Covid cases puts our NHS under so much pressure and whilst people themselves may not have covid they may need the NHS for other reasons and find delays in their treatment or gaining access to the services”\n“I think it’s important that the bigger picture, the knock-on effect if you like is understood by everyone and if we want a health service that is free on entry for all we must protect it by taking sensible precautions and the Government must provide the full necessary funding required”",

WYCA agreed that they would continue the subsidy until April.\nOne of the main concerns of parents was the additional costs that would be incurred if students attended after-school activities.\nFollowing discussions, it has been confirmed that tickets issued by either operator will be available for use on these services.\nThe exact requirements will be negotiated after discussions with Prince Henrys Grammer School.\nAlex Sobel said “It is a real shame that the combined authority is unable to continue funding school bus services due to deep Government cuts to our transport services over the last decade. This is yet another burden on parents who are finding their income and living standards squeezed.\nThat said, I am pleased that the authority has done what it can to mitigate the sudden impact of these changes and todays news ensures that children taking part in after school activities will not be unduly penalised. I will continue to be the voice of parents in my negotiations with all transport providers and authorities as well as a champion for transport funding in Parliament.”",

This, ‘simplification’ and ‘cutting of red tape’ only in practice meant that developers could ride roughshod over planning law, sit on land banks of millions and put the onus on local Government to prove why a site is unsuitable as opposed to the developer.\nHave we really seen an improvement in the planning system over the past decade and has this ‘cutting of red tape’ really seen a surge in affordable housing? Whilst there are some things in this white paper to like (the abolishment of viability assessments for example), there are some key concerns I have.\nFirstly, there is a democracy gap. There is a move to remove significant engagement with specific applications in favour of ‘democratising’ local neighbourhood plans. That is all very well, but Otley’s recent neighbourhood plan referendum had a turnout of 23.6% – and that is high for such a poll. How will the Government increase engagement in such an exercise and how will this adequately reflect the concern of a community around specific applications?\nFast tracking individuals to build stories onto their homes without giving affected neighbours a say is wrong.\nSecondly, it is still unclear what the effect will be on communities labelled ‘growth’ and on whether this will disproportionately affect poorer more urban areas. Whilst there is talk of an increased Community Infrastructure Levy (to replace section 106), there are still concerns over exceptions and whether developers will still manage to escape their commitments to green spaces, and local infrastructure.\nThis is without mentioning the commitment to social housing that Labour councils have tried to increase in local plans. Do we have faith that Robert Jenrick, the same man who assisted Richard Desmond in avoiding millions in CIL can be trusted to create legislation that would ensure developers pay their fair share to the community?\nEvidence gathered by the CPRE shows that “three-quarters of housing developments should not have been granted planning permission due to poor or mediocre design quality” Will further deregulation of the process not further this problem? Encouraging renovations in unused buildings is a good thing, but renovations carry VAT where newbuilds do not. This onlu encourages developers to bulldoze old buildings in favour of new ones. Nobody could argue that making planning simpler is a bad thing. But we have heard this before. Giving people access to the planning process and making the system more rules based and understandable should not mean that developers get an easy ride through the planning system. Allowing developers easy planning permission does not result in a boom of affordable or social housing.\nWe must keep planning local. I am confident that Leeds’ Site Allocations Plan is strong enough to withstand these new rules, but it is easy to see how a Tory Government can strip down the tools of local Government to protect it’s communities against unwanted and undesirable development. It is an old Tory trick that strips councils of their ability to adequately guard against bad development safe in the knowledge that it will ultimately be the council who take the blame for those developments.\nI look forward to seeing how this white paper develops into legislation and we will be scrutinising that legislation.",

Many claimants will see a loss of earnings of up to £1000 a year”\n“This will impact the lowest paid hardest and hurt our economic recovery. Added to the burden of soaring energy costs, increases to National Insurance payments, cost of food increases etc, the result will be more people/families living in poverty.”\nIn Leeds there are already 1 in 5 children living in poverty with the number predicted to rise following these cuts.\nMr Sobel pointed out “It is scandalous to think that a nation as rich as ours even has children living in poverty”\nAlex also added “Is this really how the Government want to thank so many of the people who kept this country going through the pandemic, the nurses, the shop workers, the bus/train drivers and many more?”\nAlex has long campaigned for the benefits system to be overhauled and Universal Credit to be replaced by a new social security system which provides a proper social security safety net and has dignity and respect at its heart.\nHe has also campaigned during the pandemic for all six legacy benefits to be raised by £20 a week in line with the Universal credit rise.\nAlex further added “Everybody is entitled to have their basic needs met, and nobody should have to decide whether to eat or be warm this winter”\n“The knock-on effect of this cut will lead to children not being able to concentrate at school due to hunger, increase demand in our mental health services by people unable to financial cope (a service that has already been cut to the core by tory cuts), more demand on foodbanks, baby banks and clothes banks. Many claimants may also be pushed into rent arrears”\nAlex ended by saying “The Government have until Thursday to do the right thing and U-turn on this decision and keep families afloat this winter”\nLabour and many back bench Conservatives are both putting pressure on the Chancellor Rishi Sunak to reverse his decision to scrap the £20 uplift.",

He has called on the Government to mark the occasion by ensuring that those living in service family accommodation are provided with secure homes for the future.\n“It has been a hundred years since Lloyd George demanded ‘a land fit for heroes’ “, said Mr Sobel. “This 100 year anniversary of the end of the first world war is a chance to reflect, not just on those who we have lost over the past century, but on the way that service personnel and their families are provided for in modern Britain. Service families live transient lives, moving from place to place. This is why it is so important that there are enough decent homes for them to live in.”\nIn 1996, John Major’s Government sold off 57,400 service family homes to Annington Homes, a private provider run by a Japanese Bank. The Ministry of Defence received 1.67bn upfront for the homes, which were then leased back to them. Whilst this provided an immediate cash injection to the MoD, the long-term picture has not been so positive.\nA recently published National Audit Office report found that the increase in house prices means the Government sell off in the 1990s has resulted in around £2–£4 billion in lost revenue, while the MoD are also paying rent for thousands of empty homes. Annington Homes have since sold off 20,000 houses and are looking to earn more money from the homes by renting to civilians in the private sector.\nMost worryingly, the contract agreed with Annington Homes in 1996 allowed for a ‘rent review’ in 2021. Now many armed forces families are fearful about a sudden and steep increase in the cost of their housing. New service families are already paying 2020 prices. The 2% increase in soldier’s pay this year, the first in 8 years, may be swallowed up by this increase.\nMr Sobel has supported service families on this housing problem since he was elected last year. He has asked 13 written Parliamentary questions on the subject, and in an oral question asked the defence minister Tobias Ellwood, ‘Does the Minister think that the sale to Annington Homes in 1996 was a mistake?’. The minister’s answer did not directly address the question.\nAlex Sobel said, “Many service families are very worried about their housing but fear speaking out. I have a responsibility to give them a voice and I am calling on the Ministry of Defence to hear their voices and act to ensure a standard of decent, affordable homes that serving armed forces families deserve.\nThe way that military homes have been used to provide profit for the private sector is a scandal, one that is falling hardest on those who risk their lives in service to their country. The centenary commemorations encourage us to consider the role of our armed forces: providing adequate housing for currently serving forces families should be a national priority.”",

More details to follow.\nWhat you need to know regarding Leeds entering ‘Tier 3’ restrictions on Monday.\nWhy are new restrictions being introduced?\nOn Monday the 2nd November, Leeds along with the whole of West Yorkshire is being placed by the Government in to ‘Tier 3’ Very High restrictions.\nThis is due to infections rates rising in our area, as of Fri 30th October, the seven day average infection rate in Leeds is 416 per 100,000, on the 9th September, just over 6 weeks ago, the 7 day rolling average rate for Leeds was 73.6.\nThis is now impacting on our city’s hospitals with intensive care units becoming over stretched and elected surgeries and treatments are starting to be cancelled.\nThe aim of the new restrictions are to reduce the infection rates and to protect the NHS as we go into what is already annually its busiest period.\nWhilst I appreciate how restrictive the rules and guidance are, it is imperative that we get the infection rate down to a manageable level. We can all help do this by following the rules and remembering to wash our hands, social distance and wear face masks where mandatory.\nWhat are the new restrictions?\nAll the restrictions we are currently under plus the additional restrictions below.\nPubs and bars closed unless serving alcohol with a substantial meal. All venues that remain open are still subject to the 10 pm curfew\nHouseholds (other than in bubbles) cannot mix indoors or outdoors, other than in parks and other public outdoor spaces such as beaches (and then must be within rule of 6)\nShops, schools and universities will remain open\nWedding ceremonies with up to 15 people are permitted but receptions are not. Funerals are permitted up to 30 people\nGuidance also advises against travel into or outside of the area except for certain purposes such as education, work and caring responsibilities\nAdditional Restrictions for West Yorkshire\nThe closure of:\nCasinos\nSoft Play Areas\nAdult Gaming Centres\nBetting Shops\nCar boot sales.\nThe following restricted opening measures will also be put in place:\nShisha bars must not serve Shisha – but may operate as cafés\ngyms may open, but guidance is against indoor exercise classes taking place.\nYou should continue to:\nfollow social distancing rules\nwork from home where you can effectively do so\nwalk or cycle where possible, or plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport\nThe restrictions will be reviewed in 28 days from commencement.\nIs any financial support being offered to West Yorkshire?\nWest Yorkshire will receive £59.3m of support.\nThis funding is made up of:\nA one-off additional amount of £20 per head: for West Yorkshire this is estimated to be worth £46.6m in additional funding to support businesses.\nA total of £8 per head to support enhanced test and trace and contain measures, resulting in an additional £12.7m.\nThis is in addition to the existing business grant arrangements previously announced by the Chancellor.\nWhat you can expect from me.\nMy Office will be available to contact and my staff will be operating from home. As such our phones will be re-routed and answered by staff at their homes. We are expecting a large increase in cases again as these measures are introduced and as a new ovid spike occurs so please can you contact the office via email wherever you can (alex@alexsobel.co.uk) and keep your queries short and specific. Please also include your address and whether or not you would like to receive a reply.\nI am conducting constituency surgeries for specific individual casework and I am doing these online and over the telephone. For more general policy enquiries, I do ‘Ask Alex’ every other Saturday at 2pm on Facebook Live.",

Upon coming into power, Labour found that the funding for the programme was shockingly due to run out in March 2025.\nSuccessive Conservative Prime Ministers came to Leeds and promised our new Hospital site at LGI knowing they hadn’t committed the funding for it and this is the unforgivable legacy left by the Tories. Time and again they led us up the garden path, raising expectations that we could expect a new hospital overnight when the money simply wasn’t there.\nWe all know how important the new adult and Children's Hospital and the desperately needed Maternity unit is for our City and that's why local residents, staff and patients expect an honest, realistic and deliverable timetable. I’m relieved that is what the Labour Government has given us today.\nI will continue to campaign for the LGI and work with Government on the extensive maintenance backlog at every opportunity, the Health Secretary has already offered to meet me with the Hospital Trust and I will keep local residents updated on the progress of the programme every step of the way.\nWhile the delay is undoubtedly disappointing, the most important thing is that we will get this much-needed hospital. However, the pressing concern remains the significant backlog of maintenance. I am eager for the Secretary of State to meet with myself and the hospital to review the urgent works required to keep it operational until the new facility is completed in the 2030s.\nYou can read more on this here.",

Mr Sobel said “In my constituency of Leeds North West there is, as far as I am aware, only one charging point available for electric vehicles, which is slow and has limited access. Yet there are at least 21 charge points in the city centre.”\n“I have written to Otley’s Business Improvement District (BID) and Leeds City Council about improving our infrastructure by installing electric vehicle (EV) charging points in council car parks. A good network of EV charge points is vital as we seek to improve the quality of air in our local area, especially on the A660, and in Otley and the Wharfe Valley where pollution lingers.\nThe future is electric and we must prepare for it.”",

There are difficulties with resources, and they are still trying to access guidance from the Government. I am pleased to report that they have been out and about in our communities and doing their best to enforce social distancing.\nI am also hearing several reports of workplaces who are still asking staff to come into the office even when unnecessary. The guidance from the Government is unclear but I would urge all employers to use common sense and adhere to the core principles behind social distancing.\nI have been working with Hilary Benn MP to ensure that the large telecoms companies such as Capita are not asking staff to come into the office. As well as being in touch directly, we have met with Leeds City Council and West Yorkshire police to look at enforcement methods. I also lead a letter to the Prime Minister with 15 other MPs to urge the Government to be clearer in their guidance and definitions of who is and who is not a ‘key worker.’\nFoodbanks\nLeeds North & West foodbank have closed Bramley but all other sites are open. We are working with them to find new sites and match volunteers to ensure that the service is there for people at the time of greatest need.\nInfant Feeding\nWe have received a useful advice sheet from Unicef that provides some clear guidance for families concerned about feeding their infant. Please see UNICEF Factsheet.\nScams\nIt appears that a number of scam emails are circulating stating: “if your child’s school is closed and your child is entitled to free school meals; then to send your bank details to the school and they will help you with funding while schools are closed.” The links are fake and vulnerable families may be giving their bank details online. Please be careful and don’t share bank details with anyone.\nOffice of Alex Sobel MP\nOur office is available for those who need us. Please bear in mind that we are receiving a very high volume of calls and enquiries at the moment and we are prioritising our service according to the greatest need.\nRemember… Stay safe and stick to official advice and information.",

The core of COP is the climate negotiations which happens on two levels – technical and political. But there is so much around it. Two zones with stands, pavilions and events.\nA Blue Zone, which is the official area and you will find the ministers, negotiators as well as NGOs, campaigners, business people, academics, lobbists and basically anyone who can get a pass.\nThere are the public areas with lots of events and pavilions then the private rooms where the real negotiating take place.\nThe Green Zone is where the fringe events take place. This year it was beautiful, but unlike Glasgow, was nearly empty. The other areas, built by external organisations, were also very empty.\nAll the real action was in the Blue Zone. You enter COP more in hope than expectation, this year was no different with so many issues unresolved from Glasgow and promises on finance and emissions not being met from previous COPs.\nI formally handed over my role as the Inter-Parliamentary Parliament COP Rapporteur to the Egyptian Parliamentary Rapporteur H.E. Hon Karim Darwish and called on parliaments to hold governments to commitments in the IPU Parliaments' outcomes document and ever higher climate ambitions.\nI also called for there to be a greater working together as parliamentarians, between COPs.\nI spent alot of my time connecting people who I had met over years of climate and indigenous diplomacy, especially in the Pacific with our ministers and politicians, especially from Europe.\nI also sat alongside our ministers seeing what they did, as preparation for when I might enter the government, and be part of the UK Government team at COP.\nIt was really good to met a host of internation politicians including Sen Ben Cardin, Emmanuel Marfo Env Ctttee Chair Ghana, Ministers Hilary Jeune and Samuel A.Jinapor amongst many others.\nI stood alongside UJ Ministers when we took part in the UK Delegation Remembrance Day event.\nThere were several meetings in the UK Pavilion and Euroclima Pavillion, that I attended.\nI meet with Jaques Wagner again, who chairs Brazillian Senate Environment Committee and Ximena Arcia, who chairs the Argentine Senate Environment Committee.\nI attended meetings many international non-goverment organisations (NGOs), who wanted to raise issues within the UK including Christian Aid, Rainforest Foundation, Eden, Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, Global Resilience Partnership, Conservation International, Environmental Defence Fund amongst others.\nYou can watch more about my COP meetings here\nThe outcomes at COP fill me with mixed emotions. The deal on loss and damage is indeed historic.\nI spoke to the most senior politicians from countries like Vanuatu, Micronesia, Tuvalu and other Pacific Islands under real and extonential threat in our lifetime.\nThese countries cannot access any western finance to rebuild houses or construct seawalls.\nThese are not esoteric or political concerns they are real, vital and happening right now.\nThe deal gives them some hope but it MUST be delivered on.\nSee more here\nThe progress on emissions is far more disappointing. I deeply fear we will breach the 1.5C not by 2050 or 2100 but within a decade without much more severe action.\nThe number of oil and gas lobbyists and deals done undermines other good work done at COP. There is much talk about whether the process works and the need for a new process.\nThis is a real and vital debate but until a better process is agreed with delivery at its centre, we shouldn’t abandon COP for nothing. We would be worse off without it.\nSince the end of COP 27 there has been an Urgent Question on COP in the House of Commons.\nWatch my question below, to the Minister of State at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Nusrat Ghani MP.\nI asked about the release of previously agreed funding for pacific small island developing states.",

This document was produced yesterday afternoon almost a full day after the televised statement. The statement implied, for example, that people were to go back to work effective Monday. This was then clarified in the statement to say that this was effective from Wednesday. Businesses have been asked to put in measures for social distancing, yet the guidelines are yet to be published and are unlikely to be in place in time for them to make the necessary judgements. The rules around exercise and gatherings have been relaxed but to the point that the Chairman of West Yorkshire Police was on television this morning expressing how difficult this will be to enforce. Those who are asked to go back to work are largely those on the lowest income brackets and those who in a report produced by the office of national statistics yesterday are now far more likely to die from the coronavirus than their white-collar counterparts. Families are being asked to return to work without schools or early years settings being re-opened.\nWe needed clarity and reassurance. Instead, we have been asked to work with guidance that looks hurried, unevidenced and shows a lack of understanding of the needs of those trying to manage through this very difficult situation.\nEducation\nThe Government is urging more vulnerable children, who are already able to attend school, to do so. The Government has indicated that a phased re-opening of primary schools could begin from 1 June. This would involve reception, year one and year six with the ambition being for all primary school children to return to school. Years 10 and 12 should also receive some face to face contact with schools or colleges ahead of exams next year.\nThe Government has indicated that the decision about how to re-open more would remain with head teachers. Families who decide not to send their children back will not receive fines. The situation for students going to university in September is not yet clear. LCC is continuing it’s dialogue with Head Teachers this week to determine how to ease restrictions around schools.\nOutdoor exercise\nFrom Wednesday people in England will be able to take more outdoor exercise rather than once a day. Households will be able to drive to other destinations in England and people will be free to sit in parks and play sport.\nGiven these changes, LCC will re-open car parks in parks from Wednesday. In line with Government advice, playgrounds will remain closed as will outdoor gym equipment. LCC will check signs on all playgrounds and replace where signs have been removed.\nRe-starting the economy\nThe government has said that sectors of the economy that the Government has allowed to be open should be open. These include construction, manufacturing and food production. Phases two and three of the Government’s plan would see more businesses opening if they judge conditions to be right. This could include non-essential retailers opening from 1 June if they can maintain social distancing. Tighter restrictions are likely to remain in place for indoor public spaces as the risk of infection transmission is higher.\nPeople should continue to work from home if they can and that will remain the advice for the “foreseeable future.” Those who “can’t work from home” will be “encouraged to go to work” from Wednesday. The national advice continues to be that workers should avoid public transport. The Government has issued national guidance for employers to make workplaces “Covid safe”. Leeds City Council are currently developing our own plans to help a return to work for those members of staff who cannot work from home. My staff continue to work from home and will do so for the foreseeable future.\nMental Health\nFor anyone in Leeds suffering a mental health crisis the first port of call would be third sector support via Mindwell Leeds. Where it appears Mindwell cannot support an individual, they will refer them to the Mental Health Single Point of Access on 0300 300 1485. This is an NHS service available 24/7 and is the route to a crisis mental health assessment and any secondary-level care. If you believe someone to be at immediate risk of harm, please phone the police on 999. Police officers with mental health services via a dedicated number. If the person requires compulsory hospital admission, they will refer them to a Mental Health Professional. The Adult Emergency Duty Team operates between 5pm and 8am weekdays and continuously over weekends and bank holidays. The EDT handles undertaking urgent Mental Health Act assessments. Examples of social care emergencies which cannot wait until the next working day include:\nSome non-availability (e.g. due to hospital admission) of somebody who provides a high level of care for a person, such that the individual can’t be kept safe.\nSudden and dramatic increase in a person’s needs, found not to be due to an acute medical need.\nYou can contact the EDT on 0113 378 0644 or via edt.ss@leeds.gov.uk",

I also believe firmly that we must look to invest in new technology and have an ambitious plan to have this in use domestically by 2040, something I put directly to the Prime Minister when he took office.”\n“But Jet Zero does not deliver on this promise, instead using new technology as fanciful rhetoric serving as a fig leaf to hide climate inaction and lack of investment in real alternatives. Whilst innovation in aircraft, fuels and carbon capture is important for the long term, we need significant investment in infrastructure and development for this to be used at any kind of scale. It is highly unlikely that we will have enough new aircraft, fuelled by new technology, in service by 2050, that meets the ever-increasing demand in air travel.”\n“The other trick that this proposal plays is the reliance upon carbon offsetting. Whilst tree planting and other such schemes are positive, they do not repair the damage done through jet emissions.”\nIt looks as though instead we will see grandstanding of technology now, only for the targets to be reviewed later, all the while airport expansions and increased passenger numbers will see aviation pollution skyrocket.”\n“We must do all we can to temper the ever-increasing demand in air travel. This does not mean punishing people who want and deserve a break abroad, but by looking at frequent flying and the business miles of large organisations, questioning the necessity of expanding airports and investing properly in affordable and reliable alternative transport modes and in domestic tourism.”",

People want to see us go further on animal welfare. All animals deserve protection and I believe it is wrong to promise tougher legislation if promises are then not seen through.\nThe Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill would introduce a licensing system for keeping primates as pets, ban the live export of animals for fattening and slaughter, and allow the Government to make regulations about the importation of cats, dogs and ferrets into Great Britain. It was last scrutinised by Parliament on 18 November 2021. I am pleased the Bill passed a carry-over motion. The Government states it will be re-introduced as soon as time allows.\nI agree it is inhumane and wrong to keep primates as pets. The Bill does not deliver on promises made, as its licensing system allows for the continued breeding and selling of primates. The Opposition tabled an amendment at Committee Stage to introduce a full ban, but disappointingly the Government voted this down.\nYou can read my policy response to the bill at:\nYou may further like to read my response to other animal welfare issues at:\nI have long supported measures to ban live exports of animals for slaughter and fattening. I share welfare concerns about what many of those animals experience in being transported for a long time.\nWe need proper action on the issue of puppy smuggling. The Bill introduces a limit of five puppies and kittens per vehicle, but I think it should be three. Furthermore, I support increasing the minimum import age for puppies to six months and increased maximum penalties for those who illegally import dogs.\nThe import of fur and fur products into the UK, a barbarous and unnecessary trade, should be banned at the earliest opportunity. I support banning foie gras imports, the production of which is rightly banned in the UK.\nAdditionally, I support ending the import of wild animal trophies from threatened species. Any ban should cover all species classed as vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered and extinct in the wild.\nI further believe new laws must be the next step if the travel sector cannot meet the challenge of removing holidays and excursions that abuse animals.\nAll details are correct at date of publication shown at the top of the article",

My thoughts are set out in this article. Please see here for a selection of quotes to give you an impression of the correspondences that I have been reading over the past few days.\nHousing Priority\nA constituent has been in touch to ask about housing priority. They received an automated letter saying their priority was ending. I checked with Leeds City Council who said -“I can advise that the letter received is an automated letter alerting applicants to request a priority extension. Due to the current suspension of the choice based lettings system Housing Leeds have taken the proactive decision to extend applicants priority awards, we are currently compiling a list of 4500 priority awards which we will commence working through in the forthcoming weeks. In order to keep applicants updated with our actions a message will be posted on the CBL website.\nGovernment should put local government Directors of Public Health in the lead for contact tracing. This should be a priority over a centralised, outsourced, call centre focus run by external providers such as Serco. GPs are the backbone of local health services. They should be able to request home tests and the Government should provide them with the PPE and swabs to test patients. It is crucial that we integrate primary care into a locally-led test, trace and isolate regime. The government should provide capacity for widespread, regular community testing. Everyone showing symptoms should be able to access a test within 24 hours, and testing must also include people not showing symptoms. Health care workers, care staff, care home residents and other key public servants must be the priority for regular screening. As well as increasing capacity, testing must be faster and easier for people to access. Experts have suggested 50,000 or more would be most effective. The Government must base testing on what each local area needs. We must scale this up to succeed, including seeing whether some of the three quarters of a million NHS volunteers can play a role in their local area.\nStimulus for the tourism industry needed\nAs many of you know, I am the new Shadow Minister for Tourism and Heritage. I have been consulting with industry bodies, businesses and workers over the past weeks to fully understand the implications of Covid-19 on the sector. I thank travel weekly for allowing me to set out what I believe to be the right steps to save UK tourism.\nSupport for the self-isolating\nThe Government should spell out the support for those who will need to self-isolate in the coming months. Ministers should arrange local facilities, such as hotel rooms, for those who need to isolate away from family. This strategy will have a big impact on our lives. People need clarity to understand how this will work and what government will need of them. This also means having a responsive system designed to reflect the diverse community needs, such as language. The Government promised to launch the NHS app in mid-May. This is now running late. More countries such as Germany and Singapore are now moving to the Apple/Google-based system. This approach has the benefit of better privacy and better functionality. To protect the public, we must provide all key workers with necessary PPE. It is also vital that all public spaces are deep cleaned and sanitised, and we must ensure all public venues have adequate hand sanitiser. Since the UK entered lockdown, well over 100,000 people have travelled into the UK without quarantining. Quarantine for all UK arrivals should start immediately without further delay. Social care services must have support from local public health teams and local clinicians. Despite promises from the government, care homes still do not have named clinicians to support them with care of their residents.\nHeadingley Councillors in Food Drive\nPlease find below post regarding a food drive by the Headingley Councillors\n**Headingley & Hyde Park, Food Bank Donation drive**?

Residents in Otley were clearly impressed with this and with his campaigning locally, particularly on education and transport”\nHelen Toft, the former chair of Otley and Yeadon Labour Party said, “It was fantastic to see Hilary out in Otley. Residents were clearly surprised to see such a famous Parliamentarian on their doorsteps and as the Chair of the Brexit Select Committee, he was able to clearly answer their questions. It is obvious how well thought of Alex is in Parliament and that was reflected by residents here in Otley.”\nAlex Sobel said, “I’d like to thank Hilary for coming to Otley and for taking the time to talk to residents directly about their concerns. The Brexit crisis has such drastic potential effects so it is important that residents know how hard we are working in Parliament to ensure a solution that protects jobs, rights and living standards.

The announced change in law now means the six-month maximum sentence has been increased to 5 years. I really welcome this increase as it was simply inadequate for the severity of some of these terrible crimes. Increased sentences will send a strong message to perpetrators that animal abuse will not be tolerated in this country.\nChanging the law become even more important than ever as we saw a worrying trend of increases in animal cruelty during the coronavirus lockdown. Between March 2020 and August 2020, the RSPCA dealt with over 100,000 incidents, including complaints of cruelty and rescuing and caring for animals in need.\nThe Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill was introduced by Chris Loder MP in early 2020. This Bill, coupled with ‘Finn’s Law’, ensures that those who harm either service or any other animals are punished accordingly.\nWhilst the change in the law for tougher longer sentences is encouraging I believe it should be reviewed in two years to ensure that wild animals are protected as well as domestic ones.\nI have spoken extensively before on animal welfare in Parliament, including putting this question to the department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on having animal welfare inspectors:\nhttps://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2019-06-25.269141.h&s=animal+speaker%3A25680#g269141.q0\nAnd again I have written to this department to hold the Government to account on the number of animals transported to mainland Europe for slaughter:\nhttps://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2019-03 11.230872.h&s=animal+speaker%3A25680#g230872.q0\nI am also delighted to have joined the Puppy Smuggling Taskforce and support Dogs Trust in their efforts to raise awareness of and tackle the abhorrent puppy smuggling trade.\nAll details are correct at date of publication",

They responded by coming out onto the streets and signing the revoke Article 50 petition in their millions. No one supports her deal. It’s time to give the people the final say on Brexit.”\nConstituent Katie Hughes said “After months of frustration, anger and dismay at the chaos and incompetence in government, it was an amazing day.

Pleased to speak with so many people from Leeds North West and all over the country as well as on the Left Stage with Clive Lewis MP and Caroline Lucas amongst others. The Prime Minister has run out of road it is time we give the people a final say. #1million”\nThe March followed a statement on Mr Sobel's website, responding to the Prime Ministers 'address to the nation' last week. He said, \"So Prime Minister, I have decided. Next week I will support any amendments that would make the Withdrawal Agreement subject to a confirmatory referendum and will vote to revoke Article 50 if the Prime Minister will not support a substantial extension.

Speaking then to the Yorkshire Evening Post he said, “Life on the road is wholly unsuitable for creatures who need space to roam and pastures to graze.” This comment came during a time of protest over a circus using animals being staged at a site at Otley Old Road. Additional concern was raised by local animal rights protesters about the effect of air traffic noise on the animals with many saying it could cause enhanced distress.\nIn Parliament yesterday, campaign groups celebrated as new legislation sought to ban the practice. Speaking at the debate Mr Sobel said “I would like some reassurance from the Minister about a circus that operates in my constituency—Circus Mondao—which has a zebra and two camels. I have been campaigning for it to cease the use of these, and I ask that the Bill cover that so that I can happily go to Circus Mondao in the knowledge that, because of this Act, it is not using wild animals.”\nDavid Rutley MP (con, Macclesfield), Undersecretary of State for Food and Animal Welfare said, “The hon. Gentleman sets things out incredibly clearly, as he has done on others Bills I have been involved in. Absolutely—I can categorically say that, at commencement of this Act, those practices will no longer be able to be taken forward, so his campaign will have come to fruition. I hope that reassures him.”\nAnimal rights group PETA UK said “At PETA, we're thrilled that the government has finally introduced the long-awaited bill to ban wild animals in circuses. It comes after years of countless protests, ad campaigns, and pressure from celebrities and the public – including the 94% of British people who responded to the government consultation on this issue by demanding a complete and permanent ban.\nIt's unthinkable that in 2019, animals continue to be caged, chained, beaten into submission, and deprived of all that's natural and important to them. For them, the passage of this bill into law can't come soon enough. Around the world, animal circuses – as well as other institutions that cruelly imprison animals for human entertainment, including SeaWorld and other marine abusement parks – are on the decline, and we're rejoicing.”",

Prickly Pigs Hedgehog Rescue is located on St Richards Road in Otley and takes in sick and injured Hedgehogs and treats and cares for them until they can be successfully released back into the wild.\nThe rescue is a voluntary organisation run by Diane and Andrew Cook, who over the last 3 years have seen a significant increase in the number of Hedgehogs coming into the rescue each year. In their first year they had 150 hedgehogs, in their second year that increased to over 200 and this year they have so far cared for over 250.\nDue to the increased demand, Diane has given up her full-time teaching job to enable the rescue to continue. With such large numbers currently in the rescue, many of whom are this years young the daily feeding schedule starts at 6am and finishes at 1am.\nNot only do the rescue care and rehabilitate the animals, but they also go into schools and local groups, such as Scout and Guide groups to provide education on Hedgehogs and the ways in which we can help them in the wild. Hedgehogs are currently on the UK Wildlife Red list categorised as vulnerable; it is believed that they have suffered a 40% decline over recent years.\nAlex was keen to learn from Diane what the biggest threat to Hedgehogs currently were. The two biggest threats are Humans and Climate change. Over they years their natural habitat has seen a sharp decline because of more land being developed, the switch by many people from grass to artificial grass and generally people having less plants in their gardens, high fences and driveways, grass verges being tarmacked etc. The biggest cause of injury seen by the rescue is strimming injuries.\nClimate change is also impacting on the hedgehogs, as our seasons warm up it now means that Hedgehogs breed twice a year as opposed to one, but unfortunately due to the factors above means there is not enough food in the wild to sustain the increased population so many sadly die from malnutrition and thirst.\nAlex said “It was upsetting, but not surprising to hear those two other local hedgehogs’ charities have had to close, due to rising costs and the current cost of living crisis, this in turn is adding extra pressure on Prickly Pigs, demand wise”\n“Rescues such as Prickly Pigs have seen costs risings cost rising and Diane was telling me it costs on average £70 per Hedgehog they rescue, in medication, heating, which is currently costing them £600 per month (a figure that threatens the existence of the rescue), food, gloves etc. The rescue is looking at becoming a charity which will enable them access further funding.”\nThe rescue is currently working out of an old garage, but they are in desperate need of a new building, and they are looking at it costing around £10,000.\nAlex added “The rescue is constantly fundraising to be able to keep it operating and there are many ways in which people can help, and in these difficult times, no donation is too small. They currently need donations of Dog and Cat meat and Cat and Kitten biscuits; these can be dropped off at either Otley Lions or at the rescue itself at 49 St Richards Road. “\n“They also have a shop on their website (https://www.pricklypigs.co.uk/) where they sell many items including their new calendar for 2023 and Christmas cards both featuring Hedgehogs”\n“Donations can also be made via their Amazon Wishlist and also via a PayPal link on their website or via direct debit”\nAs Shadow Minister for domestic environment and nature recovery, added “The catastrophic decline of nature, habitats and wildlife continues, and over the last 12 years the Government have failed to address this issue, I am really pleased to be part of the Shadow DEFRA team as Labour commit to investing £28 billion a year for eight years into tackling the effects of Climate change when in power, which would quadruple the government’s current capital investment.”",

We are at breaking point in this profession. As the council continues to make cuts in other areas, more is put onto schools. We cannot provide the support that is needed for families without the funding to do so.”\nMr Sobel followed this up by saying “The fact that schools are willing to use the term “breaking point” is shocking to me and should be shocking to the Government.”\nAfter quoting many constituents, Mr Sobel summed up his speech. He said, “Children are being left not with the bare minimum of an education, but with an inadequate one, which promises to have knock-on effects for their future and for wider society. Even the most ardent Conservative must be aware that the cost to the public purse of the loss of revenue generated by reduced educational attainment in this country will be far from inconsequential, as will be the social cost of failing in the historical promise that has long linked the old to the young—that things will continue to get better, that the future will be brighter and that we pass on the promise of more than we had ourselves.\n“One constituent put it this way: ‘“As parent and teacher, I firmly believe the quality of education we are providing this generation is dire. Between funding cuts, inaccessible exams, no support for SEN or EAL, no trips and extracurricular activities being squeezed, I see a generation being told they are failures because we are not providing the funding or resources to help anyone except the most well adapted and able pupils to achieve. We are a laughing stock at best. Shame on this Government for letting it get to this.”’\nThose are not my words, but those of a parent and teacher in my constituency.”\nNote to editors\nFor information about both surveys please see:\nFor hansard please see:",

Environment minister Therese Coffey made clear that the plans would only be accepted if Leeds City Council submitted a reduced bid.\nAs Mr Sobel pointed out, this decision was made after the minister had previously praised Leeds on their plan, but before Leeds had requested the money to fund it.\nLeeds City Council have put forward a new offer, finding savings from their plan, but have stressed that any further reduction would risk the success of the project.\nAlex Sobel, MP for Leeds North West, used his platform as a member of the Parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee to interrogate the Environment Secretary about the decision.\nAddressing Mr Gove, Alex Sobel said\n“Three and a half years ago, eight cities were mandated to solve a problem, one of those was Leeds City Council, who worked with DEFRA and produced a very robust plan. Therese Coffey came here and sat where you are sat and praised Leeds for their work. Now, Leeds put forward that they need £40m to fund it and it’s been rejected. Is there a cap on how much councils can get and are you committed to them being able to meet their clean air targets?”\nMr Gove committed to investigate the matter and discuss it with Therese Coffey saying, “I take your point,” but stressed a limit to overall funding for all of the cities. Mr Gove would not be drawn on Mr Sobel’s further question about whether Derby’s decision to not go ahead with their air quality plan would create more funding for the other cities.\nFinally, Mr Sobel asked, “And if it's clear that the whole funding available, isn't sufficient for these mandated cities to meet their air quality targets, do you intend to go back to the treasury to seek more funds?”\nMr Gove replied that whilst he didn’t want to “strong arm the chancellor.” He would be happy to look at proposals from “fair minded bids and requests from local authorities for the support they need.”\nLeader of Leeds City Council Judith Blake said “I am pleased that Alex has held the Secretary of State to account and I’d like to thank him for his persistence on this issue. We have produced a counter offer to the Government which we believe is more than reasonable. It is vital that the Clean Air Zone is properly funded so that we can implement it successfully and ensure that local businesses are properly supported in the process.”",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_a-breath-of-fresh-air-my-blog/content_153.html": "A Breath of Fresh Air: My Blog\n- Alex Sobel\n- Aug 20, 2018\n- 3 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nLeeds City Council have completed their second consultation on the Clean Air Zone which is due to begin in Leeds next year. The city has shown leadership in tackling what has become a very serious public health issue as well as ambition with the size and scope of the zone.\nI promised at the last General Election to ‘make tackling air pollution an urgent priority’. This, alongside my work as a member of the Environmental Audit Committee and history of campaigning for environmental and public health issues, has led me to produce a second submission to Leeds City Council.\nIn my last submission, I highlighted the urgent need to address the air quality issues that exist outside of the current zone, particularly in areas such as Pool in Wharfedale and Otley. I also called on the local authority to look to more stringent measures, such as the World Health Organisation guidelines, as a target for the city’s air pollution. It is important to remember that there are no safe levels of air pollution, so it is imperative that we set the highest possible bar for air quality.\nIn this submission, I highlighted the need for improving infrastructure. As well as the ‘stick’ for vehicles that contravene the zone, we need a ‘carrot’ for the cleanest vehicles to enter the city. This means charging points as well as electric vehicle priority for taxi and hackney carriage licencing. We must also give priority for funding bids to businesses with fleets of vans or cars to support the transition to electric vehicles. Businesses should have confidence around deliveries and as part of supporting the electric transition, Leeds should invest in hubs where electric charging is located for heavy vehicles to drop goods for clean electric vans to undertake last mile delivery.\nWe must also invest in out of city parking and cycling infrastructure in order to reduce the number of private cars entering the city. This includes researching locations for park and rides, and look to establishing new sustainable cycle routes into the city centre as well as developing existing ones.\nWe need the best possible public transport links into the city centre. This would require providing more frequent bus services connecting towns with each other and the city centre. First Bus have promised a ten-minute express service (X84/X85) from Otley to Leeds. This should be introduced prior to the introduction of the CAZ.\nFinally, we need to acknowledge the impact of air pollution on the city’s children. According to UNICEF, there are at least 174,200 of children are growing up in Leeds City with unsafe levels of air pollution. Primary school children in Leeds are being exposed to 30 per cent more pollution than adults while walking along busy roads due to their closer proximity to vehicle exhaust fumes and children are the most proportionately highly affected compared to their contribution to polluted air. It is vital that we embark on a public awareness campaign, engaging and informing schools and other organisations about air pollution and promoting clean transport routes to schools. This is something I have been working on over recess and hope to see come to fruition in the not-too-distant future.\nToxic air pollution is a public health catastrophe in need of a radical solution. As a city, we are a in a unique position in which we have an opportunity make a real difference to air quality levels– now and for generations to come. I believe that my constituents deserve to breathe clean air, and I believe that it is only with a Clean Air Zone that we can make this a reality.",

The Government will provide funding to develop local outbreak control plans.\nI broadly welcome this step. It is what local authorities including Leeds have been asking for as local authorities have the required expertise through public and environmental health. The Government must ensure proper data sharing with councils and powers to intervene if spikes occur. It is also important to stress that the responsibility for the success of track and trace lies with the Government. Localising the roll out cannot mean devolving responsibility.

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_indicative-votes-how-i-voted/content_409.html": "Indicative Votes – How I Voted\n- Alex Sobel\n- Mar 28, 2019\n- 2 min read\nOn Monday, we secured indicative votes for MPs – the aim being to break the Brexit impasse. Yesterday, we voted on eight options.\nI voted first and foremost to support the Beckett amendment, which would guarantee the people a final say on Brexit with the option to remain in the EU. I am firm in my view that this is the best (and perhaps the only) way out of the Brexit mess. I was also one of the very few MPs to support revoking Article 50. I believe that this must be used as a last resort to avoid a No Deal Brexit. The Cherry Amendment was worded with this exact intention calling a vote the day before the leave date and to set the revocation of Article 50 as the default option, to be used if the House of Commons couldn’t positively vote for any option.\nI find it regrettable that motions to do with process (how we get to a position) became mixed with outcome (what relationship we have with the EU). I would have preferred a single motion just saying that Parliament wished to remain rather than two motions; one on a Public Vote and another to revoke Article 50 which both give a process to stay in the EU. My view has always been it is up to you, the electorate, to have the final say. This is consistent with my pledges at the last General Election and in my time as an MP since then.\nThere were a number of Soft Brexit options available. I supported three of these, to give Parliament the widest possible range of options which we could hold a second referendum on. Let me be clear, I would support a referendum over and above any of the soft Brexit option. I know that any form of Brexit will leave us worse off and I believe the British people should have the final say over any Brexit Deal. We want a second referendum, but in politics – as in life -we do not always get what we want. We must ask ourselves what – if all else fails – we would be willing to live with. For me, jobs, rights and environmental protections must be protected in the face of a No Deal Brexit.\nI voted passionately against all the hard Brexit options on the table. I will not stand by and allow a Brexit which hurts my constituents and my country. The Conservatives may be happy to chop and change their mind depending on the status of the Prime Minister but I am certainly not.\nThe Beckett Amendment garnered the highest number of votes with 268 votes and a further 74 abstentions. I am working with colleagues across the House to build a majority for a people’s vote, when we next have indicative votes and/or when the Government tables the Withdrawal Agreement. Please know that I am working extremely hard to give you the final say on our status in Europe.\nNow is the time for clear minds and focus. I will vote against the third meaningful vote if it is to be tabled tomorrow. I will then move onto Monday with the clear aim of giving you the final say on Brexit.",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_antisocial-behaviour-in-hyde-park-and-headingley-an-update/content_429.html": "Antisocial behaviour in Hyde Park and Headingley: An update\n- Alex Sobel\n- Aug 19, 2021\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nNoise nuisance and antisocial behaviour is and has been a long-term issue in the Headingley and Hyde Park area. Whilst the problems are easy to identify, sustainable solutions are much more complex and rely on the work of several agencies, as well as residents themselves, I have put together below a guide to the issue, the steps that I and others are currently taking and information about how you can get involved to help.\nBackground\nThere have been numerous complaints about antisocial behaviour in the area, which have spanned several years and are not limited to one household or one set of tenants. The transient nature of the student population of Hyde Park and Headingley means that turnover is high and single actions against households is not likely to stop the problem in the longer term. It is important to note that the vast majority of students are good neighbours, respectful and contributors to our area. That said, we know that a small minority can cause major distress, both for long term residents and for other students. Currently, the below organisations are aware and involved:\nUniversities\nCouncillors\nPolice\nSafer communities (Council)\nASB Teams at Leeds Council\nWho is responsible for tackling anti-social behaviour (ASB)?\nTypically, local authorities and the police lead on tackling anti-social behaviour. However, many public, private and social organisations work to prevent and respond to ASB. There is a legal framework to encourage public sector bodies to work together to tackle ASB. There have been long-standing concerns that this framework is not as effective as it could be.\nWhere we are now:\nWe facilitated a meeting to discuss the issues recently with the above parties. The outcomes are as follows:\nThe universities agreed that they would review and increase their support for the area, and that residents could contribute to this review by e-mailing their experiences to neighbourhood.helpline@leeds.ac.uk You can still e-mail this address with your thoughts now.\nBoth Leeds Beckett University and the University of Leeds have now confirmed long term funding which includes the “pre-fresher” period (June-September) as well as longer term plans.\nAnti-Social behaviour teams in LS6 currently are running an “enhanced” service, they are moving from this to a “dedicated” service, one bespoke to our area and the issues we face. Some of the issues being looked at include; shift timings, hours of operation and number of shifts; shift patterns & anti-social hours; staffing; how the service links with existing Police resources; the balance of prevention and reactive response; the impact of the pending Leedswatch review – due for implementation in September; stakeholder Communications and Performance Management\nIn this interim period, having discussed provision with Leedswatch who run the out of hours service, it has been agreed that there will now be a dedicated service for the Inner North West Area. This has now been implemented and these response shifts are 6pm – 4am. This is an interim measure of a dedicated resource whilst longer term plans are being worked on and implemented as they are ready.\nThe Local Councillors are dedicated to securing a long-term solution but these are the first key steps. Further meetings will be taking place before term starts to discuss progress.\nAs you may have also seen from the HHP Councillors Facebook update\n“Over the weekend there was an extensive patrol & monitoring of properties where there have been issues recently, with a view to try to stop further issues before they occur. There were re-visits to the properties recently served with section 80s & closure warnings. Officers attended a number of Out Of Hours calls to properties also.\n85 Section 80’s were issued last week to addresses in: the Escourts, the Royal Parks, the Brudenells, the Norwoods, the Trelawns, the Mayvilles, the Hessles, Cardigan Road, the Winstons, the Granbys, the area around the Manors & Richmonds and others.\nFive noise warning letters were also issued in and around LS6.”\nMy role and how I can help.\nWhilst the legislation delegates powers to local authorities and the Police, I am aware that residents have called for changes to the current legislations and laws. Whilst changing legislation is complex, lengthy and not always a viable option, I am keen to know what specific changes you would like to see and to which legislation. Below I have provided some information on the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 which is the most relevant to this case. Please email me at alex@alexsobel.co.uk with your thoughts on this and in the first instance I will raise them with the Minister for Housing, Communities and Local Government.\nWritten Parliamentary Questions\nI have tabled the below Parliamentary Questions\n1.To ask the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, what steps his Department is taking to help local authorities tackle noise complaints and antisocial behaviour in Yorkshire and the Humber.\n2.To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what strategies the police are deploying to (a) tackle antisocial behaviour by students in residential areas and (b) encourage those students to change their behaviour.\nI have Written to Tracy Brabin’s team to ask for support and I am seeking a meeting with the new deputy Mayor for Policing.\nUnfortunately, Labour are not in Government, but I hope to see the following policy implemented in the next Parliament. https://labour.org.uk/press/government-urgently-needs-to-tackle-staggering-increase-in-anti-social-behaviour/\nWhat to do if you are experiencing ASB\nIf you experience any noise nuisance at night (past 6pm), please call 0113 376 0337 to get through to our anti-social behaviour teams.\nIf you are in any immediate danger call the police on 999, or 101 if you need to speak to the police but it is not urgent.\nIf you wish to speak to the universities about a specific property, please e-mail neighbourhood.helpline@leeds.ac.uk.",

Examples include rudeness, offensive comments, derogatory remarks, making inflammatory statements, or raising unsubstantiated allegations made towards these third parties.\nAll threats against either my staff will be taken very seriously and if staff feel scared or threatened at any point during a conversation with a constituent, the interaction may be ended at any time.\nUnreasonable demands\nA demand becomes unacceptable when it starts to (or when complying with the demand would) impact substantially on the work my staff carry out on my behalf.\nExamples of this behaviour include:\n-\nrepeatedly demanding response within an unreasonable timescale\n-\ninsisting on seeing or speaking to a particular member of staff, when that is not possible\n-\nrepeatedly changing the substance of a complaint or raising unrelated concerns\nAn example of such impact would be that the demand takes up an excessive amount of staff time and in doing so disadvantages other constituents and prevents their own complaint from being dealt with quickly.\nUnreasonable levels of contact\nSometimes the volume and duration of contact made to my office by an individual causes problems. This can occur over a short period, for example, a number of calls in one day or hour.\nIt may occur over the life-span of a complaint when a constituent repeatedly makes long telephone calls to us or inundates us with copies of information that has been sent already or that is irrelevant to the complaint.\nI consider that the level of contact has become unacceptable when the amount of time spent talking to a constituent on the telephone, or responding to, reviewing and filing emails or written correspondence impacts on my offices’ ability to deal with that complaint, or with other constituents’ complaints.\nHarassment\nMy staff have the right to carry out their duties free from harassment or threats of harassment. I ask everyone to respect that my staff are delivering a service on my behalf and therefore this may not reflect their own views or preferences.\nExamples of behaviours I consider to be harassment against my office include:\n-\nrecording telephone discussions and publishing the information online such as through YouTube, Vimeo or Twitter;\n-\ncontacting staff using their personal details or social media presence such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn;\n-\npublishing personal, sensitive or private information about staff online or other public domains such as noticeboards or newsletters.\nUnacceptable or excessive demands\nA demand becomes unacceptable when it starts to (or when complying with the demand would) impact substantially on the work of my office.\nExamples of this behaviour include:\n-\nrepeatedly demanding a response within a unreasonable timescale\n-\ninsisting on, or refusing to, speak to a particular member of staff, when that is not possible\n-\nrepeatedly changing the substance of a complaint or raising unrelated concerns\n-\nMaking repeated and unnecessary contact during the course of us dealing with a complaint or carrying out an investigation\n-\nRefusing to accept a decision where explanations for the decision have been provided.\nAn example of such impact would be that the demand takes up an excessive amount of staff time and in doing so disadvantages other constituents and prevents their own complaint from being dealt with quickly.\nUnacceptable and persistence levels of contact\nSometimes the volume and duration of contact made to our service by an individual causes problems. This can occur over a short period or over the life-span of a complaint.\nI consider that the level of contact has become unacceptable when the amount of time spent talking to a constituent on the telephone, or responding to, reviewing and filing emails or written correspondence impacts on our ability to deal with that complaint, or with other constituents’ complaints.\nUnacceptable or persistent levels of contact include:\n-\nContinuous contact while my office is in the process of considering a matter\n-\nRepeated telephone calls over a short period, for example, a high number calls in one day or week\n-\nLengthy telephone calls repeating the same points of discussion\n-\nHigh volumes of information provided by email or post referencing the same issues\n-\nunnecessarily or excessive copying us into emails to other parties.\nRefusal to co-operate\nWhen looking at a complaint, my office will need to ask the individual who has contacted us to work with us. This can include agreeing with us:\n-\nthe complaint we will look at\n-\nto provide us with further information, evidence or comments on request, or\n-\nhelp us by summarising their concerns.\nSometimes, an individual repeatedly refuses to co-operate and this makes it difficult for us to proceed. My office will always seek to assist someone if they have a specific, genuine difficulty complying with a request.\nHowever, it is unacceptable to bring a complaint to my office and then not respond to clear and appropriate requests by staff.\nReasonable adjustments\nI understand that some constituents may find it difficult for them to express themselves or communicate clearly, especially when they are anxious or upset. In order to do this, we ask that they explain what adjustments they’re looking for and how this will ensure they can access the service my office offers.\nMy office will always consider making reasonable adjustments for a constituent asked to do so. Examples of adjustments we can consider are:\n-\nwe could consider using different methods of communication;\n-\nproviding written communication in large print, coloured text, or in translation;\n-\ngiving clear warnings if conversations become unproductive and allowing constituents to opportunity to modify their behaviour before ending a call.\nHowever, I do not expect my staff to accept being subjected to aggressive, offensive, threatening or abusive actions, language or behaviour.\nI may still use the policy if there are actions or behaviours which are having a negative effect on our staff or our work even where a reasonable adjustment has been made.\nActions I may take\nWhen my office experiences behaviour or demands which are unacceptable, I may consider taking more formal action. The actions I will consider can include the following:\n-\nWarning the constituent about their behaviour and requesting that the constituent modifies their behaviour in future contact with us.\n-\nAppointing a specific point of contact for the constituent\n-\nCommunicating only in writing or via a representative\n-\nDeciding not to investigate a complaint on the basis that it has been pursued in a way that is unacceptable\n-\nStop all communication with a constituent\n-\nRestricting or limiting contact\nWhere it is decided that formal action must be taken to manage someone’s behaviour I or my office, will inform them of the decision in writing. A note will be placed on our records to this effect.",

The new requirements impose significant costs on entertainers visiting the UK. For many years, the Irish Republic has been a convenient first port of call for entertainers beginning their Europe-wide tour. There is a real risk that the UK’s new visa requirements will force acts to cancel the Irish—or British—leg of their trip.\nThe signatories to the letter call on the Home Office to revert to the tried and tested Certificate of Sponsorship system to prevent further damage to the UK’s position as a leading cultural center in Europe.\nAlex Sobel MP said:\n‘The Home Office needs to apply some common sense to this issue and reinstate the old system for visiting entertainers. This is bureaucratic box-ticking of the worst sort. The danger is performers arriving from the US and Canada are likely to organise shorter European Tours - or not at all - due to the additional costs and bureaucracy. At a time when we’re told the UK ought to be more outward looking and business focussed the Home Office has chosen to impose a silly short-sighted policy on one of Britain’s most productive industries.'",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_meanwood-community-centre-transport-event/content_411.html": "Meanwood Community Centre Transport Event\n- Alex Sobel\n- Nov 16, 2019\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nAlex Sobel’s transport meeting in Meanwood was a resounding success. It was great to see almost 75 residents from the Meanwood area excited and engaged to contribute their local knowledge and lived experience, together with the expertise and insight of our panel. A massive thank you to Cllr Peter Carlill, Les Webb, Robin Lovelace, Alex Sobel, our Chair Emma Flint, and all attendees for taking part. Below is a summary of the suggestions and insights made in the meeting. The meeting was in broad agreement that there is a big problem with transport in Leeds. The city’s public transport is not fit for purpose, with expensive and unreliable buses, and much of the city inaccessible by train. Many of us feel unsafe cycling or walking, and our roads are gridlocked, filled with large cars often driven by only one person. To improve Leeds’ transport, we need to put cycling, walking, and public transport at the heart of our infrastructure decisions. We had a discussion about some of the specific issues which plague the Meanwood area. We noted that: • The zebra crossing on Monk Bridge Road is unsafe. • The junction by Waitrose as a whole is not safe for pedestrians or cyclists. • Many residents would like to walk into Leeds, but Sheepscar junction makes it difficult and dangerous. • The 38 bus was removed and no replacement has been provided for it, meaning many residents are stranded. Many attendees wanted to be able to walk more in their local area, but several issues get in the way. Obstructions on the pavement, including from parked cars, foliage, bushes and bins mean that many pedestrians are pushed into walking on the road unsafely. These obstructions often prevent wheelchair users or parents with prams from being able to use the pavement at all. It was suggested that Leeds City Council adopt an app or a website which residents could use to report obstructions to the pavement, so that they can be dealt with fast. A large discussion centred around speed limits, and the need for more 20mph zones to ensure the safety of all road users. In addition to making roads in areas with lots of pedestrians and cyclists 20mph, we need to have proper enforcement of speed limits. We talked about how to encourage parents to use a sustainable mode of transport to get their children to school, especially where the school is walking distance away. Having parents waiting in cars to drop off or pick up their children produces a massive amount of pollution. We discussed electric scooters and electric cars as greener modes of transport, or whether we could have more bike storage installed in schools. We recognised that parents might have safety concerns about walking to school, and how some of our pedestrian safety measures could help. On cycling, many residents expressed how they would love to cycle more to get around, but many practical problems get in the way. Leeds must become a safe city for cyclists, with more segregated cycling, and road surfaces free from obstructions such as leaves, drains, and potholes. Residents expressed frustration with bike theft, and suggested installing more secure public bike storage as the solution. Some residents were frustrated with the difficulty in getting bikes fixed, expressing their wish for a remote bike-fixing service. Public transport was discussed at length. Many of us are frustrated with how expensive the buses are in Leeds, and how unfair it is that the separate bus companies and train operators will not work together to integrate their ticketing. We talked about how transport needs a fixed timetable, which is more convenient and reliable for commuters. Road users often do not show enough respect for each other, with drivers often not being aware of how dangerous and frightening roads can be for pedestrians and cyclists. We discussed the need for a change in the culture on the roads, and more mutual understanding between road users. The role of technology and innovation in improving our transport was frequently brought up. We can use cameras to more strictly enforce rules such as speed limits, traffic lights, and parking regulations. It was suggested that we could use technology to monitor the journeys people take, and encourage travelling in the most sustainable way. For example, we could only levy congestion or parking charges on people who commute alone in a large car, to encourage carpooling. We could also monitor the length of the journeys a given person has taken and the availability of alternative transport, then charge them more only if they could have made the journey without a car. We decided that our large-scale principles for transport are a good starting point, but that we need to move from these broad visions to the actual details of our infrastructure. Suggestions for future projects included: o Installing a park and ride at Lawnswood roundabout o Re-opening ‘Leeds Cycle Hub’ at the train station o Bringing back short-journey cycle hire schemes in Leeds o Taxing city centre parking to fund alternative transport o Redesigning the city centre to be car-free o A congestion charge in Leeds By far the biggest take away from the meeting is how crucial it is that we come together and talk about how to change and improve our communities. One way to do this is by regularly clearing our streets to hold street parties to meet and get to know each other. Through talking to each other about our transport problems and our ideas for solutions, we can work together to make Leeds a safer, greener city, where our transport works for everyone.",

Today the cabinet will meet to discuss and review lockdown. It is likeley that the guiding principle is the R value (R0) which reflects the rate of infection. For a deeper discription of what this means please see this helpful article from ITV: https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-28/coronavirus-q-a-what-is-the-r-value/\nExcess Mortality Rate\nThe below graph is disturbing. It highlights that the picture painted by the Government isn’t the whole story. People are sadly passing away from Coronoavirus but the official statistics seem to be failing to record it. We must also begin to understand the impact of mortality from people passing away from illnesses not directly caused by coronavirus but where it has had an impact. For example, changes in resuscitation procedures or simply people reluctant to call an ambulance could be having a significant impact . Fundamentally, we need better more accurate reporting of death and a lot more completed tests.\nExit Strategy\nWe in Labour supported the government’s decision to extend the lock-down. This is saving lives and must not be ended until it is safe to do so. We are however calling on the government to commit to publishing an exit strategy as soon as possible. The Government should hold talks with community leaders in the coming days on how they could put in place such a strategy. The British public have made great sacrifices to make the lock-down work and they deserve to be part of an adult conversation about what comes next. Countries across the world are publishing exit strategies and the UK government is behind the curve on this. We need to see a significant step-change in the government’s response to this pandemic. The Government must make decisions faster. The government should outline the sectors of the economy and the core public services that are most likely to see restrictions eased. This lock-down is not affecting people equally. In fact, it has exacerbated existing inequalities in our country. A family living in an overcrowded flat will have particular challenges. It is hard to imagine the daily horror of someone trapped in a home with his or her abuser. The government has a duty to do what it can to ease these pressures on people. We want the government to publish its plans so that we can scrutinise them. We don’t think it’s right to put forward a rival plan of our own. Labour will work with the government in bringing forward a plan, and then getting that right.\nWaste recycling centres re-opening\nThis week, the Local Government Secretary asked councils to plan for the organised reopening of their waste and recycling sites. Updated guidance will be published shortly to support local government to open sites safely during the coronavirus pandemic. Local work is progressing to work this through so that sites can be open in a safe manner, and communications will follow once this plan and timeline is clear.\nEmergency Dental Treatment\nRegular dental services have been halted. However, dental practices remain open and accessible to patients, both for those who recently accessed the practice and those who do not have a regular dentist – and NHS England continues to work with dental practices to confirm this. If patients cannot access a Dental Practice, and for Out of Hours services, patients can contact NHS 111. Patients will be triaged and offered advice, support and analgesia/antibiotics as appropriate. For patients who do still require face to face care, a number of practices in each locality, across Yorkshire and the Humber, have been identified to provide an urgent treatment service as required. These centres are in the process of being established and will be accessible upon receipt of enhanced PPE. It is hoped that some of these centres will be operational this week (w/c 27 April 2020), subject to the required PPE being available. Patients presenting at A&E should be advised, if their condition is not an emergency, to contact a Dental Practice or 111 Out of Hours.\nUnderwriting Loans Labour has been making the case for some weeks that the Chancellor should underwrite 100% of loans for small businesses. It is welcome that he has seen reason and now agreed to 100% underwriting for the smallest loans. There remain very serious issues about the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). Especially for for small businesses seeking more than £50,000 support. They will be asking why they cannot have quick turnaround loans and whether CBILS will remain as slow and cumbersome as it has so far been. There are also massive challenges facing businesses for whom debt is not the answer.

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_coronavirus-update-thursday-14th-may/content_471.html": "Coronavirus Update Thursday 14th May\n- Alex Sobel\n- May 14, 2020\n- 3 min read\nToday, the death toll stands at 33,614. We are also seeing the measures that we have had in place over the past 7 weeks being rolled back as people return to work and use of our roads is expanded. News today that Transport for London and major rail operators across the country had been expecting and preparing for some return on Monday 18th only to learn on the night of Boris Johnson’s announcement of the earlier date fills me with far less confidence that their is a sound strategy underpinning these announcements that prioritises public health above all else.\nBack to Work Guidance\nI welcome that the Government’s guidance has adopted some of the measures called for by the TUC and Labour. Unfortunately, this guidance still falls short of providing a clear plan for a safe return to work outside the home. There is no obligation for employers with fewer than 50 employees to publish risk assessments, which is a missed opportunity. After a decade of budget cuts, the Health and Safety Executive does not have the resources to inspect workplaces. Without enough funding, the executive cannot enforce laws protecting workers and public health.\nTom Riordan\nI would like to congratulate Leeds City Council Chief Executive Tom Riordan. The Government has asked Tom to take a key role in its contact tracing programme across the country. He will lead on ensuring that the arrangements for linking contact tracing work at local level as well as ensuring that the partnerships and capacity are in place to support this, not only in Leeds but country-wide. Tom will take on this important national role for three months, alongside his responsibilities at Leeds City Council. Both the council and the government acknowledge his position as chief executive is also crucial to the handling of the pandemic in Leeds.\nRelationship Matters\nLeeds City Council has launched a new website that aims to help families who are having relationship difficulties. The website, provides information, tips and advice for disagreements and arguments between family. The new site is at www.relationshipmatters.org.uk. It will help people recognise when regular conflict may be having a negative impact on families, in particularly children. It aims to reduce this impact by helping families navigate common situations such as;\nRegular arguments and shouting\nWorries about separation/divorce\nManaging sulking, silent treatment and slamming doors\nWorries and anxiety getting in the way of managing everyday life\nDifficulty apologising and moving on after an argument\nConflict via hurtful texts, emails, or social media\nThe new website provides tips and information to help families stay calm and work out what needs to happen. It will also signpost them to get further help where appropriate.\nUK Freedom Movement\nShocking posters have emerged to promote the ‘mass gatherings’ in Middleton Park, Middleton, and Woohouse Moor, Hyde Park. The “UK Freedom Movement” have told people to “bring a picnic”, with the message encouraging participants to “say no to the Coronavirus Bill”. The reckless messages are at odds with the government’s advice on social distancing to limit the spread of coronavirus. In a statement, West Yorkshire Police said the following. “West Yorkshire Police urges people to continue to observe social distancing rules. We hope the compliance we have seen from the vast majority of people will continue in the weeks ahead and our approach will continue to focus on engaging, explaining and encouraging, with enforcement as a last resort, should it be necessary. Our neighbourhood officers’ pre-existing positive relationship with local communities has really helped us maintain a good working relationship and we continue to be there to reassure people and to deal with criminality.” I would urge anyone considering attending to please reconsider.",

It is crucial that we integrate primary care into a locally-led test, trace and isolate regime. The government should provide capacity for widespread, regular community testing.

Having met with Pool C of E Primary School, I can reflect their concern that this policy is going to affect their current pupils who live just outside the closest school area.\nBramhope Primary School is 4.5 miles away from Prince Henry’s and in some parts of Bramhope, Prince Henry’s is their fourth nearest school. Children living on Pool Bank New Road, for example, are only 3.5 miles away from Prince Henry’s and will be placed in the lowest category for admissions.\nWhat’s more, in the results driven modern education culture, there are clear benefits for Prince Henry’s in including children from a higher socio-economic background. Whilst we accept the benefit to them and to the Bramhope pupils that wish to attend Prince Henry’s, it is to the detriment of pupils that fall outside of this and to the other, much closer secondary school who currently has Bramhope in its catchment.\nI have long campaigned against academies and against Multi Academy Trusts. There is no proof that they are any better than maintained schools and there is a loss of local accountability.

The extension of support comes in response to lobbying from the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Ukraine, a bipartisan group of MPs who support promoting and strengthening relations between the UK and Ukrainian parliaments. Led by Co-Chairs Alex Sobel MP and Bob Seely MP, members of APPG on Ukraine wrote directly to UK Vodafone CEO Ahmed Essam seeking an extension of free calls and texts to Ukrainian phone numbers, support that has been in place since Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The members of APPG on Ukraine welcome Vodafone’s decision to extend this support to UK customers until the end of January 2024, however believe that support should continue until at least until Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office travel advice says it is safe to travel to Ukraine. Alex Sobel MP, Co-Chair APPG on Ukraine, said: We are grateful for this slight extension of support from Vodafone. There are so many people impacted by the ongoing war in Ukraine and they still need this support to keep in touch with friends, family and loved ones in Ukraine. Bob Seely MP, Co-Chair APPG on Ukraine, said: I welcome the extension as it allows those suffering from the effects of the war and separation from the families and friends to stay connected with the loved ones back home in Ukraine. We all understand how important this is.",

The total number of reported deaths of people who tested positive with COVID-19 at LTHT up to 5pm 13 April is 88. Our incredible teams have now been able to care for and discharge safely more than 100 COVID-19 positive patients back to their homes and families.\nFurlough scheme extended\nI am pleased to report that our campaign to extend the start date for the Furlough scheme has been extended. For many, the cut off date in February meant that those in new employment could not be furloughed. Last month, I wrote to the chancellor to challenge this. I am now delighted to say the date has been extended to the 19th March. See here for more details\nCare workers\nTonight, we will be clapping our carers. This is an important signal to them that we appreciate the work that they and other healthcare workers are doing. That said, at the time of writing we are failing as a country to keep these workers, and the facilities they protect, safe from Covid-19. The number of care homes in Leeds with confirmed cases/outbreaks is now 17, with 7 care homes closed and 10 remaining operational with restrictions in place. My office continues to be in contact with care homes in Leeds North West and we are trying where we can to bridge the gap by making contact with those fantastic individuals and businesses who are making protective equipment. If you are someone who can help to provide PPE or a supplier of products such as toilet paper or hand sanitiser, please contact me on alex@alexsobel.co.uk\nUpdated guidance for those with health or medial needs\nThe government has amended an aspect of the guidance on what you can and can’t do during the lockdown if you need to exercise more than once because of a specific health need. This follows a legal challenge from two families with children with autism. Section 15 of the guidance now states: You can leave your home for medical need. If you (or a person in your care) have a specific health condition that requires you to leave the home to maintain your health – including if that involves travel beyond your local area – then you can do so. This could, for example, include where individuals with learning disabilities or autism require specific exercise in an open space two or three times each day – ideally in line with a care plan agreed with a medical professional.\nDomestic Violence\nThe police are still continuing to fully support anyone who needs urgent help from domestic abuse by calling 999. Tapping in 55 on the keypad will signal to the call operator that you are in danger, allowing them to send officers to your location. If you are a domestic abuse victim and need to escape your home, support and accommodation are available at LDVS and Leeds Housing Options. Safe spaces are available for you with social distancing measures in place to protect you and your children. See Leeds.gov/domesticviolence for more details\nTemple Green Testing Site\nThe new testing facilities at Temple Green opened at the end of last week and have been operational over the bank holiday weekend. The target for the fully operational test centre is to get everyone from initial scan of their individual bar code to leaving the site in six minutes. We now know that independent care sector workers will be included in the testing cohort to support this area of the system, as will staff from children’s services, and other key workers.\nReporting a breach of coronavirus restrictions: The police have been granted additional powers to enforce new Government rules designed to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. To report anything which contravenes those rules the public are being encouraged use the WYP online Breach of Coronavirus Restrictions reporting form, and have reiterated that 999 should only be used if a crime in in progress or there is a threat to life.\nTurn2us Coronavirus Grant Fund: This grant fund has been set up to support people who have lost their income as a result of the Coronavirus to meet the cost of their immediate basic household expenses. It provides a one-off crisis grant of £500 per household. Applicants need to satisfy all of the following criteria: evidence of at least a 50% reduction in earnings, a resident of the UK / Republic of Ireland, not currently in Further or Higher Education, over 18, with less than £1K savings (single person) or less than £2K savings (couple/family).

Remember, stay safe and that coronavirus has not gone away.\nFriends and Relatives\nFrom Saturday, households containing one person, or one adult and children, can form a ”support bubble’‘ with one other household. The second household can contain any number of people. People can already meet outside in groups of up to six people from different households. Permitted numbers of people includes children, and you should still follow social distancing – remaining 2m (6ft) apart from others. Unless those people are part of the same household or support bubble. The rules are different for people who are shielding.\nExercise The advice remains “stay at home” as much as possible. But the Government allows some non-contact outdoor sport. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries. People must stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis are all allowed in England. Golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should still not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\nQuarantine Most people entering the UK – including British citizens – now have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys. The Government advises all passengers to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering – which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory.\nWork People who can work from home in England should continue to do so “for the foreseeable future”. The Government encourages people who must travel to their workplace to walk, cycle or drive if possible. Public Transport is likely to become overcrowded and face social-distance queuing. Wearing a face covering on public transport will be mandatory in England from 15 June. Workplaces should be made safe for staff. Employers must ensure more cleaning, staggered working shifts and no hot-desking.\nWorking at Other Peoples Homes If you’re a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else’s home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. You shouldn’t carry out work in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms. The only exception to this rule is if it’s a household emergency. In homes where someone is vulnerable, you should avoid face-to-face contact and follow strict hygiene rules.\nShielding People in England and Wales who have are to staying home and shield can now spend some time outdoors again. Those with families can go out once a day with members of their own household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing.\nMoving House House moves and viewings have resumed again in England. Potential buyers and renters are able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in.\nChildminders and Nurseries Childminders and nannies in England can return to work – and the government has issued fresh guidance.\nSchools and Universities Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children. Exact rules vary, but head teachers and local councils have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Strict hygiene and social distancing is being enforced. This includes smaller class sizes, staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. But, the government’s plan for all primary school years in England to go back to class for the final four weeks of the summer term is now being dropped. Instead, the Government will give schools “flexibility” over whether to admit more pupils. From 15 June, he government says schools will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils. This is in addition to their “continued remote, home learning”. But, at the Downing Street briefing, Matt Hancock conceded that secondary schools may not fully reopen until September. Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September.\nHigh Street Shopping All non-essential retailers can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. Outdoor markets and car showrooms can now reopen if they are “Covid-secure”. Garden centres are now back open across the UK. DIY chains – some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown – have also reopened many of their shops.\nHairdressers, pubs and cafes The Government will allow Zoos, safari parks, drive-in cinemas and other outdoor attractions to reopen in England from 15 June. Places of worship will also be allowed to reopen for private prayer shortly although not for services or events. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will open from 4 July at the earliest in England. But, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen later.",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_reflections-on-hate/content_265.html": "Reflections on Hate\n- Alex Sobel\n- Oct 19, 2018\n- 3 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nAs Hate Crime Awareness Week draws to a close, I have been reflecting on the impact hate crime has on our communities and how best we can challenge it.\nFigures show that 2201 hate crimes were recorded in West Yorkshire in 2015-16, compared to 5,223 for 2016-17. This year looks set to break that grim record again.\nLike most people, I am appalled that hate crime has more than doubled in the last five years, though I am not surprised. It is evident in my constituency casework, on my social media feeds and through the conversations I have with the police and other reporting organisations.\nThere is no singular contributor to hate crime, but there are powerful influences upon it. It is my view that elements of the media play a role in fostering intolerance, and I want to see a change in how things are done.\nIn a year when the press has turned its attention to the transgender community, it is no coincidence that reports of anti-transgender hate crime have risen by a third. Articles referring to transgender people as “zealots, destroying truth itself” (Mail on Sunday), falsely equating transgender women with drag queens (The Sun) and claiming children are being ‘brainwashed’ (Daily Mail) have been published, and the trans community have suffered as a result.\nWe cannot lay all the blame on the media, however. Politicians and other leading figures must also take responsibility for their words. When Boris Johnson compared women who wear a veil to “letterboxes”, Islamophobic attacks on Muslim women shot up as a direct result.\nWhat is more concerning is the recent attempt by reactionary politicians and commentators to dismiss these attacks as mere complaints by ‘the snowflakes’ or as ‘political correctness gone mad.’ The evidence increasingly shows an uptick in violent crime that is being legitimised by the rhetoric we are hearing from the media and political figures, not least the American President and Nigel Farage, who recently claimed his despicable ‘breaking point’ poster as a leading catalyst for the Leave campaign’s victory in the 2016 referendum.\nI am heartened though to see that there is push back both from organisations such as Hope Not Hate, of which I was once the chair, and also from the Crown Prosecution Service who have demonstrated the seriousness of which they take such crimes by applying sentence uplifts.\nAs a city, Leeds has also been praised for its work on tackling hate crime. We are home to Stop Hate UK, one of the leading national organisations working to challenge all forms of Hate Crime and discrimination and we also host wonderful events such as the ‘Great Get Together’, in memory of my colleague Jo Cox.\nIt is often said that hate is a manifestation of fear. And when we are swamped with scare stories from right wing websites and newspapers, designed to manipulate the genuine concerns for jobs and housing into fear of ‘the other’, it is easy to see how hate can take hold.\nIt is those people that it is possible to win back. As well as challenging and reporting it, we can all play an active role in stopping hate. Whether it is by putting out positive messages on social media or by getting involved in good old-fashioned community activism, it is up to all of us to create a better, more tolerant Britain.\nYou can report hate crime to the police by calling 101 (non-emergency) or 999 (emergency).\nStop Hate UK also provide confidential and independent Hate Crime reporting services in various areas in the UK including a 24 hour helpline.",

Some, like the ever earlier attempts to let out homes, rising rent in advance, and the need for guarantors, have become supercharged.\nLast year I attended an event organised by Leeds University Union where I heard from many students about these issues, especially guarantors and the expensive need for a guarantor service.\nAs a longstanding member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Students, I appreciate the crucial role in ensuring that the voices and needs of students are heard and represented in Parliament.\nIn the last Parliament, following meetings in student unions, the APPG meetings on\nstu- dent housing looked at the Renters’ Reform Bill and the issue of student housing more broadly.\nThese meetings highlighted the pressing need for fair and affordable housing for students, while a lightning rod issue was the struggle students face with the widespread practice of asking for rent up front and guarantors. What came out of the meetings and the National Union of Students’ work is just how discriminatory demands for rent up front and guarantors can be.\nStudents from deprived socio-economic backgrounds, those estranged from family, those who’ve come from care, and international students in particular, struggle to meet these requirements. These requirements also have an impact on their families. A guarantor is typically expected to be a parent or relative who owns property in the UK and/or earns a substantial income.\nSo, even if a student renter does manage to find someone suitable, the responsibility can be onerous. The guarantor has to pay the rent should a tenant default – but they can also be expected to pay for other costs, such as any damage. In a shared property, a guarantor can find themselves liable for damage caused by another tenant.\nIt is not uncommon for student renters to be asked for non-refundable holding fees while guarantors are vetted. For those who can’t secure a guarantor there are guarantor schemes, where private companies act as a guarantor for a tenant, but this is not a free ser- vice. What we see is that the most vulnerable renters are financially penalised.\nRent in advance is another common landlord ask, and one which often goes hand-in-hand with the demand for a guarantor – or be used where someone is not able to provide an approved guarantor. Students can be asked for six to 12 months’ rent upfront, a practice which is particularly common with international students.\nThe Renters’ Rights Bill (RRB) was a flawed piece of legislation, which did nothing to address these concerns. Labour’s new Renters’ Rights Bill is a vast improvement, and a huge opportunity to take action on rent upfront and guarantor requirements.\nThe cost-of-living crisis has had a devastating effect on students, as it has on many people, and there is evidence financial pressures are putting people off from studying. I hope my colleagues will give serious consideration to students’ arguments and help make the necessary changes to the Bill.",

In 2017, they recruited five more staff after winning a £2.5 million contract to supply North America. Weidmann’s now has plans to offer apprenticeships to school leavers in the local area but the Swiss owned paper-company is facing set backs due to Brexit.\nLeaving the EU could mean that the company will face complications in shipping their product through Dover. Since there is currently no tariff on paper trade, Weidmann’s will face most of their complications in securing the right workforce and machinery to continue supplying their products.\nThe company works closely with local businesses but relies on international trade for some of their specialist products. Weidmann Whiteley is the only paper-mill in the UK equipped to produce specialised paper board which is used as insulation in high power electrical transformers and in other industrial machinery. They trade internationally with several European countries to North America and New Zealand.\nMr Sobel said: “Weidmann’s is a very important business for the constituency. It is supporting schools and industry in Pool-in-Wharfedale and is one of the few industries in the area offering hands on experience for school leavers. It is a real shame that their international trade relationships could be at risk due to Brexit. Weidmann’s is a great example of a successful international business and it would be devastating to the area if jobs and trade were effected in the paper-making industry when we exit the EU next year.”\nManaging Director, John Briggs said: “We are pleased that Alex was able to come look around the site and find out about our community work and our support for apprenticeships, as well as recent initiatives which have opened up new export markets.

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_my-brexit-red-lines/content_230.html": "My Brexit Red Lines\n- Alex Sobel\n- Sep 13, 2017\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\n[This article was originally posted to the Leeds North West Labour Party website and republished here for reference]\nThe EU Withdrawal Bill is the first piece of legislation relating to the Brexit process to go before Parliament.\nWe know what is in it – it has already had its first token Parliamentary reading. And we know the direction of the Tories’ thinking – a White Paper published last March made that clear. The second reading in September will be a chance for the Tories to lay out details that are missing from the bill – and I’m waiting for the debate to see whether that will be the case.\nBut as it stands, it crosses many of my own red lines – as set out in a letter to constituents during the General Election campaign.\nUnless changes are made – and neither the Bill nor the White Paper indicate that will be the case – I will be unable to vote for the EU Withdrawal Bill, and will be compelled to vote against at Second Reading.\nIn my letter to constituents I made clear the three safeguards I consider essential in any Brexit process:\n1. Allowing EU Citizens already here to stay in the UK; 2. Protecting Workers Rights; 3. Securing Full Access to the Single Market.\nThese three safeguards have not changed, and nor has my position. I am working within Parliament to try and secure them. I am also deeply concerned about the environmental impact of Brexit.\nThe Bill as it stands does not protect these safeguards. So I have set out my main 5 red lines, which, if met, would allow the safeguards to remain in play in the negotiations. This doesn’t guarantee the safeguards, but it will mean they aren’t overridden before the negotiations even begin in earnest. These red lines in relation to the bill are set out below:\n1. The Bill does not guarantee any workers’, equality, environmental or similar rights which were not in UK law prior to our adoption of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (which is the document containing these fundamental rights) – and it does not contain any provision for us to keep pace with EU rights in these areas after Brexit.\nThese are rights for which we in the Labour Party have long fought. We cannot allow any possibility of their withdrawal through the back door.\n2. No right is worth more than the paper it is written on unless there are clear mechanisms to enforce it. My concerns are heightened by the lack of these in the Bill. Currently, we have the European Court of Justice and other European institutions to which citizens can go for redress. There are no equivalent UK institutions and no details in the Bill of what they will be. As it stands we have no idea how regulations will be policed after Brexit.\nBut the White Paper gives hints which are extremely worrying. Currently, firms must obtain the EU Commission’s opinion on environmental regulations when carrying out offshore oil and gas activities. The White paper proposes to allow delegated powers to ‘replace the reference to the Commission with a UK body [unspecified and undetailed] or remove this requirement completely.’ (White Paper, page 20)\nThis could mean much lower standards for offshore oil and gas, without effective enforcement.\n3. The Bill as it stands opens the way for different environmental, health and safety standards in the UK. This would prevent the free movement of goods and membership of the Customs Union or the Single Market since we need to have the same standards to ensure that goods can move seamlessly between countries.\nThe EU has the highest standards in the world in these areas. I’m committed to keeping these for the British people.\n4. There is a clear danger that ‘sunset clauses’ or other limitations or requirements could be inserted by the Government. If implemented, EU laws [and rights and standards] would be transferred into British law at first – but with a time limit.\nWhat happens when that time limit runs out? Would Parliament have a say or are we back to executive powers with Theresa May being the only voice that counts?\n5. Finally, I’m worried about the whole way the Government is proceeding here. There is too much talk about so-called ‘Henry VIII’ powers. These are far-reaching powers which would give government not Parliament the right to make changes and decisions on the details of new regulations and institutions.\nOnce given a carte blanche with the passing of the EU Withdrawal Bill, the government would have powers to change these very standards and rights which Brexit will put into question, without reference to Parliament.\nSo much for the Parliamentary sovereignty people who voted for Brexit wanted in June 2016!\nThe EU Withdrawal Bill is meant to bring certainty around our post-Brexit legislative framework. But as it appears at the moment, it just highlights the long list of things – across a whole range of areas – which demonstrate the scale of uncertainty involved in the UK’s proposed departure from the EU. The Bill lays bare the huge range of decisions that are required and the massive uncertainties that the Government will have to confront in less than 2 years.\nFar from bringing certainty, it just exposes the vast scale of uncertainty which we now face. The Government must bring forward a clear plan of how to deal with the establishment of UK new institutions, standards and regulations to ensure that the UK doesn’t go off a cliff edge.\nThe Bill as it stands is asking us to make a big leap into the unknown, trusting the Government to set up the forward framework with little oversight.\nUnless these 5 red lines for the Bill which I have laid out can be addressed clearly and comprehensively by the Government in September’s debate, I will be voting against the EU Withdrawal Bill at second reading.\n[This article was originally posted to the Leeds North West Labour Party website and republished here for reference]",

Cremations have reduced to a level which can ensure that the Council can put in place steps to protect the health of mourners. As per pre-coronavirus, service times will continue to be at most 40 minutes and to ensure that appropriate cleaning can take place between each funeral service, the Council has reduced the number of services per day to 9. The reduction will also ensure that the council is able to offer direct cremations along the same lines as pre-coronavirus.\nPublic Health England have published their guidance to ensure Councils conduct funerals safely. The key message throughout this guidance note is the importance of social distancing to prevent the risk of coronavirus. In line with this guidance, the council has taken the decision to restrict the largest number of mourners to 10 that chapels can allow inside.\nTo protect the health and well-being of all individuals in the chapel, LLC ask that mourners maintain social distancing at all times. Toilets and hand washing facilities will be available at each of the crematoria, aswell as hand sanitiser for mourners to use upon entering and exiting the chapel areas.\nLCC will ensure a thorough clean between each funeral service and that mourners do not overlap with the next funeral service coming in.\nLCC will be working with Funeral Directors to keep services in the chapel to the specified length of time. Due to the severe impact coronavirus continues to have on services in the city, bereavement service fees will remain at 2019 prices.\nTest, trace and isolate strategy\nLabour has always argued that the lockdown itself is not a strategy, and that the government need to build a strategy to control the virus. This is something that we need the government to succeed in this.\nEasing restrictions on the economy and reopening society will only work if there is an effective test, trace and isolate system in place. With the right system, we can avoid another damaging lockdown and reduce the risks to the public’s health as we open up our society.\nThe UK’s decision to abandon contact tracing on 12 March is one of the most serious mistakes of the crisis and we are still unsure if the government plans will be ready by 1 June as promised.\nThis is why Labour has set out a 10-point plan for an effective test, track and protect system. People are still anxious about the future, publishing a clear, detailed strategy is vital in restoring public confidence and keeping people safe.\nSerco data breach\nOutsourcing firm Serco have apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers.\nThe government’s contact tracing programme will rely on people having the confidence to pass on sensitive personal data. This data breach raises serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to do so.\nIt is concerning that the government has so far failed to publish any information about the contract it has awarded to Serco. The public will need far greater transparency if they are to have faith in the companies entrusted to deliver the government’s response to COVID.\nEnding rough sleeping\nCoronavirus is the biggest crisis our country has faced for a generation, but it has also presented us with a once in a generation opportunity: to help thousands of rough sleepers off the streets for good.\nThanks to the incredible work of local government, and dedicated funding, that opportunity is within our grasp. The government have committed to protecting vulnerable rough sleepers for the duration of the pandemic, but the dedicated funding to house rough sleepers is set to run out and so far the Government have published no clear plans for future funding, or put in place resources for what happens next.\nThe government needs to provide clarity on their ‘Everyone In’ policy. The policy must also include those made homeless during the coronavirus pandemic, without this we could see rough sleepers ending up back on the streets.\nWe also need to see policy changes for those with no recourse to public funds, and changes to Local Housing Allowance and Housing Benefit. These changes will enable us to help rough sleepers move into longer-term accommodation.\nBank Holiday Weekend\nI understand that the weather forecast for the Bank Holiday weekend is going to be reasonably good, but please remember that although we have had an easing of lockdown measures we still must Stay at home as much as possible, ensure that we social distance at least 2 metres away from other people whilst out and only meet 1 family member or friend from another household in a park and maintain social distancing with them.\nI fully appreciate as time goes on lockdown becomes harder and more tiresome for a lot of people, but if we ignore the measures now we risk undoing all the hard work that’s already been done and could see a rise in the ‘R’ number and even a second wave of the virus.\nPlease Stay home, Protect the NHS and Save Lives.\n‘Ask Alex’\nJoin me tomorrow on Facebook Live at 2pm, where I will be discussing the latest information on coronavirus, and answering any related questions you may have.\nFollow my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/AlexSobelForLeedsNorthWest/ to participate and keep up to date with my activities both at home and in Parliament.",

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_summary-of-covid-19-measures-and-why-they-are-in-place/content_399.html": "Summary of Covid 19 measures and why they are in place\n- Alex Sobel\n- Sep 22, 2020\n- 3 min read\nUpdated: Jul 24, 2023\nBelow is a summary of the current situation regarding coronavirus and is correct as of 5pm on the 22nd September 2020.\nWhat is happening?\nProfessor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance yesterday took to the airways as leading scientists advising the Government as to the latest situation regarding coronavirus. Cases are now roughly doubling every seven days. This means by mid-October we could expect to have around 50k cases in the UK per day. Starkly, this could mean that we are looking at a death toll in mid-November of 200 deaths per day.\nPeople have contacted me a lot to ask why, if Covid is returning, are the death rates not yet increasing significantly? Is it, they wonder, due to either coronavirus getting weaker, some kind of herd immunity or are we just simply testing more and this is throwing our results off?\nSadly, the answer to all these questions is no.\nAs the scientists said yesterday, there is no evidence that the virus is weakening. Positive cases are rising as a percentage of tests done. This means that the rise is irrespective of the number of tests being completed. Studies suggest that only around 8% of the population have had it and therefore carry some immunity (though this can fade over time) which leaves 92% of us as vulnerable as we ever were. It is likely that the reason for hospital admissions staying relatively low, is that the spikes have been so far within the younger population 20-29 and then 30-39.\nBut it is clear from the data that cases in all age groups are now rising significantly and whilst hospital admissions are low now, this will not hold if we stay on the current course.\nWhat measures have been announced\nThe Government have announced today the following:\nIn England, a maximum of six people from multiple households can meet up both indoors and outdoors. All ages are included in the headcount. There are some exceptions (e.g if a single household has more than six occupants.) The distance is listed now as 1 metre plus.\nThere can be multiple groups of six people in a place, provided that those groups do not mingle. If you are at a restaurant for example you should avoid mingling with anyone outside the group you are with, even if you see other people you know. People attending a protest, or other organised event, should also attend in groups no larger than six.\nOffice based staff are being asked to work from home where they can.\nPubs and Restaurants have now a curfew of 22:00\nExceptions include places of worship (provided they are Covid-secure) and organised sport (provided they are paying attention to the specific guidelines)\nWe can expect these rules to last for the next six months.\nI am concerned that this might not be enough to stem the spread and avoid unnecessary deaths so am keeping a watching brief.\nOther important messages\nContinue with existing measures such as keeping a safe social distance, washing your hands and wearing masks in public indoor spaces. Please keep social gatherings to a minimum where you can.\nIf you have symptoms get a test. You can book a test online or by calling 119.\nIt can be frustrating to see the rules applied differently in different settings and I have had many people raise this with me. Whilst it is tempting to think ‘if strangers can be together in a bar then why shouldn’t I…’ we should try to remember that reducing risk is different from removing risk. Therefore, we should congratulate ourselves on following the guidelines and reducing the risk to ourselves and others.\nProfessor Whitty and Sir Vallance were clear that there is no such thing as individual risk. The risks we take impact on other people. If we catch the virus, we are very likely to pass it onto others before we even know we have contracted it.\nWhat can you expect from me\nMy Office will be available to contact and my staff will be operating from home. As such our phones will be re-routed and answered by staff at their homes. We are expecting a large increase in cases again as these measures are introduced and as a new Covid spike occurs so please can you contact the office via email wherever you can (alex@alexsobel.co.uk) and keep your queries short and specific. Please also include your address and whether or not you would like to receive a reply.\nI am conducting constituency surgeries for specific individual casework and I am doing these online and over the telephone. For more general policy enquiries I do Ask Alex every other Saturday at 2pm on Facebook Live.",

In a debate in Westminster Hall he said:\n“We have the infrastructure, we have Sky, we have Perform and we have Yorkshire TV. We have Rockstar Leeds.(…) We have Pace and ARRIS in Saltaire, which power internet and TV for hundreds of millions of people globally. We have the people and we have the infrastructure.”\nJohn Grogan, MP for Keighley argued that Leeds City Region that the UK media should beware of only locating in big cities in the west of the country. He said:\n“Although people say that their cities are like Channel 4, we have learned politically over the last few years that the United Kingdom is not just about cities. That is one of the strengths of the Leeds city region’s bid. Public investment in television in England and Wales over the last 30 or 40 years has all been in the west of the nation. There is a big gap in the east of the country where there has been no big investment in television and film.\nJudith Blake, Leader of Leeds City Council said:\n“Leeds’s thriving culture, leading universities and diverse geography makes the city region a perfect choice for channel 4’s relocation. I am confident that our bid will be a strong contender for the move which will bring jobs and opportunities, allowing us to keep our talent here and further enhance our local economy.”",
  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_my-statement-on-the-murder-of-george-floyd/content_516.html": "My statement on the murder of George Floyd\n- Alex Sobel\n- Jun 4, 2020\n- 3 min read\nUpdated: Jul 26, 2023\nThe murder of George Floyd is not just an isolated tragedy but a symptom of the systemic racism which has plagued the Americas since Europeans first landed on its shores. It found its height in the United States during the period of slavery but despite the gains made since then, this legacy still persists. My solidarity is with the Black Lives Matter movement and with all those in the struggle for racial justice in America. That is why I wrote to the Trade Secretary calling for the suspension of sales of british made riot gear to the US.\nThe historic underinvestment in black communities, educational inequality, lack of opportunities and over reliance on state funding for law enforcement and the military needs to be rebalanced. Funding must be redistributed to communities to improve housing, education and jobs. The US police can afford tanks and water cannons, but youth projects have leaky roofs and schools in black neighbourhoods lack teachers and supplies. As someone who has campaigned in the US and been involved in Community Organising there, I have seen this inequality firsthand.\nHowever, whilst there is a tendency to focus on the failings of the US when it comes to addressing anti-blackness within social and legal institutions, we must never forget the racism that also pervades British society. Police brutality and racial profiling are not just an American problem and neither is the systemic oppression of Black people in general.\nJust two months ago, transport worker Belly Mujinga died after being spat on whilst at work, despite suffering with a respiratory condition that should have prevented her from interacting physically with customers at all. We know that people of colour are far more likely to die of COVID-19 as the recent government report confirms and Belly Mujinga’s case highlights the brutal reality of this fact. The report, which the government dragged its feet over releasing, also fails to offer any reasons why this inequality exists or how to remedy it: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/censorship-row-over-report-on-uk-bame-covid-19-deaths\nWe know the Tories are not serious about racial justice. The Prime Minister himself has made many casually racist remarks during his career, and in the ten years since they have been in power they have presided over a hostile environment which has victimised and deported British people of colour, many of whom disproportionately staff our crucial public services. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Johnson didn’t mention George Floyd, Belly Mujinga or Black Lives Matter until Keir Starmer raised it and forced him into a position where he had to weakly respond that ‘of course Black Lives Matter’.\nWe need greater focus on racial justice in our schools and our national curriculum. I have written to the Education Secretary to ask him to ensure that racial justice and Britain’s part in the subjugation of people of colour be taught in schools. I have also written to the Home office to ask the Home Secretary what steps she is taking to address the racism in Britain’s policing system and the Foreign Secretary to ask him to at least make a statement on the crisis.\nI am proud to have campaigned against racism since my teen years and well before I was a member of the Labour Party. I started out protesting outside Neo-Nazi gatherings and then worked on the family campaigns around racist murders and deaths in police custody. This culminated in being called as a witness in the McPherson inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. I assure you that you have an ally and an advocate in Parliament on this profoundly important issue and that I was stirred to action before a single email from a constituent was received.\nI have included some useful links below for things you can do to support the movement for racial justice both here and in the US.\nI will keep fighting and you should too.\nFundraiser for the family of Belly Mujinga:\nFundraiser for Black Lives Matter UK:\nDonate to support The Black Curriculum:\nPetition demanding the Government cease sales of riot gear to the US:\nArticle with more useful ways to support:\nA survey for BAME people from the TUC:",

The run also means a unique drinking culture in Headingley, with the presence of waves of intoxicated groups from much earlier in the day. That means that the relatively early closing time of 11pm (compared with much later in the city centre branches) is unlikely to stave off anti-social behaviour and congregations of intoxicated individuals on the footpath.\n2) Headingley centre does not fit the profile of any other Leeds Mcdonald’s restaurant. Notwithstanding the city centre, the other outlets are either situated within retail parks or superstores (Owlcoates Shopping Centre, Asda Pudsey Superstore, West Side Retail Park, Business Park Centre 27, Cardigan Fields Leisure Park, White Rose Shopping Centre, Acorn Business Centre, Colton Retail Park) or off major four lane highways (Ring Road/ Butt Lane, Ring Road West Park, Elland Road M621, Dewsbury Road Morley, Easterly Road). These outlets all have ample parking and are well away from dense residential populations. There are no Mcdonald’s currently in any Leeds ‘village’ high street.\n3) Headingley Lane into Otley Road suffers from serious congestion problems, with northbound traffic often backed up from 3pm onwards and can reach as far back as Hyde Park corner, 1km away. These long-established problems would only be exacerbated with a Mcdonald’s take away outlet being situated right at the point of the bottleneck.\n4) There are no plans for onsite parking within the application. There are limited parking spaces within Headingley Centre and whilst there are parking restrictions within residential streets, there is currently little capacity to enforce illegal parking on the scale that a Mcdonald’s take away would bring. Whilst I applaud the outlets commitment to providing for cycling customers, the idea that this will be the main mode of transport used to reach the restaurant is fanciful.\n5) There is no current need for another fast-food outlet within Headingley. There are currently several other fast-food chains within the nearby Arndale Centre which amply provides for the market and provides indoor seating. These include KFC, Nando’s and will soon include Burger King. Independent take away outlets such as I Am Doner, currently situated just over the road from the new site would be heavily impacted. McDonald’s already have a site in Lawnswood.\n6) Mcdonald’s has a reputation for antisocial behaviour and fights particularly during late opening hours, with many having to employ door staff. Whilst the application currently states that the restaurant will close at 11pm, the specific drinking culture outlined in 1, would provide fertile ground for this behaviour much earlier in the day.\n7) Whilst I am sure the intention is for customers to take their food well away from the premises, the likely outcome will be congregations of people on the narrow footpaths. This would be a danger both to passing pedestrians and to the customers themselves given the proximity to the road.\n8) Litter is already a problem in our area, and the increased food litter associated with a new Mcdonald’s would have a detrimental impact on the local environment for residents and businesses. There is not enough street space for additional bins of the capacity needed, without impeding on pedestrians.",

She joined him at his constituency coffee morning in Yeadon and also took part in his regular online Q an A ‘Ask Alex,’ where she fielded public questions about her campaign priorities.\nLois is passionate about reducing plastic in the world’s oceans and has made reducing Leeds’ plastic footprint a cornerstone of her campaign. She shares this passion with her local MP who has spent much of his first year campaigning on the issue and has even partaken in a plastic- free week.\nLois said: ““it was really fun doing the Facebook Live Q&A session with Alex Sobel. It’s so great to have his support because he knows so much. His tips and advice have been a huge help in my campaign to become Leeds Children’s Mayor.\nIt’s really hard to campaign across the summer holidays as lots of people, including me, are away. Social media has helped with this. Hopefully adults who see ‘Ask Alex’ will show their children and encourage them to vote (before the deadline of 19th September). I’ll be visiting lots of schools in September too. I really hope that people feel as passionate about this subject as I am, then we can make a real difference to our beautiful planet.”\nLois’ mum Anne Priestley said “I’m so proud of Lois. I didn’t even know she’d put forward for Leeds Children’s Mayor until I heard she’d got into the final! Lois loved watching David Attenborough’s Blue Planet programmes and they have had a huge influence on her wanting to reduce the amount of plastic being used in schools in Leeds.\nShe wants to get the message out to as many people as possible, so the support from Alex Sobel is fantastic. He has a lot of experience in this subject, and he knows that Lois wants to make a difference to plastic pollution in Leeds, even if she doesn’t quite make it to Children’s Mayor...but obviously, we all hope she does!”\nAlex said: “ It was a great pleasure to meet Lois and hear about all of her fantastic ideas for our city. I was inspired to meet such an enthusiastic and driven young person who is determined to make the world a better place. The future is bright with young people like Lois.”",

Mr Sobel went on to say \"We will be the biggest council in the country to have declared a climate emergency. Nearly 800,000 people live in our great city.”\nAlso speaking at the event was Alex’s son Jakob, aged 11. He said that he believed climate change should be taught in schools.\nPolice reported that the numbers of young people and their supporters were four times more than expected on Friday, as concerned young people flocked to Leeds from all over West Yorkshire.\nElliot Nathan, Otley and Yeadon Labour candidate for the forthcoming Leeds City Council elections, spent his lunch hour supporting the protest.\n“I felt that I had to come out to show my support for these young people, who have decided that they can no longer leave it to the older generation to act as we drift towards climate catastrophe\" said Mr Nathan. \" If we are to protect our planet, and all the diverse flora and fauna who depend on it - including ourselves - government must act now.\"\n\"If elected in May, I want to be part of Leeds City Council’s ongoing work to radically reduce the carbon footprint of our area, and it’s up to all of us as individuals to think about the choices we make.”",

Alex has had several public meetings where residents have put their concerns directly to First and has brought constituents up to the depot to raise their issues directly with company bosses.\nAlex said “I am delighted that so many people came to the event and the positive and constructive atmosphere that was created in the room.

We could get to Housean Gorge cheaply, quickly and easily. I was very impressed by the spirit and positive atmosphere and the friendly, professional staff who joined us on board. Not only does this service benefit those without access to a car, but traveling to the Dales on the bus brings its own benefits – it allows you to sit back and enjoy the journey through some of the most breathtaking countryside in England, plan walks that do not have to circulate back to a car and travel cheaply with great benefit to the environment. I hope people continue to use this service throughout the season and I look forward to a continuing relationship with Friends of Dales Bus where we can ensure that many more people get access to this wonderful natural asset right on our doorstep.”\nColin Speakman, Vice Chair of Friends of Dales Bus and leading author on the Yorkshire Dales said: “I am delighted to see the effort and hard work of so many committed volunteers pay off. The bus launch was a great success and we are pleased that so many people are hearing about our routes and are coming along to try it for themselves.\nOur aim is simple: to give easy and affordable access to the outstanding natural beauty of Nidderdale. I am so pleased that Alex Sobel and his family came to spend the day with us and enjoy our bus routes, our cause is close to his heart and we look forward to working with him as well as John Grogan, who has been a great advocate for our cause, to ensure the future and push for meaningful legislative change that will ensure the future of our project and projects like it nationwide.”\nJohn Grogan MP for Keighley said:\n“Otley bus station is now a hub for DalesBus and particuarly just before 10am on Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays in the summer no less than 3 buses are heading off into the Yorkshire countryside.\nPassengers from Keighley can continue on the new service which starts from the town’s bus station directly into Nidderdale or switch on to a bus for Grasdington , Kettlewell and Malham. I am only sorry that the Yorkshire Dales National Parks Authority did not provide any funding for DalesBus in 2017/2018.

  "https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_/https_www_alexsobel_co_uk_post_proposed-welfare-changes/content_9.html": "Proposed Welfare Changes\n- Alex Sobel\n- Mar 25\n- 5 min read\nMy Response and How You Can Have Your Say\nThe Government recently announced their Green Paper on welfare reform.\nGreen Papers are consultation documents designed to gather feedback from both Parliament and the public on proposed policies and legislation. I have been carefully reviewing these proposals. Given the complexity and depth of the proposals, I encourage you to read them in full here: https://tinyurl.com/PWTWproposals.\nHowever, I want to address some of the key issues that many of you have raised with me and that have been widely discussed in the media.\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP)\nIn Leeds Central and Headingley, 4,599 constituents currently receive PIP. At the time of the 2021 census, 17,033 people in Leeds Central and Headingley - 16% of my constituency - were classed as disabled. This means that only just over a quarter of disabled people in my constituency are claiming PIP.\nIn my constituency, the most common reason for claims is psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety and depression. The DWP also includes learning disabilities and autism in this category. Psychiatric illnesses account for 45% of claimants in my constituency, significantly higher than the national average of 38%.\nEnsuring that our welfare system works for everyone who needs it is a top priority for me.\nThe Prime Minister is right to acknowledge the need for welfare reform, including changes to PIP. However, reform should not begin with cutting billions of pounds in support for society’s most vulnerable. Moving the goalposts for PIP eligibility will not help or encourage people into work.\nPIP is a modest but vital payment designed to help with the added costs of living with a disability, covering essential daily activities and mobility. The Government’s proposal to cut PIP funding by £5 billion is not a strategy for employment—it is a direct reduction in support for disabled people, regardless of their ability to work. In fact, restricting financial help may make it even harder for those who can work to do so.\nLimiting access to PIP will shift the burden onto already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care, and local government—services that have already endured 14 years of austerity.\nOne of the most concerning aspects of the proposals is the plan to change PIP’s eligibility criteria by increasing the threshold.\nCurrently, PIP applicants are assessed on two areas: daily living and mobility, with the daily living element covering twelve activities, for example preparing food. To receive the lower rate of PIP, applicants need to score at least eight points in total across any of these activities. This means someone could qualify even if they scored, for example, two points in four of the activities.\nUnder the Government’s proposals, applicants would need to score at least four points in a single activity to qualify, as well as at least eight points in total across the range of activities.\nWithout a corresponding review of the assessment descriptors, this change could exclude many disabled people with significant needs. For instance, individuals who need home dialysis or need help with basic daily tasks such as washing and dressing could lose crucial financial support. A fair and comprehensive reassessment of eligibility criteria is essential. Since being elected I have always maintained that PIP assessments should be completed by someone who knows the person or their specific condition - a GP, Consultant or specialist.\nSome aspects of the proposals are more welcome, including:\nThe introduction of recorded PIP assessments as standard.\nAn overhaul of safeguarding policies to improve training and ensure vulnerable people are protected.\nCollaboration with disabled people and advocacy groups to improve the assessment process.\nEnding repeated reassessments for people with lifelong, severe conditions.\nNo changes to the Mobility component\nHowever, concerns do remain, including the increase in face-to-face assessments, which could place undue stress on claimants. I understand that there are mixed feelings about this, and have spoken to some applicants who feel positively about face-to-face assessments but many who feel it would add barriers to accessing PIP.\nThe proposals do suggest that we continue to meet the needs of people who are claiming, who may require a different method of assessment, however we must ensure that additional barriers are not created during this process.\nThe current system is already complex, with lengthy delays, inconsistent decision-making, and widespread distrust. Any reforms must address these systemic issues rather than worsening them.\nUniversal Credit and Work Capability Assessment\nThere are several key changes proposed to Universal Credit:\nThe standard allowance will be increased above inflation for the first time ever, equating to an annual rise of £775 for claimants by 2029/30.\nThe Work Capability Assessment (WCA), which decides eligibility for incapacity benefits, will be scrapped in 2028. This assessment has long been criticised for forcing people into rigid, binary categories—either “fit to work” or “unable to work”—without considering the complexities of fluctuating health conditions.\nInstead, disability benefits assessments will rely solely on the PIP system. For those who are eligible for PIP this simplifies the process. However, for those who are not eligible for PIP but who are currently in the LCWRA group of Universal Credit, this means they could lose out on their Universal Credit top up.\nHowever, the Government is considering how any change of this kind could affect individuals who currently meet limited capability for work and work-related activity (LCWRA) criteria due to conditions that are not expected to be lifelong. For example, those affected by cancer treatment, people with short term conditions that get better, women with a high-risk pregnancy and those currently classed as having substantial risk.\nThe Government is introducing measures to reassure claimants that trying to work will not automatically trigger a reassessment or loss of benefits. This is a key step in reducing the fear many disabled people have about re-entering employment.\nA new premium will be introduced for claimants with severe, lifelong conditions that will not improve.\nHowever, under the new rules, claimants under 22 will no longer be eligible for the incapacity benefit top-up within Universal Credit. This may create a two-tier system of disability support based on age and given that my constituency is one of the youngest in the UK with 41% of constituents in my constituency being aged 18-24, I am particularly concerned about this.\nAfter 14 years of Conservative-led government, trust in the welfare system—particularly disability benefits—has been severely eroded. I understand why these proposals are being met with apprehension, and in some cases, fear. While some of the proposed changes could simplify the system, others risk making life even harder for those who rely on this support.\nHave Your Say\nI strongly encourage you to participate in the Government’s public consultation and share your views on these proposed changes. I understand there is concern about the limited scope of the questions, but you are able to raise further issues about any of the proposals via the email address provided.\nFurthermore, as your representative, I want to hear directly from you so I have created a survey where you can highlight any specific challenges these changes may pose for you, your loved ones, or those you care for, and I can use this to lobby the Government on your behalf.\nGovernment Consultation: https://tinyurl.com/PWTWconsultation\nMy constituency Survey: https://tinyurl.com/alexsobelsurvey\nIn addition to gathering feedback from constituents, I am actively engaging with benefits advisors, disability rights organisations, and other key stakeholders to understand their perspectives. Your input will be invaluable as I raise concerns with DWP Ministers.\nThere is no place in the UK for a welfare system that discriminates against the most vulnerable. I will continue to fight for a system that provides fair, compassionate, and effective support.",

The Tap room was opened back in September of this year, but the microbrewery was established over 2 years ago.\nAlex said, “I was delighted to visit the Tap Room to see and discuss this new venture, including the hardships facing hospitality and brewing at the moment.”\n“We were also joined by representatives of Meanwood Brewery and CAMRA and discussed how the industry is recovering since re-opening after the lockdowns and how the industry can be helped more by the Government to ensure these small businesses survive.\nOne of the issues raised was the Relief on Draught Beer, the keg size for qualifying for relief is set at 40 litres and therefore small brewers cannot benefit from the relief as they use 20 or 30 litre kegs. I have written on their behalf to the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to ask for him to reconsider the requirement size of the Kegs to enable small brewers to benefit from the relief.”\nAlex went on to say “It’s really encouraging given the damage caused by the Pandemic to businesses and the economy that there are new ventures in Otley. I wish both Hug on a Tray and Shadow Brewing continued success”",
