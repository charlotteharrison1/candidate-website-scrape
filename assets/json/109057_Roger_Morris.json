But it also highlighted how fly-tipping, safety concerns, and bins left on pavements 🗑️ are making things worse for residents.\nWe also spoke about Cheshire East Council’s plans to introduce fines 💷 under a borough-wide Section 46 notice. This means residents could face Fixed Penalty Notices for leaving bins out too early or too late. I don’t want to see any of our residents fined – I want to work with the community to fix these issues together 🤝.\nIt’s always encouraging to meet residents who genuinely care about their street and want to make a difference 💪.

This comes just days after the play equipment was destroyed by fire.\n🪑 And just outside the park, benches surrounded by empty cans—with bins only metres away—show a complete lack of respect for our community spaces.\nI’ll be: 🔍 Asking for the new CCTV to be checked\n🔧 Requesting a full clean-up and repairs\n🛑 And pushing for more to be done to prevent this kind of behaviour in the first place\nThis isn’t just about fixing damage after the fact. We have to ask why it keeps happening and what more we can do to prevent it. These are supposed to be safe spaces for families and little ones to enjoy. If you’ve seen anything whether it’s the vandalism, the fire, or even who dumped the paint please report it to Cheshire Police on 101 or anonymously to Crimestoppers.\nWe all want better for our area, and I’ll keep pushing until we get it.\nSo let’s all stand up for our parks, before we lose them altogether.\n#CreweCentral #DerbyStreet #ProtectOurParks #AntiSocialBehaviour #StopTheVandalism #CommunityFirst #RespectOurSpaces #CreweDeservesBetter #ForOurChildren #CleanUpCrewe\nHere in Oxford Street as I often get reports of fly tipping in this spot next to bins being left out. You can see from the video on a windy day like today bins have been blown over or lids blown open and rubbish blown around the street. In the future the council is looking to take enforcement action for bins left out unnecessarily and I want to avoid any of my residents getting these fines. Please remember to put your bins away and only have them out the day they should be emptied\nSpoken to a number of concenred residents in Bright Street park about the proposed new park entrance. Residents are quite rightly concerned that it would attract anti social behaviour outside their homes. Residents have proposed to Ansa an alternative entrance area of Richard Moon Street which I will be following up in the coming days",
