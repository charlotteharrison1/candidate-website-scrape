This change involves making the allowance more targeted, so it only goes to those in receipt of pension credits.\nThis was not a decision I took lightly and I know not everyone is happy with it. I want to explain my thinking.\nThere were two key questions which I have particularly reflected upon prior to this vote:\nMy belief is that the pension credit is a fair threshold to stop this happening. But the key thing is that everyone eligible is receiving it. There are reportedly 880,000 people entitled but not claiming – which not only means they will not get the Winter Fuel Allowance, but they will not get the pension credit itself or get other things, like discounts on council tax. The government is also extending the Household Support Fund for the next 6 months because it is a lifeline for people who are struggling with the cost of living. MPs like myself have a role to play in raising awareness of these things. You can write to my office if you are in need of help checking eligibility with either: [email protected]\nOn this question I look to some of the other things going on at the level of national government. The energy price cap will be £117 lower at the end of this year than in 2023. The state pension went up £900 in April (much faster than working-age benefits). The triple-lock is in place and Labour are 100% committed to it. So I am satisfied that the Winter Fuel Allowance changes, difficult as they are, are offset by significant other forms of pensioner support.\nClearly in an ideal world a Labour government would not be making this change. We introduced the Winter Fuel Allowance in the first place, in 1997.\nHowever, the legacy we were left by the last government means hard choices are needed. The money needed to fill the £22bn black hole which Chancellor Rachel Reeves has identified will need to come from somewhere.\nThe alternative, if we bury our heads in the sand, is that we potentially see a collapse of confidence in the UK economy, across markets. The deficit could grow dramatically. Growth could slow further and public services become even more stretched.\nI do not see this as viable.\nThe question then becomes not ‘if’ we fill the black hole, but ‘how’. Being in government is, in the end, about being the one who makes this choice. And already some of the easier options – from taxing energy giants to removing non-dom status – have been deployed.\nRegardless of the rationale, I can understand that any change to the Winter Fuel Allowance will feel worrying, given that it is for pensioners. Anyone who has an older relative can identify with this – particularly with the nights drawing in.\nSo I think we need to be really clear that this policy is about means testing the allowance – not abolishing it. It removes the ‘universal’ element, which currently means the allowance is paid regardless of how much money and assets pensioners have.\nThis is still not ideal, at a time when everyone is feeling the pinch. But I believe it is justifiable, with public finances and services as stretched as they are.\nKeir Starmer said recently that things may get worse before they get better. This is obviously not the news we wanted to hear. But it indicates both an honesty and a focus on the long-term which I believe is refreshing in politics, given what we have witnessed these past few years.\nI therefore see the Winter Fuel Allowance changes, whilst not something anyone wanted to have to do, as a decision for the long term. This is about taking immediate action to steady the economy and turn around the tanker. It is not a decision taken in isolation. Is a prerequisite to the steps which are clearly needed for the future of country – to rebuild public services and get our economy growing.\nThis is how I viewed the decisions the government took, and this is why I voted the way I did.\nBayo Alaba\nMP for Southend East and Rochford",

ATF creates positive pathways for engagement through sport, catering to a diverse range of groups, including offenders, young families, and individuals learning English as a second language. Their work is vital in fostering inclusivity and community spirit.\nDuring my visit, I was delighted to meet the dedicated ATF team. Their commitment to empowering individuals and creating opportunities for engagement through sport is truly commendable. As your MP, I am eager to support their initiatives and amplify their message.\nI later referenced this important work in my speech in the House of Commons, highlighting ATF’s significant strides in my constituency of Southend East and beyond. Their grassroots efforts utilise sport as a powerful tool to heal and unite communities, particularly among those at risk of exclusion. I discussed the transformative potential of sport, especially for individuals who have encountered challenges within the criminal justice system. Since my election, we have seen multiple incidents of knife crime and anti-social behaviour in our community, which can have frightening and potentially fatal consequences.\nSport often serves as a critical intervention point for young people, equipping them with essential life skills such as determination, teamwork, and resilience. It provides an opportunity for youth to reconnect with their communities and build positive relationships.\nDrawing on my own experiences as an amateur football manager, I shared how I witnessed the impact of grassroots sports firsthand. As part of a leadership team in one of Europe’s largest amateur football clubs, we nurtured young talent from our community. Many of these young players faced significant challenges and were often drawn into negative influences. The support and camaraderie found in a football team not only shaped their lives but also provided a positive and encouraging environment.\nIt is an honour to pay tribute to the success of ATF and to emphasise the importance of local grassroots organisations that use sport to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour. These organisations offer young people a second chance, allowing them to rebuild their lives and contribute positively to society.\nThank you for your continued support in recognising the vital role of community engagement through sport. Together, we can ensure that organisations like ATF continue to thrive and make a positive impact in our communities.",

  "https_bayoalaba_com/https_bayoalaba_com_securing-the-future-of-council-housing-a-call-to-action/content_10.html": "Previous article\nI recently attended the launch of an important report, Securing the Future of Council Housing, which outlines a vision to protect and revitalise council housing across the country. As an MP, council housing is an issue that I am deeply committed to supporting because I believe that everyone deserves a safe and comfortable place to call home. For over a century, council homes have provided that foundation for millions of families, but today, we face significant challenges that demand urgent action.\nThe need for truly affordable and secure housing has never been more critical. Currently, a record 109,000 households in England live in temporary accommodation, highlighting the dire shortage of council housing. This lack of supply is straining government finances as well—between 2021 and 2026, private landlords are set to receive £70 billion in housing benefits due to the shortfall of affordable options.\nIn response to this crisis, twenty of England’s largest council landlords released an interim report earlier this year with recommendations for the new government. Encouragingly, the Deputy Prime Minister has since pledged a ‘council housing revolution,’ promising new investment, rent stability, and a review of Right to Buy policies. However, while these announcements are welcome, much more needs to be done to secure a sustainable future for council housing.\nThe financial model underpinning council housing is broken, with a projected £2.2 billion deficit in councils’ housing budgets by 2028. This is largely due to the failure to uphold a 2012 agreement between the government and councils. While councils were expected to deliver on their commitments, repeated changes in central government policies have imposed new costs and restrictions, making it increasingly difficult for councils to meet their obligations.\nThe Housing Revenue Account (HRA) system is now in a precarious state, and a simple rent settlement will not be enough to fix it. Without immediate intervention to stabilise its foundations, many council landlords will struggle to maintain existing homes, meet new safety and energy standards, or build new social housing. Instead, some councils may be forced to sell off their remaining stock, further reducing the availability of council homes.\nThe report offers a comprehensive, practical plan for how councils can work with the government over the next decade to safeguard the future of council housing. It calls for urgent steps to stabilise the system, including a £644 million emergency capital injection to offset income lost due to recent rent caps. This funding would provide short-term relief, allowing councils to continue investing in housing maintenance and development.\nLooking ahead, the report proposes key measures for the next government spending review:\nThese recommendations lay out a bold yet achievable path to stabilise the council housing system, improve living conditions, and build the next generation of council homes. As an MP, I am committed to advocating for these changes and working closely with the government to ensure that our communities have the housing they deserve.\nThe future of council housing is at a critical juncture, but with the right support and decisive action, we can restore stability to the system and provide a secure, affordable home for every family that needs one. I look forward to working together with local authorities, council landlords, and the government to make this vision a reality. It’s time to secure the future of council housing for the benefit of all.\nIf you care about the future of council housing and want to understand the full scope of the challenges and solutions, I encourage you to read the full report. It offers a detailed roadmap for how we can work together to ensure every family has a safe, secure home. You can access the report here: Read the report. Let’s join forces to advocate for the changes our communities need.",

Over the past few weeks, I have been holding a series of street meetings focused on how we can reduce and ultimately stop crime within our area. These meetings provide a unique format that fosters community engagement and allows residents to voice their concerns directly.\nRecently, I hosted a community meeting on the High Street in Shoebury, near the picturesque East Beach. This gathering brought together not only residents but also representatives from Essex Police – Southend District, safety teams from Southend-on-Sea City Council, and members of the East Beach and Shoebury Residents’ Associations. The collaborative atmosphere underscored our collective commitment to addressing the pressing safety concerns that affect our daily lives.\nOne of the most encouraging aspects of these meetings is the strong turnout from community members. It’s inspiring to see so many people come together, ready to discuss their experiences and seek solutions. In Shoebury, residents had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the agencies responsible for their safety, fostering a sense of openness and accountability that is crucial for effective community policing.\nDuring our discussions, key issues such as speeding vehicles, drug dealing, and antisocial behaviour were front and centre. These challenges can significantly impact our quality of life, making our streets feel unsafe. It’s vital that everyone in our community feels secure while walking through their neighbourhoods. Equally important is the need for accountability for those who commit crimes.\nIn addition to the meeting in Shoebury, I recently held another street meeting in Westcliff, prompted by several high-profile instances of violent crime and antisocial behaviour in the Claremont Close area over the summer. Alongside the community safety team at Southend-on-Sea City Council and Cllr Mandy O’Connor, we sought to hear firsthand from residents about their experiences. My caseworkers were also present to address specific concerns, ensuring that every voice was heard.\nThese street meetings are not just about discussing problems; they are about empowering the community and fostering collaboration. They give me, as your MP, the chance to hear directly from constituents about the issues that matter most to you. Your insights are invaluable, and they guide our collective efforts to find effective solutions.\nI encourage everyone to participate in these discussions as I continue to hold more street meetings in various locations across our constituency. Your voice matters, and I am here to listen and take action. If you have concerns about crime in areas like Hamlet Court Road, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me and my team at [email protected].\nTogether, we can work towards creating a safer environment for all. Thank you to everyone who has attended these meetings and contributed to this important dialogue. Let’s continue collaborating to make our community a place where everyone feels safe and secure.",

  "https_bayoalaba_com/https_bayoalaba_com/content_1.html": "Introduction\nAs your MP, I am focused squarely on fulfilling the potential of Southend and banging the drum, through creating a stronger economic centre of gravity for the city and a ‘year-round’ economy to keep talented young people here. At the constituency level my aim is to be as visible and responsive an MP as possible. I’ll work across the whole of the seat, and roll my sleaves up to tackle casework.\nWhat I stand for\nEconomic regeneration that enables our young people to stay local is key to Southend East and Rochford’s future. Young people need to have access to decent paid work locally to negate the need to leave the area after their studies have completed. Our young should be able to lay their ‘anchor’ where they grew up!\nPutting Southend back on the map is my aim for Southend East and Rochford. Our high streets across the constituency have a rich history, which will help us create its future. Support for new, small, and medium businesses, as well as startups, to find a home in the constituency is a core aim of mine.\nCouncil housing revolution for current and future generations of Southend East and Rochford is paramount. I stand for grandparents seeing their children and grandchildren regularly because they have access to nearby, affordable local/affordable housing. Supporting these new developments will be a focus on local infrastructure (GP Surgeries, medical centres, parking, roads, and schools), to ensure new and existing developments are sustainable.\nCreating green jobs through labours Green New Deal. Working with landowners, Essex, Rochford, and Southend Councils, I will help steer our community towards new industries. Whether it be the relocating of existing business or supporting local SME’s and start up’s, this community will strive to be the epicentre of Labours, and the countries, green Industry plans.\nCelebrating our tourism heritage and culture, whilst protecting our precious coastline – Its possible to do both. I will work with local stakeholders and licensable authorities to enhance the cities tourism, cultural offering and supporting industries.\nSee off the Tories by ensuring sewage discharge levels are cut. I would work with and lobby Anglian Water and central government to ensure that proper scrutiny, enforcement, and environmental policies are adhered to.\nPublic Transport will see me push forward a campaign for better bus routes and improvements to the wider rail infrastructure with increased connectivity. Infrastructure that requires ticket offices to remain open – with staff present!\nTimes were tough in my house growing up under the Tories and today people, ordinary people are struggling again – after 13 years of Tory misrule. I am fiercely proud to call myself working class, with working class values. Values that I will stand up for in parliament.\nThe Tories with James Duddridge in tow, crashed the economy, and Southend East and Rochford is paying the price. Increasing food banks and rising homelessness must be tackled and fixed. The days of Tory MP’s posing for selfies at shelters whilst not working to fix the actual problem will stop with a Labour MP with a strong moral compass.\nShoebury Resident\nThorpe Bay Resident\nVictoria Resident\nSouthchurch Resident\nRochford Resident\nSouthchurch resident\nThe Wakerings Resident\nRochford Resident\nSouthend Resident\nShoebury resident\nSouthend Resident",

My wife, our two sons, and our daughter have been incredibly supportive to me throughout this journey, and I can’t begin to describe how important their encouragement has been.\nSeeing my family helping out on the campaign trail filled me with immense pride. Their presence and enthusiasm reminded me why I am working so hard to bring about change. Balancing family time with the demands of the campaign hasn’t been easy, but their unwavering support has made all the difference.\nLabour’s commitment to supporting families through key principles resonates deeply with me, especially as a parent. Here are some of the key policies we are championing:\nBringing Back the Family Doctor and Improving Local NHS Care\nLabour’s health policy is centered on transforming the NHS into a Neighbourhood Health Service. We will cut red tape to free up GPs, allowing them more time with patients. Patients will have the option to see the same GP at each appointment, and we will trial Neighbourhood Health Centres, which will bring together family doctors, district nurses, care workers, physiotherapists, and mental health specialists under one roof.\nFree Breakfast Clubs in Every Primary School in England\nLabour plans to improve school attendance by introducing breakfast clubs for all primary school children in England. This initiative will give every child the best start to their school day and provide parents with more choices about work, paving the way for a modern childcare system.\nIt was wonderful to share these policies with the people of Southend while having my family by my side. Their support and the support of our community are what drive me to work even harder.\nFamily life is essential for everyone. It provides a foundation of love, support, and stability that helps us all thrive. Labour’s policies are designed to strengthen families and communities, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to build a better future together. By focusing on education, healthcare, and support for working parents, we are committed to creating a society where families can flourish and every individual can achieve their full potential."
