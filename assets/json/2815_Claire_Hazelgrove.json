Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.\nRight of access\nYou may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a “subject access request“).\nWe follow the ICO’s “Subject Access Code of Practice” when dealing with requests for access to personal data. You can read this code by visiting https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2014223/subject-access-code-of-practice.pdf.\nPlease note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to or contain your personal data.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to rectification and erasure\nYou may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten“).\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to restrict processing\nWhere we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the sections of this privacy policy which explain how and why we use your information), you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.\nYou may also ask us to stop processing your personal data: (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us to verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; or (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nPlease note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to portability\nWhere you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.\nBecause of the nature of the work we do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party, we are happy to consider such requests in good faith.\nYour right to stop receiving communications\nAs noted above, where we send you email marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those communications).\nAlternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us directly – you can unsubscribe by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.\nYour right to object to automated decision making and profiling\nYou have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.\nExercising your rights\nWhen you write to us making a request to exercise your rights, we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\nIt will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information, then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case, we will tell you).\nYou will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one (1) month. However, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you of this and keep you updated.\n- RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is the supervisory body authorised by the Data Protection Act 2018 to regulate the handling of personal data within the United Kingdom.\nThe contact details for the ICO are:\n- Information Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF\n- Telephone: 0303 123 1113\n- Website: https://ico.org.uk/concerns/\nLast updated: 30/09/2022",

She’s a relentless campaigner, always out knocking on doors, lobbying me about buses and standing up for the community. I also know she is passionate about our NHS and a champion for animal welfare, a cause close to my heart too. Importantly she’s got the national experience and know-how to get straight down to work as Labour MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke. Being an MP also needs empathy and understanding. Claire cares and her compassion shines through.\nI know how tough it is to take a seat from the Tories. You need a great team of campaigners and a candidate who will put everything into it.\nI've known Claire Hazelgrove for years and she’s already shown that she has what it takes to win.\nI have no doubt that Claire will do you and our party proud and lead a campaign that secures the vital Labour gain we need in Filton and Bradley Stoke.\nClaire has a feel for campaigning. She really listens to what people want to say and can connect with ordinary people on the doorstep. She could do this big time in a General Election. On top of her personality, she’s got skills that are going to make her win. We need an MP who does something and Claire’s not going to be invisible in the House of Commons.\nI’m backing Claire because I think we need an MP who is visible in the area. Claire’s local, she’s out listening to people in this area every chance she gets, and I know she will fight for what they need.\nClaire Hazelgrove is incredibly committed to what she does for the Labour Party. She has been knocking doors and talking to people here for a long time. She’s helped out in so many ways. Because of this I think she’d be an ideal candidate for our CLP. She knows the people here, she’s genuinely committed to what she does and - most of all - she actually cares. Claire has exactly what it takes and I think she should be our candidate for the next election.\nClaire is hardworking and very knowledgeable about the Party and the constituency. She is very much a people person and has the same values I do. After 60 years of Labour Party membership - 30 years in this constituency - I’m sure these are the values that the people here would vote for come a General Election.\nIt’s my pleasure to be supporting Claire Hazelgrove. Claire is very helpful and very kind. She always thinks of her fellow person. She’s a great contrast with our current MP who has backed nearly every wrong decision that the Conservatives have made for the last 12 years. Claire will do anything in her power to help people and we’re very grateful for her.\nI’m proud to be supporting my friend Claire to be Labour’s first MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke. Claire will make a great candidate because she is a tough, resilient campaigner who will work day and night to win this seat for Labour. She will build an inclusive, energetic campaign to beat Jack Lopresti and the Tories.\nClaire will also make an outstanding MP. She is one of the kindest and most empathetic people I’ve met, who always puts others first. Claire will stand up for the best of our values, give a voice to all communities, and deliver real change.\nClaire will also make an outstanding MP.

She’s a considerate, down to earth person who’s always listened intently to the concerns of local people.\nI’m supporting Claire as we need a MP in Filton & Bradley Stoke who puts the needs of their constituents at the forefront of their work. We have spent the last 12 years with a MP who has in the main voted against the best interests of the majority of his constituents; the next General Election will be our opportunity to change this. We need someone who listens and cares for their constituents, the area and our future. In Claire I believe we will have exactly that person.\nI met Claire for the first time at one of our canvassing sessions. From the beginning you could see the dedication for the cause and hard work she is willing to put in for the residents of Filton and Bradley Stoke. This intertwined with her extensive experience in activism and delivering change makes her a great candidate.\nClaire has years of unbeatable experience of working at a national and international level to campaign and deliver for the Labour movement. She has also been extremely impressive with her dedication to local campaigning activities.\nI honestly believe FaBS is lucky to have such a formidable candidate with a national profile within the Labour Party standing for selection and I know she will make an exceptional MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke.\nClaire’s rooted in our shared Labour values and has more than 15 years’ experience working for our movement. Claire is empathetic and a relentless campaigner, who takes time to understand issues people face. It’s not only what Claire says, but what she does, that makes her the right person to represent Labour in FaBS.\nI believe Claire can improve people’s lives here. She has the same core values as me, understands the importance of the engineering industry within FaBS that I work in, and has the capability and experience to win for Labour.",

  "https_clairehazelgrove_co_uk/https_clairehazelgrove_co_uk_priorities/content_3.html": "I’m out listening to local people all year round, and I will act on the issues that matter most to you and our communities:\nIndividuals and families are being forced to make impossible choices, while oil and gas producers are raking in record profits. Labour will get energy bills down with a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants, and keep them down by switching on Great British Energy – a publicly-owned clean power company providing energy independence and helping tackle the climate crisis too.\nAt the same time, young people are struggling to find decent jobs that pay – let alone get a foot on the housing ladder. The costs of childcare are extortionate, keeping the parents – often women – who want to work out of work. I will prioritise these issues in a way that puts people and places first.\nAfter 14 years of Tory cuts and underinvestment, our public services and dedicated workers need to be properly supported and invested in again. Our ambulance wait times here are the worst in the country. It’s almost impossible to register with an NHS dentist.\nCrime and anti-social behaviour are growing concerns locally – everyone deserves to feel safe here. Capacity in our schools, GP surgeries and on our roads must also be considered as more homes are built. I will push for proper investment in and support for our public services and workers, raise local issues and get action wherever needed.\nLabour will bring in more doctors, dentists, teachers and police where needed most, funded by closing tax loopholes and exemptions, while we start the hard yards of reform to support our services too – so they’re back on their feet again and fit for the future.\nFrom ensuring there are enough affordable homes for people to rent or buy, to preserving the culture of our communities and protecting our environment as they are built or converted, housing is a crucial issue across our communities.\nUsing my experience campaigning to improve housing and tackle homelessness, I will work closely with the community, council, Metro Mayor and government to make sure that these issues we face locally are front and centre – and acted on.\nWe will build 1.5 million more homes over the next parliament. We will also help first-time buyers and young people with a new Freedom to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme and give local people first-dibs on new homes in our area.\nIt is too hard to get across our community, and harder to know if a bus we’re relying on to get to work, to a hospital appointment or to see friends and family will even turn up.\nI have already brought local people together with the Metro Mayor to share views on the bus service we need. I will be an active champion of reliable and public transport to help more people to feel able to use this to get from A to B in a more environmentally friendly way.\nLabour will speed up bus franchising and give communities the opportunity to take back control of local bus services.\nWe need to have more good jobs and training available in the industries of the future here – including hydrogen energy for flight, building on Filton’s proud aerospace heritage. We need to better connect school, college and university graduates to local employers, so that people don’t feel they need to leave the place they call home to have a chance to succeed.\nIf done right, there are many opportunities ahead for our local industries and workers and I will work with businesses, unions and co-operatives to help make sure that our local people and places benefit from them.\nLabour will introduce a New Deal for Working People to make work pay. We’ll boost wages, make work more secure and support working people to thrive – delivering a genuine living wage, banning exploitative zero hour contracts, and ending fire and rehire.\nWe must protect our planet and our stunning nature here for future generations to enjoy. We already face real risks of an increase in flooding locally, and we’ve all felt the effects of an unusually hot few summers and long winters.\nI will work actively within the community and in Parliament to get the support that local people and organisations want and need. From making it easier and cost-effective for people to insulate homes to help keep energy bills down, to working towards the larger scale leadership and co-operation needed at a national and international level, I will be a strong advocate for action.\nAt the heart of Labour’s approach will be our Green Prosperity Plan where, in partnership with business though our National Wealth Fund, we will invest in the industries of the future. Our plan will create 650,000 jobs across the country by 2030.",
