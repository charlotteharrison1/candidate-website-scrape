Francesca spoke about her journey from operating a food truck to opening a successful brick-and-mortar shop with her partner, David Ludlow, six months ago. The shop is now a favourite for locals, serving authentic Brick Lane bagels and a variety of fresh, made-to-order options.\nShe went on to visit The Rose Garden Florist, where she met owner Stephanie Harris. Stephanie, who founded the shop in 2015 and now employs nine staff across two locations, shared her thoughts on the challenges facing small businesses, including Labour’s increases to employer National Insurance Contributions and business rates.\nMrs. Badenoch’s final visit was to Greetings of Dunmow, a card and balloon shop run by Beverley Palmer and her partner Paul Brown. Beverley reflected on her journey from market stallholder to running a well-loved high street business for over a decade, while raising concerns about the strain of rising costs on small enterprises.\nCommenting, Mrs. Badenoch said\n“Small businesses like The Little Bagel Box, The Rose Garden, and Greetings of Dunmow are so important to our local communities. They bring character to our high streets, provide jobs, and help keep our local economy thriving.\n“Which is why on Small Business Saturday this year I have been encouraging residents to shop local, particularly during the festive period. We must support all of our fantastic businesses across North West Essex, because if we don’t, we will lose them.”\nCommenting, Stephanie Harris, owner of The Rose Garden Florist said:\n“We were delighted to see Kemi visit our Dunmow High St florists shop and to hear of her passionate interest and support for local small businesses and the issues we face in the current difficult economic climate.”",

During her visit, Mrs Badenoch toured the facility and engaged in detailed discussions with Managing Director Mark Rawe and the team about the mounting regulatory challenges facing UK manufacturers.\nHunter Scientific outlined its concerns over an uneven regulatory landscape in the UK medical device market. The company raised concerns that identical IVF products are reportedly misclassified overseas as Class 1 devices, whereas UK manufacturers are required to meet more demanding Class IIa compliance—creating a stark disparity in costs and market conditions.\nIn addition, Hunter Scientific highlighted the significant financial burden of compliance. The firm faces regulatory fees exceeding £100k—including a substantial portion incurred in 2024—and relentless audits, factors that together hinder innovation and competitiveness. Compounding these issues is the complexity of the MHRA’s Public Access Registration Database (PARD), which complicates product registration for laboratory technicians.\nCommenting on the visit, Mrs Badenoch said:\n\"Hunter Scientific stands at the forefront of medical innovation, yet UK businesses like them are facing critical challenges in the medical device market.\n“The MHRA and BSI must ensure UK SMEs have an even playing field with foreign competitors.”\nManaging Director Mark Rawe added:\n\"Kemi’s visit offered a valuable opportunity to demonstrate how our SME, deeply rooted in the local community, not only supplies UK clinics but also exports to more than 30 countries worldwide, despite the challenging regulatory environment.\nENDS",

But the country knew who Boris was and why they voted for him. With Starmer, after years of watching him, the truth is still foggy – until you realise he’s not guided by principles at all. Our Prime Minister just says whatever he needs to get through the next news cycle, the next day or the next election. That’s not leadership. That’s cowardice.\nThe truth is that Keir Starmer is the trivial one. He merely pretends to be serious, wearing glasses paid for by another man, and spouting opinions given to him by others. He blows with the wind, twisting like a weathervane. There is no conviction, no moral core. Just performance. When faced with hard decisions, he dodges them. And he breaks his promises.\nHe promised not to raise taxes on working people. His first Budget did exactly that – with a punishing jobs tax that’s hurting the very businesses he claims to support. He said he was on the side of pensioners, then snatched away winter fuel payments without warning, leaving 10 million older people wondering why they’d been lied to. He claimed to back British farmers. Then he introduced the family farms tax, making it harder for family-run farms to pass their land to the next generation.\nStarmer’s approach to women’s rights has been just as slippery. I’ve spent years fighting to protect single-sex spaces, to ban puberty blockers for children, and to push back against a dangerous ideology that tells young people they were born in the wrong body. Labour, by contrast, mocked those efforts. David Lammy called me a dinosaur. And Starmer hounded Rosie Duffield out of his party for saying only women have cervixes – something he now claims to believe himself.\nI have acknowledged the mistakes my party made when in office. When the facts change, most people reflect. Keir Starmer doesn’t. He just rewrites the record. This week, he couldn’t even bring himself to apologise to the woman he forced out of his party for telling the truth. That tells you everything. This is not a man who defends the vulnerable. Not a man who takes responsibility. Not a man with the moral courage to say: “I was wrong.”\nAnd it’s not just at the top. The rot runs through his party. Labour doesn’t govern. It mismanages. From Whitehall to your local town hall, the same pattern repeats: high taxes, failed services and a refusal to admit when things are going badly wrong.\nRight now, Britain needs real leadership. A plan and not vague promises and media-trained soundbites. A vision. A spine.\nJust look at Birmingham. Labour councillors bankrupted the largest local authority in Europe after wasting millions on a failed IT system and botching equal pay settlements. Now residents are facing a 7.5 per cent council tax hike and streets piled with 26,000 tonnes of uncollected rubbish. Rats the size of cats roam the city. This isn’t a metaphor – it’s Labour governance in action. Birmingham’s Labour MPs are more interested in Gaza than in Birmingham’s Gosta Green.\nBut it doesn’t stop in Birmingham. Across the country Labour councils don’t do the basics. Potholes go unfilled. Bins go uncollected. Council tax soars. Local services shrink. They talk about fairness while delivering chaos. They talk about compassion while bankrupting cities. And when challenged, they point fingers and change the subject.\nThe real problem is this: Labour can’t govern because it can’t tell the truth. It can’t learn from failure because it won’t admit where things are going wrong – such as rising unemployment, stubborn inflation and general decline. Starmer can’t lead because he doesn’t know where he’s going. His chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, reportedly said he “acts like an HR manager, not a leader”. I disagree. Most HR managers at least know what their values are.\nRight now, Britain needs real leadership. A plan and not vague promises and media-trained soundbites. A vision. A spine.\nThis coming week, voters have a chance to speak. Local elections matter. Mayoral elections matter. These elections shape the services you use every day. The people you choose will be in control of budgets of hundreds of millions of pounds. But these elections are also a moment to send a message to a prime minister who thinks he’s above scrutiny. Who won’t answer basic questions. Who thinks he’s too clever to be held to account.\nThis article was originally published in The Telegraph",
