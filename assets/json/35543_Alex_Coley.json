From 2024/2025, we want a funding formula that prevents the majority of police funding coming from council tax.\nMore details\nFrom 03/2016 - 03/2024 the Council Tax precept increased by a percentage of 71%. Government funding increased by 29%. This year the precept will increase by up to 7.6% vs 4.5% government funding.
