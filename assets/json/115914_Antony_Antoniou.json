He suggested if this was not the case for a sex worker, they could ‘get better clients’.\nWriting about masturbation Bish suggested children could practice on plasticine models of their genitals to understand how to touch themselves, a move the Safe Schools Alliance told The Times was ‘sexual abuse’.\nCOMMENT\nIf ever there were a time where we were clearly entering Aldous Huxley’s ‘Brave New World’ it is now. This must be the most blatant act of mass perversion in recent history. Children are being systematically abused, psychologically as well as physically. We need only look at social media to see the that there is so much pressure on them to be sexual from a young age.\nMr Hancock suggested using lube during anal sex……..REALLY?\nThis is advice being given to fourteen year olds, probably even younger than that. If this is not moral perversion, then I don’t know what is. We are in a climate of moral bankruptcy, these people are taking the innocence away from children, they are making pornography available to them, they are manipulating young minds for their own hideous agenda.\nTHE EFFECT OF PORNOGRAPHY\nWhilst there is nothing wrong with consenting adults watching erotic content, that is an entirely different scenario from young people being raised on it. Let’s start from the very basics of adolescent experience. Many of us remember being young and being young and experiencing the nervousness of our first kiss, our first fumble, our first intimate encounter. Today, the vast majority of children have watched porn by the age of 12, this is not young boys looking at naked photos of women in a magazine and giggling, or even getting excited, this is subconscious programming, it is not just inappropriate, it is actually damaging young minds permanently.\nOne of the most common sexual issues of the modern day is Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction, what is this?\nMen who watch porn too frequently are finding that their minds are being re-programmed, to the point where they are actually struggling with an erection in real life situations, because they are finding that they are only aroused by porn, but with the ability to scroll backwards and forwards, in a very complicated way, they become addicted to certain scenes, certain sections of what they watch and the entire process of ‘excitement by anticipation’ become damaged.\nIn adult males, there is something called a ‘sexual reset’ which is based on abstinence from sex and porn for weeks or even months. This is not easy, as the addiction to porn doesn’t go away, the temptation is there every single day, but with time, the sexual chemistry in the brain can reset back to normal, when it becomes possible to engage in a normal sexual relationship.\nHowever, with the young, things are not so straightforward, the evidence suggests that the subconscious programming to young minds by porn cannot be reset so easily, in many cases the effect on young developing minds can become permanent. It is natural for developing minds to experience confusion as they grow in to adults, maybe they have doubts about their sexuality, maybe they have other issues, this is all part of growing up, but the toxic effect of porn is causing permanent damage. This also raises questions about young people being subjected to influence about sexuality, gender and many other modern day liberal, woke agendas.\nFurther information on this topic HERE\nABUSE\nIn my opinion, any from of pre-meditated influence imposed on young people is abuse, or at the very least, grooming. As a society, how far are we prepared to allow these people to go? When are we going to say, enough is enough?\nThe question of when a child is no longer a child may be open to interpretation in many people’s minds, however despite their physical maturity, the current laws in the UK are probably spot on. For those who are not aware, the age of consent may be 16, but not in all circumstances, where an adult is in a position of care, Foster care, Teacher etc. it is actually 18, there is a genuine and valid reason for this. In fact, there are countries that have adjusted their minimum age of consent to take in to account ‘those of a similar age’ which is to protect boys of a similar age, but this could be seen as a reduction in the age of consent by stealth. It would be far more beneficial to address any confusion between the ages of 16 to 18, by keeping the minimum age of consent, but enforcing ‘similar age legislation’ to those between 16 and 18, to protect teenagers from older predators, perhaps implementing a limit of 4/5 years older, but definitely the age of consent must not be reduced nor should there be anything other than factual information presented by those in a position of trust.\nThe interaction between teenagers is one thing, but that is not the same as the influence of an adult, that is not a natural or moral situation. This vile agenda of those in a position of responsibility should not be allowed to continue without objection en-mass from anyone who still has a shred of morality left, despite the blatant demonic rhetoric from those who seek little more than the destruction of civilised society with malice aforethought.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_we-need-to-act-on-immigration/content_582.html": "We need to act on immigration\nThe UK’s Immigration Crisis: Saying “No More” is the Only Solution\nThe United Kingdom is facing an unprecedented immigration crisis. Each week, thousands of migrants arrive illegally on British shores, overwhelming resources and infrastructure. Many have proposed solutions, from offshoring processing centers to deals with Rwanda. But the time has come for the British people and government to firmly say “no more.”\nThe Scale of the Crisis\nThe numbers speak for themselves. Recently, 11,000 migrants arrived by boat on the Italian island of Lampedusa in just one week. This is not an isolated incident, but the start of a massive wave. Unless something changes immediately, millions could flood into the UK and wider Europe.\nEuropean nations are already bursting at the seams. Housing, healthcare, education – basic infrastructure is straining under the influx. The UK must say “enough is enough” before the situation deteriorates further. Proposed solutions like the [failed Rwanda deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61835648) are mere political trophies, not real answers.\nDanger to Citizens\nUnchecked immigration also poses a direct threat to the safety of British citizens. With unknown numbers flooding in unchecked, there are no background checks or controls over who enters the country. Criminals can slip through alongside legitimate asylum seekers. Women and children are especially at risk.\nNo nation can maintain security or social services while allowing uncontrolled hordes to wander freely. The first duty of government is protecting its own citizens. That requires regaining control of borders and vetting all who wish to enter.\nTime to Close the Doors\nThe days of unlimited immigration must end. With finite resources, the UK cannot take in unlimited numbers. Politicians must tell immigrant source countries that the doors are shut. While no nation can completely prohibit immigration, the UK’s first loyalty is to its own population.\nThe UK has over 6,000 islands, many capable of hosting offshore processing centers. No migrants should set foot on the mainland until thoroughly vetted. The vast majority are not legitimate asylum seekers anyway, but rather illegal economic migrants. [Under the Dublin Regulations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-asylum-and-nationality-acts-information-sharing-with-eu-and-non-eu-countries), true asylum seekers should have applied in the first EU country reached.\nTime to Leave the ECHR\nTo regain control of its borders, the UK must be prepared to break with failing institutions like the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Rather than protecting legitimate rights, the ECHR has become a cash cow for human rights lawyers who prioritize migrants over citizens. Britain’s courts, government and people should decide its immigration policies, not foreign bodies. Leaving the ECHR will be painful, but essential to protect British sovereignty.\nPeople Power Can Change Things\nThe political class has repeatedly failed to address immigration. The two main parties are beholden to special interests who profit from mass migration against the public’s wishes. With the electoral system rigged in their favor, there seems little hope.\nYet determined citizens can force change. Independents and minor parties can deny major parties a majority, breaking their power. By targeting seats in a coordinated way, just a handful of grassroots campaigns could neuter the establishment parties. When politicians must beg votes from the people, they will have to start listening.\nConclusion\n- The UK faces massive uncontrolled immigration overwhelming services and threatening social order\n- Politicians’ token efforts have failed. Only saying “no more” can avert disaster.\n- The UK must close its doors, process migrants offshore, and be prepared to defy institutions like the ECHR\n- Citizens must elect independents to force the main parties to act in the public interest\n- With determination and organization, the people can compel a stubborn political class to defend the nation’s borders, sovereignty and citizens\nThe immigration crisis seems daunting, but it’s not inevitable. Through courage and determination, the British people can demand the government uphold its duties and say “no more.” United, we can take back control. But there is no time to lose – we must act now before it’s too late.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_ban-plastic-bottles-immediately/content_675.html": "Ban plastic bottles immediately\nIn recent years we have seeing an increasing number of environmental activists protesting, angry with the world and demanding immediate action.\nWatching the last few protests, there was one thing that jumped out at me when I was watching them, they all had water in plastic bottles!\nWhilst we are all aware that something needs to be done about the climate there are things that can be done immediately one of those should be to rid the world of the contamination from plastic bottles.\nThe last few years have seen the rise of the net-zero brigade, a badly planned aspiration for the UK to reach zero emissions by 2050, but how will that be accomplished and at what price? The rush to move to renewable energy has seen the UK become dependant on fossil fuels, when it need not have been, as we could have been entirely self-sufficient with Nuclear energy by now, but that’s another story.\nIn the meantime, what can we do that will have an immediate effect?\nThe Greta Thunberg fan club have been out in force, gathering in protest, sat around with their Veggie-Burgers, with their legs crossed, watching channel 4 and spitting venom at the lack of action about the environment, yet they are all sat their with bottles of water, that is one of the largest contributors to a crisis in our oceans, in fact, particles of plastic have now entered the food chain and have already been found in the Kidneys of humans who have eaten the fish that have digested plastic.\nWe could eradicate the vast majority of plastic in not time, but why is nobody addressing this?\nWhat would be the harm in forcing all shopping malls, local authorities, leisure facilities and so on, to install water fountains within a year? In the meantime, plastic bottles could be eradicated, by being banned, or taxed to such a degree that they are no longer viable. We didn’t really have bottled water a few decades ago and everyone was fine. surely this would be a dramatic first step?\nIn order to improve our world, we must take tangible steps that yield instant results, rather than token gestures and excuses to make money from people.\nThere are so many alternatives to plastic bottles and containers, token gestures are just not having any significant effect. We need measures that will work, not just token gestures.\nIt seems that successive governments do very little when it comes to the crunch. I have no doubt that there are some very wealthy and powerful individuals and corporations who apply pressure behind the scenes, to place a stranglehold on any direct action but this must be stopped.\nPlastic is becoming so toxic to life on earth that to neglect to act now, would be allowing a serious threat to life, of all forms, in the oceans, as well as our towns and cities. We are sleepwalking in to a catastrophe, yet we are being hoodwinked in to being angry about our emissions not falling fast enough, despite the fact that we are rapidly becoming one of the cleanest nations on earth..\nIf we are going to take steps to improve things, they must be real and effective, not token gestures that simply hit the poorest hardest.\nThere are many issues and there is not doubt that the entire world must act quickly, but we must deal with pollution that can be dealt with immediately first, not just talk about it or charge 10 pence for a shopping bag and pat ourselves on the back in self-congratulation.\nWe the public have the whip hand, the choice and the ability to force change, therefore we must do so, before it is too late.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-salamis/content_360.html": "Ancient Salamis\nSalamis (Ancient Greek: Σαλαμίς, Greek: Σαλαμίνα) is an ancient Greek city-state on the east coast of Cyprus, at the mouth of the river Pedieos, 6 km north of modern Famagusta. According to tradition, the founder of Salamis was Teucer, son of Telamon, who could not return home after the Trojan war because he had failed to avenge his brother Ajax.\nEarly history\nThe earliest archaeological finds go back to the eleventh century BC (Late Bronze Age III). The copper ores of Cyprus made the island an essential node in the earliest trade networks, and Cyprus was a source of the orientalizing cultural traits of mainland Greece at the end of the Greek Dark Ages, hypothesized by Walter Burkert in 1992. Children’s burials in Canaanite jars indicate a Phoenician presence. A harbour and a cemetery from this period have been excavated. The town is mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions as one of the kingdoms of Iadnana (Cyprus). In 877 BC, an Assyrian army reached the Mediterranean shores for the first time. In 708 BC, the city-kings of Cyprus paid homage to Sargon II of Assyria (Burkert). The first coins were minted in the 6th century BC, following Persian prototypes.\nThe Theatre, Salamis\nDating from the time of Augustus (31 BC to AD 14), the theatre once held 15,000 spectators. Much of it was destroyed by earthquakes, leaving stone raiders to seize its blocks for building projects elsewhere. Since then, it has been partially restored and occasionally hosts outdoor events.\nCyprus was under the control of the Assyrians at this time but the city-states of the island enjoyed a relative independence as long as they paid their tribute to the Assyrian king. This allowed the kings of the various cities to accumulate wealth and power. Certain burial customs observed in the “royal tombs” of Salamis relate directly to Homeric rites, such as the sacrifice of horses in honor of the dead and the offering of jars of olive oil. Some scholars have interpreted this phenomenon as the result of influence of the Homeric Epics in Cyprus. Most of the grave goods come from the Levant or Egypt.\nAccording to the foundation myth, the founder of Salamis is said to be Teucer, son of Telamon, who could not return home after the Trojan war because he had failed to avenge his brother Ajax. There is however some evidence that the area had been occupied long before the alleged arrival of Mycenaeans (at Enkomi) and the town of Salamis was developed as a replacement when Engkomi was isolated from the sea. There is otherwise little direct evidence to support the foundation myth.\nRoman Villa\nSouth of the theatre, the villa was originally a two-storey structure made up of a reception hall and an inner courtyard with columned portico. The villa was utilised long after the city was finally abandoned and used as an olive-oil mill. The grinding stone can still be seen today.\nKambanopetra Basilica\nThe vast remains of this 4th-century basilica are an entrancing spot with lonely columns backed by the sea. Originally it would have been an impressive church with three apses. In the complex behind the church (believed to have contained a bathhouse) there is an intricate, well-preserved mosaic floor.\nBasilica of Agios Epifanios\nOnce the largest basilica in Cyprus, this church was built during the episcopacy of Epifanios (AD 386–403) and completely destroyed during Arab raids in the 7th century.\nReservoir\nAt the southern end of the site you come to the Roman-era reservoir, which stored the water brought to Salamis by a 50km aqueduct.\nAgora & Temple of Zeus\nJust behind the reservoir are the sparse remains of Agora – the city’s place of assembly during the Roman era – and the Temple of Zeus which the Romans built over an earlier Hellenistic temple. Not much remains from either complex, the stones having long been pilfered for other building projects.\nIn the Greek period\nIn the 11th century BC, the town was confined to a rather small area around the harbour but soon expanded westwards to occupy the area, which today is covered by forest. The cemetery of Salamis covers a large area from the western limits of the forest to the Monastery of St. Barnabas to the west, to the outskirts of the village of Ayios Serghios to the north, and to the outskirts of Enkomi village to the south. It contains tombs dating from the 9th century BC down to the Early Christian period. The earlier tombs are within the forest area, near the boundary of the early town.\nThough Salamis maintained direct links with the Near East during the 8th and 7th centuries BC, there were bonds with the Aegean as well. One royal tomb contained a large amount of Greek Geometric pottery and this has been explained as the dowry of a Greek princess who married into the royal family of Salamis. Greek pottery was also found in tombs of ordinary citizens. At this time the Greeks were embarking on an eastward expansion by founding colonies in Asia Minor and Syria; Salamis must have served as an intermediate station; it has even been suggested that Cypriots helped the Greeks in their venture.\nResistance to Persian rule\nIn 450 BC, Salamis was the site of a simultaneous land and sea battle between Athens and the Persians. (This is not to be confused with the earlier Battle of Salamis in 480 BC between the Greeks and the Persians at Salamis in Attica.)\nThe history of Salamis during the early Archaic and Classical periods is reflected in the narrations of the Greek historian Herodotus and the much later speeches of the Greek orator Isocrates. Salamis was afterwards besieged and conquered by Artaxerxes III. Under King Evagoras (411-374 BC) Greek culture and art flourished in the city and it would be interesting one day when the spade of the archaeologist uncovers public buildings of this period. A monument, which illustrates the end of the Classical period in Salamis, is the tumulus, which covered the cenotaph of Nicocreon, one of the last kings of Salamis, who perished in 311 BC. On its monumental platform were found several clay heads, some of which are portraits, perhaps of members of the royal family who were honoured after their death on the pyre.\nMarguerite Yon (archaeologist) claims that “Literary texts and inscriptions suggest that by the Classical period, Kition [in present-day Larnaca] was one of the principal local powers, along with its neighbor Salamis.”\nAlexander the Great and the Roman Empire\nAfter Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, Ptolemy I of Egypt ruled the island of Cyprus. He forced Nicocreon, who had been the Ptolemaic governor of the island, to commit suicide in 311 BC, because he did not trust him any more. In his place came king Menelaus, who was the brother of the first Ptolemy. Nicocreon is supposed to be buried in one of the big tumuli near Enkomi. Salamis remained the seat of the governor.\nMap showing the ten ancient city Kingdoms of Cyprus\nIn 306 BC, Salamis was the site of a naval battle between the fleets of Demetrius I of Macedon and Ptolemy I of Egypt. Demetrius won the battle and captured the island.\nIn Roman times, Salamis was part of the Roman province of Cilicia. The seat of the governor was relocated to Paphos. The town suffered heavily during the Jewish rising of AD 116–117. Although Salamis ceased to be the capital of Cyprus from the Hellenistic period onwards when it was replaced by Paphos, its wealth and importance did not diminish. The city was particularly favoured by the Roman emperors Trajan and Hadrian, who restored and established its public buildings.\nIn the Roman and Byzantine periods\nThe “cultural centre” of Salamis during the Roman period was situated at the northernmost part of the city, where a gymnasium, theatre, amphitheatre, stadium and public baths have been revealed. There are baths, public latrines (for 44 users), various little bits of mosaic, a harbour wall, a Hellenistic and Roman agora and a temple of Zeus that had the right to grant asylum. Byzantine remains include the basilica of Bishop Epiphanos (AD 367–403). It served as the metropolitan church of Salamis. St. Epiphanios is buried at the southern apse. The church contains a baptistry heated by hypocausts. The church was destroyed in the 7th century and replaced by a smaller building to the south.\nThere are very extensive ruins. The theatre, and the gymnasium have been extensively restored. Numerous statues are displayed in the central court of the gymnasium most of which are headless. While a statue of Augustus originally belonged here, some columns and statues originally adorned the theatre and were only brought here after an earthquake in the 4th century. The theatre is of Augustean date. It could house up to 15.000 spectators but was destroyed in the 4th century.\nThe town was supplied with water by an aquaeduct from Kyhrea, destroyed in the 7th century. The water was collected in a large cistern near the Agora. The necropolis of Salamis covers ca. 7 km² to the west of the town. It contains a museum showing some of the finds. Burials date from the geometric to the Hellenistic period. The best known burials are the so-called Royal-Tombs, containing chariots and extremely rich grave gifts, including imports from Egypt and Syria. A tomb excavated in 1965 by the French Mission of the University of Lyon brought to light an extraordinary wealth of tomb-gifts, which also attest trade relations with the Near East.\nChristianity\nIn what is known as the “First Missionary Journey”, Paul the apostle and the Cypriot-born Barnabas made Salamis their first destination, landing there after heading out from Antioch of Syria. There they proclaimed Christ in the Jewish synagogues before proceeding through the rest of the island (Acts 13:1-5). Tradition says that Barnabas preached in Alexandria and Rome, and was stoned to death at Salamis in about 61 CE. He is considered the founder of the Church of Cyprus. His bones are believed to be located in the nearby monastery named after him.\nSeveral earthquakes led to the destruction of Salamis at the beginning of the 4th century. The town was rebuilt under the name of Constantia by Constantius II (337–361) and became an Episcopal seat, the most famous occupant of which was Saint Epiphanius. Emperor Constantius II helped the Salaminians not only for the reconstruction of their city but also he helped them by relieving them from paying taxes for a short period and thus the new city, rebuilt on a smaller scale, was named Constantia. The silting of the harbour led to a gradual decline of the town. Salamis was finally abandoned during the Arab invasions of the 7th century after destructions by Muawiyah I ( reigned 661-680 ). The inhabitants moved to Arsinoë (Famagusta).\nExcavations\nArchaeological excavations at the site began in the late nineteenth century under the auspices of the Cyprus Exploration Fund.[3] Many of these finds are now in the British Museum in London.\nExcavations at Salamis started again in 1952 and were in progress until 1974. Before the Turkish invasion there was much archaeological activity there; one French Mission was excavating at Enkomi, another at Salamis and the Department of Antiquities was busy almost throughout the year with repairs and restorations of monuments and was engaged in excavations at Salamis. After the Turkish invasion the international embargo has prevented the continuation of the excavations. The site and the museums are maintained by the antiquities service. Important archaeological collections are kept in the St. Barnabas monastery. In the District Archaeological Museum there are marble statues from the gymnasium and the theatre of Salamis, Mycenaean pottery and jewellery from Enkomi and other objects representative of the rich archaeological heritage of the whole district.\nThe public buildings uncovered at the city site of Salamis date to the post-Classical period. The Temple of Zeus Salaminios, whose cult was established, according to tradition, by Teucer himself, must have existed since the foundation of the city; the extant remains date to the late Hellenistic period. Early excavators discovered in the esplanade of the Temple of Zeus an enormous marble capital carved on each side with a caryatid figure standing between the foreparts of winged bulls. Now in the British Museum’s collection, the function of the capital remains unclear, although it does indicate influence from Achaemenid art and is consequently dated to between 300 and 250 BC.",

We will build a common sense justice system that keeps the public safe.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nUrgent Sentencing Review with Automatic Life Imprisonment for Violent Repeat Offenders.\nThose committing second violent or serious offences will receive mandatory life sentences.\nIncrease the Criminal Justice Budget.\nThe budget is almost the same as it was 10 years ago. Increase it from £10 billion to £12 billion to ensure more high calibre staff to cut delays.\nChange the Definition of Hate Crime.\nThe CPS and police definition of a hate crime has led to systemic bias. Members of the British public must not be investigated because ‘any’ person ‘perceives’ that a hate crime has been committed. Proper evidence must be required. Enforce existing laws to stop violent, hate demonstrations such as the Free-Palestine marches.\nCommence building of 10,000 New Detention Places.\nStart expansion in capacity of state built and managed prisons so that life means life for those who endanger the public. Commission disused military bases if needed.\nTackle Organised Crime.\nForeign gang crime accounts for most organised crime in the UK at a cost of £37 billion per year. This includes drugs, people trafficking and money laundering through barber shops, car washes and nail bars. Increase budget for both the National Crime Agency and The National Drugs Intelligence Unit.\nThereafter:\nReform the Child Maintenance Service.\nThe CMS is failing children and parents. It should be a Mediation Service and means-tested child support for parents who cannot arrange finances. Launch a special division of the family court for maintenance and defaults. Share parental care 50/50 where appropriate.\nRights of access for Grandparents.\nStop Child Grooming Gangs.\nSystematic child sexual abuse continues unchecked. Child Protection Services needs a dedicated National Agency working with local charities, councils and health services. Upgraded intelligence can identify high-risk children and filter malicious claims.\nTackle Youth Crime.\nReopen High Intensity Training Camps for young offenders to teach basic education, teamwork and values.

Although it is also unacceptable when acid violence occurs against men, acid violence is a form of violence that has a disproportionate impact on women. It reflects and perpetuates discrimination of women and girls in society, as such it is prohibited by international law. However, all too often it’s a crime that goes unreported and unpunished: survivors of acid attacks live in fear of reprisals for reporting the attack.\nUNITED KINGDOM\nPer capita the UK has one of the highest rates of recorded acid attacks in the world. In 2016, in London alone, corrosive substances were used in 454 crimes, compared to 261 in 2015, according to London Police figures. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many of the attacks are part of gang related activities and that acid is becoming the weapon of choice. The UK does not have tight controls on the sale of acid and nor does it have legislation specific to acid attacks. ASTI has campaigned for tighter controls on the sale of acid and a review of sentencing. In the UK, unlike many countries, men make up the majority of victims. Men also tend to be the perpetrators.\nAttacks involving acid or other corrosive substances have increased by more than two and a half times the figure from 5 years ago. (2012-2016) 228 recorded crimes in 2012 to 601 in 2016\n2011-1016 – there were more male victims than female victims… male victims were more than double that of female\nMost acid attack crimes happened in London, where over 1,200 cases were recorded over the past 5 years. From 2011-1016 there were 1,464 crimes involving acid or corrosive substance\nNorthumbria recorded the second highest with 109 recorded attacks, Cambridgeshire had 69 attacks, Hertfordshire 67, Greater Manchester 57 and Humberside 52\nOf the 2078 acid attack crimes recorded for the years 2011-2016 only 414 of those crimes resulted in charges being brought.\nOPINION\nI think this is definitely a case of ‘import the people, import the problem’ I have on many occasions expressed the politically incorrect opinion that social problems are DEMOGRAPHIC, NOT GEOGRAPHIC! If were were to section off 100sq miles of wasteland in Africa and move 100,000 indigenous Europeans there, in a few decades, there would be law and order, beautiful buildings and an infrastructure.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_living-the-digital-nomad-dream/content_184.html": "Living the Digital Nomad Dream\nPacking up and working from exotic locations is an increasingly tempting prospect\nWhere in the world would you work from if you could? A hilltop village in Croatia? The hip surfing town of Tarifa in southern Spain? Or the lively city of Bogotá in Colombia? All three have recently emerged as locations that are now tempting people to pack their bags and work remotely thanks to their respective digital nomad visas.\nWith 50-plus countries (the number is growing all the time – the Czech Republic is one of the latest) enticing digital nomads with a visa typically lasting a year or longer, the ability to work from anywhere has become a more appetising proposition – especially with the cost of living crisis hitting pockets hard in the UK. It has really taken off after the coronavirus pandemic.\nAs the UK heads into winter, a fair few people will be mulling over the idea of setting up shop in another part of the world for a spell.\nOne recent report said digital nomads “have moved from eccentrics to mainstream in less than a decade”, with one in nine (11%) US workers now describing themselves as one. Another said it expects the global number of digital nomads to top 40 million this year, and rise to about 60 million by 2030.\nHowever, the visa schemes vary, with some more restrictive than others in terms of how they operate and who is eligible.\nPreviously largely a “tech” crowd, nowadays the nomadic demographic is interspersed with more traditional professions such as lawyers and accountants.\nMy Life as a Semi-Nomad\nHands up – I’m a semi digital nomad. Since 2012 I’ve taken my backpack or suitcase and worked from locations as varied as Hsipaw in Myanmar and New York.\nAs an on-off digital nomad for more than a decade, what have I learned?\nFirst, if you are travelling solo, you need to be comfortable spending a lot of time on your own. Although I’ve made lifelong friends and had lots of rich experiences – from dinner with a family at their home in Buenos Aires after meeting them kayaking, to long conversations with strangers on buses – there will be times it’s just me, myself and I. That can be challenging at times, especially when faced with not one but two rabies scares after a monkey and dog attack in Bolivia and Myanmar, respectively.\nHowever, before a trip, I ask friends and contacts on social media if they have any local pals they can put me in touch with. One request led to me staying with Vicky in San Francisco for a few nights – saving me hundreds of dollars. Many have become good friends.\nOver the years I have learned that I enjoy it and feel more productive if I put down some roots and stay in one place for months at a time. That way, you can find your feet, shop at the local food market, make stronger connections and understand the culture more. Although a privilege, constant travelling and lugging suitcases around every few days can feel exhausting at times, and it can be hard to focus on work when you are always on the road.\nIt is worth avoiding non-owner-occupied Airbnbs, given the impact they have on communities. Instead, ask friends and contacts on social media if they know anyone renting out their place while they are away. Also, booking spare rooms via Airbnb is not only considerably cheaper than a whole apartment, it means you can interact more with a local person.\nI love volunteering in the UK, and when I’m overseas I’m always keen to engage with local communities. For example, I’ve volunteered at a soup kitchen in New York, an animal sanctuary in Bolivia and a refugee camp in Berlin. I also use my time overseas to scout out local stories – for example, interviewing former political prisoners in Myanmar.\nTips from a Seasoned Nomad\nChris Cerra, 30, the founder of RemoteBase, an accommodation-focused newsletter aimed at remote workers, has been a digital nomad for six years. Currently in Bulgaria with his partner, Cerra says he usually visits a place for a month or two before moving on – and, in many cases, returning at a later date. He sticks to a schedule when it comes to work, and generally keeps exploring to evenings and weekends. “You need to find a sustainable balance for you.”\nHe avoids travelling in high season: “Visiting before or at the end of peak seasons means you can still have good weather and a nicer experience without all the tourists.”\nAs well as checking for strong wifi, he advises travellers to opt for places that are time zone compatible, “unless you’re a night owl”.\nWhen it comes to accommodation, Cerra recommends checking out local platforms such as Flatio and Idealista in Portugal and Spain, and Blueground in the US.\nOther options that could help preserve money include housesitting through sites such as TrustedHousesitters, home swaps through websites such as HomeExchange, and chipping in with some work through Workaway in return for free accommodation.\nAnother option – and a way to combat loneliness – is to stay in a co-living residence.\n“One of our main values is connecting people in a physical environment,” says Emmanuel Guisset, the founder of Outsite, a co-living company with 50 locations ranging from Mexico City to Biarritz. “They become co-workers, business partners, and some find love.”\nOutsite’s prices vary – at the time of writing, for example, you could pay just over $1,100 (£902) a month in Tulum in Mexico, or more than $3,300 a month to stay at a Chelsea brownstone in New York.\nRecently, the nomad community has attracted a backlash for contributing to gentrification and pushing out local people. Guisset attributes this to people from other countries renting and buying houses rather than digital nomads.\nBut he is aware of the chasm and is introducing ways for nomads to easily integrate and contribute more to the local community. “We have people with strong skills and quite a bit of spare time, so this year we will be connecting nomads up with mentoring programmes with local entrepreneurs and running more regular volunteering initiatives.”\nFamily Life on the Road\n“We try to integrate into the local culture – for example, our children are now fluent in Spanish and currently attend local clubs in Guatemala,” says Lauren Hill, 41, a business strategy consultant who has been travelling with her daughters, 11 and nine, and partner, Tom, since autumn 2020, when they took off on their sailing boat. “We deliberately look for more local experiences.”\nHow does Hill manage home schooling? “We have a routine where the kids will work alongside us and self-study using online programmes. We manage it using Trello boards [to plan lessons], so we can see what they have to do. We also link what they are learning to travelling, so they are not sitting in front of a screen all day. For example, when they were studying the Romans, we visited amphitheatres, and we’ve taken them to a slave museum in St Lucia.”\nTo ensure work goes without a hitch, they pack extra necessities. “Video calls can be difficult if there’s too many people using a network. We use Starlink [a satellite internet system], which costs us $100 a month, and travel with mini generators so we can deal with short-term power outages.”\nTaxes and Legal Considerations\nBefore digital nomads head off, Morag Ofili, a managing associate at the law firm Harbottle & Lewis, says they should check the terms of any double tax treaty between the UK and the other jurisdiction.\n“This is often a useful starting point to understand what income will be taxed, when and by which country,” she says. “You should tell HM Revenue and Customs that you are leaving the UK if you intend to work abroad for at least one tax year, or if you are permanently emigrating. This ensures that your tax records are accurate and gives you a way to reclaim any UK tax that you are owed. Also, ensure that you have a right to work in the country – you may not be able to work on a tourist visa.”\nIn practice, most digital nomads prefer to just be taxed in the UK unless they move to a country for a long period.\nAs for employers, they should ensure that payroll and social security are managed properly, and that they are complying with local labour laws, Ofili says. “Facilitating a shorter move is easier than most employers think but long-term moves require more careful consideration, as it would trigger a change of residency status, may create a permanent establishment for the company, and could require consideration of broader business operational factors.”\nBalancing Travel and Climate Concerns\nIs being a digital nomad tricky when we are living in a climate emergency?\n“I probably take fewer flights than people who take holidays three or four times a year,” Cerra says. “And we spend longer in a place. But I think there’s bigger fish to fry with people flying in private jets.”\nThose mindful of their carbon footprint can find more sustainable options. Having ditched flying and stuck to overland travel for the past four years, I can vouch for a huge network of brilliant and cheap trains across Europe to take advantage of.\nOr, if you are feeling more adventurous, there’s also a spot on a cargo ship if you have the time and patience.\nThe Benefits Outweigh the Hassles\nBut speak to any digital nomad and the benefits they reel off make it worth any delayed bus (or rabies scare).\n“We get to work hard at work time but on our doorstep have new cultures, languages, amazing food, natural beauty that is available to explore and is constantly changing with every new destination,” Hill says.\n“Most importantly, we get quality time with our kids as they grow up and raise them to be true global citizens.”",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_portrait-of-a-cypriot-village-koilani/content_553.html": "Among Krasochoria in Limassol, Koilani is one of the most famous, with a rich, long historical tradition and cultural heritage. It is built in the eastern part of Afamis and its vineyards cover a vast area, lying adjacent to Omodos, Madria, Pera Pedi, Sylikou, Lofou and Vouni. There are remnants and place names from ancient times in the village. It is an Arcadian colony, which is attested to by many place names. The name “Koilani” comes from Kyllini in the Peloponnese, Mount Afamis from Euphemus Zeus in Arcadia, as well as Kremmos of Goddess Ira.\nThere were found several tombs with Roman pots. There are also remnants from the Early Christian Times, the Frankish Period, the Turkish Occupation, and of course our island’s recent history. According to Dean Kyprianos, author of “The Chronological History of the Island of Cyprus,” who came from Koilani, at the time of the Turkish Occupation, the village used to have about a thousand houses, was granted permission to produce and process silk, and it paid–along with other villages–a special tax for the army. There are also mentioned its products: grapes, wine, fruit and vegetables, just like today. It also boasted lowland products, coming from the fields in Paramali. Koilani was the capital of the prefecture of Koilanion, one of the sixteen administrative peripheries into which the Turks divided Cyprus for administrative and tax purposes. It held the same position during the Frankish Occupation, which it kept during the British Period up until the ‘40s.\nDuring the British Occupation, Koilani was an administrative centre with a Register, Court, Police Station, Medical Centre, and a Post Office. It also boasted a number of small industries and labs, such as blacksmith’s shops, shoemaker’s shops and carpenter’s shops. At home, women had silkworms, produced silk, wove and manufactured handkerchiefs, breeches and belts. They also embroidered pipilla, crochet, lefkaritika, and many more. Their textiles were exquisite, and they also made the noted eftaliotika handkerchiefs.\nDown, in the verdant valley, the River Kryos peacefully flows, irrigating the gardens full of apple trees, pear trees and other fruitful trees.\nIn older times, the river waters turned the flourmills, which constituted an important part of the village’s trade. People used to come from the surrounding villages to have their wheat ground and shop, or even make transactions at the governmental offices. All this attracted people from the surrounding villages and brought liveliness and mobility.\nJustifiably, Koilani was the name of the village capital of Krasochoria and Koilanion Prefecture. Up until 1946, the village had a population of 1,300 Greek and 85 Muslim inhabitants. The Muslims had their mosque and a muezzin, as well as a school with 2 teachers. The mosque used to be a Christian temple of Aghia Sophia. Our primary school had 230 students and 5 teachers back in 1946. The social phenomenon of urbanisation from the ‘50s, which still goes on today, literally evacuated the village. Seldom are there any weddings held, while our primary school has been left with two, at times one, teachers. Nowadays, it does not operate.\nThe two churches of the village, the one dedicated to Holy Mary (Panaghia) and the other to the Only Begotten Son of God (Monoghenis), with the two priests each, nowadays operate in turn, for there are a few people and there is only one priest. We nostalgically reminisce about life in the village, back in those hard but beloved years, when toil and hard work took the sting out of any human impiety and selfishness. Human relations were cordial, entertainment was a match for the masses’ happiness, and pain was common ground.\nDespite its desolation, the village still maintains most of its former characteristics. Up until now, it has retained its traditional architecture, since new houses are rarely built. Its characteristic style includes its narrow, uphill alleys, with many impasses. In addition, high walls with gates, arched, vaulted or rectangular, lie imposing, shutting small yards away from prying eyes. It is evident that family asylum was of utmost importance and was highly protected.\nThe whole village is densely built, literally squeezed into whole blocks with terraced houses, adjacent to each other. Decades ago, housewives used to whitewash their walls, adding the noted blue (loulaki), which gave a bright blue hue. The women of Koilani are characterised by neatness, industriousness and prudence. They work in the vineyards, in the home, while in earlier times they used to weave and knit the noted pipilla or the crochet of smilios, and many more. Today, the ones left behind continue with the same deftness all the traditional works, such as the needlecraft, the rusks, glytzista, and keep our folklore tradition.\nMen are equally hardworking and neat. Deep inside of them, there is unique love for progress and diligence, which positively contributed to Koilani’s having so many successful inhabitants, who nowadays comprise the Cypriot society. It is noteworthy that this tradition has deep roots. Koilani is the birthplace of Dean Kyprianos, the 18th century enlightened scholar who wrote “The Chronological History of the Island of Cyprus,” as well as Archbishop Paisios.\nTheir oblations bear testament to their love for their village. An epitaph offered by Dean Kyprianos and vestments by Archbishop Paisios are still with us in the Holy Temple of the Only Son (Monoghenis). Besides, Koilani is the birthplace of Scholar Leontios Efstratios, Anthemios Patriarch of Antiochia, Ecumenical Patriarch Gerasimos Kassavetis and Metropolitan of Dimitrias, Athanasios Kassavetis. Teacher Constantinos Michaelidis (Koilaniefs) fought and got killed in Kilkis in 1912, during the Balkan Wars. Maintaining its old architecture, its inhabitants’ traditional pastimes, with all those tools and utensils of viticulture and the processing of grapes, the village could be said to constitute in itself a Museum, where tradition is kept immutable and long-established works are effortlessly adjusted to new conditions.\nWandering around the village, the visitor gets a feel for times past and lives the peace of another era. In Koilani’s two museums, the Ecclesiastical and the Viticultural one, there remain notable samples of our ecclesiastical tradition and folk art. Apart from the two churches, the village boasts many chapels. The most noted one is that dedicated to Saint Mavri (Aghia Mavri), with significant murals and unusual architecture, under the huge plane tree in a majestic environment. The Association of Koilanians, from the very first years of its foundation, in collaboration with the Community Council, endeavours to revive the village, while maintaining its characteristics.\nIn this vein, the Association helped build two museums and restore the olive mill, while the Department of Antiquities maintained the little church of Aghia Mavri and the Only Begotten Son of God, made cobbled paths, and many more. Besides, there has been an attempt to bring life and mobility to the village, while offering Koilanian emigrants and friends the opportunity to get together. In this framework, Afamia, Palouze’s celebration, is held at the first weekend of October.\nAfamia had already become an institution. Against a beautiful, autumn backdrop, where aromas of grapes and must waft in the air, Koilani celebrates its most exquisite event and invites everyone to join in. It invites them to enjoy a great artistic programme, try the Koilanian palouze, walk along the village’s roads and alleys, visit its museums, churches, school, police station, where painting and photography exhibitions are hosted, and buy products from their source: rusks, soutsouko, nuts, molasse (epsima), raisins, and many more. It also celebrates the opening of the jars (Pithoigia) in November. The village and Aghia Mavri also boast five wineries and several cafe-restaurants.\nKoilani is waitng for you to pay a visit.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_local-councils-in-financial-crisis/content_89.html": "Local Councils in Financial Crisis\nExamining the Causes and Solutions\nRubbish piled up on streets was one of the most evocative images of the 1970s. Now, the spectre of the winter of discontent has returned as Birmingham City Council struggles to stave off bankruptcy. But Birmingham is not alone in this predicament. According to the National Audit Office, a cumulative deficit of nearly £5 billion could place 43% of local authorities at risk of bankruptcy in the coming years.\nThis looming financial catastrophe stems from a complex web of factors: the legacy of austerity measures, growing demands for social care, increased special needs education requirements, equal pay claims, and inadequate means of collecting local taxes. Perhaps most concerning is that financial distress is no longer confined to traditionally deprived areas; affluent, leafy suburbs such as Woking and Croydon in Hampshire now find their councils nearly bankrupt.\nThe Equal Pay Challenge\nBirmingham declared bankruptcy in 2023, citing a £760 million bill for equal pay as a key factor. The issue dates back to the 1970 Equal Pay Act, which initially prohibited firms from paying women lower wages for performing identical jobs to men, as famously occurred at the Dagenham Ford factory. However, since the 1980s, this principle has evolved into the concept of “equal value,” meaning that if jobs are judged to be of comparable value, the pay must be equivalent.\nThis has practical implications: if predominantly male refuge collectors are assessed to be of similar value to predominantly female cleaning or administrative roles, it would be illegal to pay refuge collectors more. The UK’s litigation system, which embraces “no win, no fee” claims, has fostered an industry of lawsuits centred on this equal value clause, with local councils bearing the brunt of substantial financial penalties.\nBirmingham City Council alone has already disbursed over £1 billion to resolve equal value claims. In an attempt to mitigate future claims, the council is currently trying to remove a fourth worker from refuse lorries. The issue isn’t simply about adjusting binmen’s wages; it’s about the ripple effect on jobs that may be somewhat arbitrarily deemed equivalent to refuse collection.\nIronically, this predicament particularly affects left-wing councils that prefer to maintain direct employment within the council rather than outsourcing. One method of circumventing equal pay claims is to outsource work to private companies, though this approach typically incurs higher costs and presents its own set of challenges.\nAusterity: The Elephant in the Room\nWhilst equal pay claims represent a significant burden, arguably the most substantial factor in council financial distress has been the austerity measures implemented since 2010. Local authorities bore the brunt of budget cuts under the coalition government, with the real value of central government grants slashed by 40% between 2010 and 2019.\nThis shortfall was theoretically meant to be offset by higher local taxes, new funding sources, and spending reductions. However, local authorities face restrictions on their ability to raise taxes. Council tax itself is highly regressive, claiming a larger proportion of income from lower-earning households. Moreover, central government can impose limits on council tax increases.\nIn desperate attempts to generate revenue, some local councils have made questionable investments. Croydon, for instance, borrowed nearly half a billion pounds to invest in property development businesses. However, oversight was inadequate, and the council has yet to realise any significant returns whilst paying millions in debt interest.\nDespite implementing higher charges—such as increased car parking fees and new fees for council services—the core spending power of local authorities has diminished by 25% since 2010. Although there has been a marginal increase in spending in recent years, when accounting for population growth, real spending per person remains lower than 2015 levels.\nRising Homelessness and Housing Challenges\nAnother significant factor contributing to council overspending is the surge in homelessness rates over the past two decades. Councils have a legal obligation to provide temporary accommodation for homeless individuals, resulting in substantially higher expenditure on hotels and B&Bs. The UK unfortunately has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the developed world, reflecting the exorbitant rental costs prevalent across the country.\nAlthough local councils have been assigned housing construction targets, they frequently struggle to meet these objectives. This difficulty stems partly from local “NIMBY” (Not In My Back Yard) pressures, as there’s typically minimal local interest in housing development. Additionally, councils argue that expanding housing stock and population isn’t financially attractive because it leads to increased demand for council services without a corresponding rise in central government funding.\nOne potential solution would be to provide local councils with greater financial benefits from increasing housing stock. In the long term, this approach could prove more economical than funding temporary accommodation in hotels and B&Bs. Historically, the UK spent more on building houses than on housing benefit, but in recent decades this pattern has reversed—a telling indicator of a failed housing strategy.\nOne positive development in the past decade has been giving councils 50% of business rate collection, which provides stronger incentives for councils to attract businesses to their areas.\nThe Social Care Crisis\nWhile real funding per person has declined, statutory spending requirements for councils have increased. The most significant driver of higher demand has been social care needs. Local authorities have a legal obligation to provide both adult and children’s social care, and demand has risen dramatically due to an ageing population and declining public health.\nSocial care is undoubtedly an essential component of a welfare state. However, unlike healthcare or pension provision, responsibility for social care falls to local authorities with severely limited fundraising capabilities. As a result, councils are allocating an ever-increasing share of their constrained budgets to social care, forcing them to drastically cut other services such as libraries, parks, and refuse collection.\nThe fundamental issue is that successive central governments have avoided implementing a comprehensive solution to social care funding, consistently postponing difficult decisions. With the over-65 population continuing to grow, social care expenditure will only increase for local authorities in the coming years.\nSpecial Needs Education Funding Gap\nSpecial needs education represents another area of escalating statutory spending. The Children and Families Act of 2014 mandated that children with special needs should receive the highest quality education possible. Since then, there has been an unexpectedly sharp rise in the number of children requiring these services, accompanied by substantially higher costs.\nYet again, while demand has soared, funding has failed to keep pace. The Local Government Association estimates a funding gap of approximately £600 million. Much of this deficit has been temporarily concealed through accounting techniques. When these measures expire next year, council budgets will appear even worse than they currently do.\nThe Fundamental Problem\nIn essence, the central issue is that since 2010, local authorities have had their central government grants cut by 40%. Simultaneously, they were expected to maintain increased spending on social care, special needs education, and homelessness services. The expectation that local councils could magically generate new funding sources to compensate for this enormous reduction in spending was fundamentally unrealistic.\nOne doesn’t need to be an accountant to recognise that this situation was destined for disaster, particularly because many areas of local spending have grown much faster than anticipated, especially special needs education and social care. Additionally, many local councils have been hit by massive backdated equal pay claims.\nConsequently, councils have performed poorly in perhaps one of the most crucial areas of local responsibility: providing affordable housing, which the UK successfully delivered in the 1960s and 1970s. Constantly grappling with short-term cash crises has left no capacity for long-term investment in social housing.\nPotential Solutions\nWhat are the potential solutions to this crisis? Meaningful regional devolution would require councils to have greater tax-raising powers or at least financial incentives to permit housing and property development.\nOne approach that councils should avoid is attempting novel and untested financial strategies to address budget shortfalls through commercial investment. They typically lack the necessary expertise, and such ventures rarely succeed.\nAny genuine resolution to the challenges facing local authorities will necessitate a more sustainable long-term solution for funding social care. It’s worth noting that in 2017, Theresa May’s government proposed utilising housing wealth to fund social care, but the proposal was derided as a “dementia tax.” The policy proved deeply unpopular and nearly caused her to lose the election to Jeremy Corbyn. Nevertheless, it represented an attempt to leverage the UK’s substantial property wealth to address an issue that will only become more pressing in future years.\nUnfortunately, financial difficulties are not confined to local authorities. The central government faces its own substantial fiscal challenges, which will make it difficult to provide bailouts to struggling local councils. As the country navigates these complex financial waters, finding sustainable solutions to local government funding will be one of the most critical challenges for policymakers in the years ahead.\nI’ve restructured the transcript into a comprehensive article using UK English spelling and formatting. The article examines the financial crisis facing local councils in the UK, exploring the multiple factors contributing to this situation including austerity measures, equal pay claims, rising social care demands, and housing challenges. I’ve maintained all the key information while organizing it into clear sections with proper headings to improve readability.\nComment\nThere is a reason that is not mentioned by mainstream media, and that is the demographics of the local authorities that are going bankrupt. It does not require a lot of research to establish that there is a common denominator that is conveniently overlooked.\nWe all know what that common denominator is and despite their best efforts, there comes a point when they cannot squeeze any more out of those who contribute, to fund those who take.",

Recently, Alexander Downer shared his perspectives on the current state of affairs, shedding light on some of the key challenges faced by governments. In this article, I will delve into his discussion and insights, exploring the potential solutions that could lead to a more effective approach to immigration control.\nAddressing the Central Question\nBefore diving into the nitty-gritty, Downer highlights a pressing concern: Can governments truly halt the influx of migrants? In a candid conversation, he examines the complexities surrounding this issue, emphasizing that the heart of the matter lies in Third Country processing for asylum seekers. This strategy, also known as the “Rwanda option,” aims to disrupt the lucrative business model of human trafficking by creating uncertainty for potential migrants.\nThe “Rwanda Option” – Breaking the Business Model\nDowner’s assessment revolves around the idea that economic migrants are more likely to embark on perilous journeys if they believe they can settle in their desired destination. By redirecting asylum seekers to countries where they won’t have a clear path to their chosen destination, governments can potentially discourage migrants from pursuing risky routes. This approach hinges on swift legal resolutions to mitigate the long-standing legal challenges and obstacles.\nComparing Approaches: UK vs. Australia\nDrawing parallels between the UK and Australia, Downer offers insights into the differences in their immigration strategies. Australia’s success in deterring migrants from landing on its shores is often attributed to factors such as legislative reforms, stringent policies, and its absence from the European Convention on Human Rights. He underscores that strategic changes in laws and policies contributed to Australia’s effective approach, resulting in reduced arrivals.\nThe Role of the Home Office and Beyond\nThe Home Office’s role in immigration control is a matter of scrutiny and reform. Downer points out that while the Home Office has its strengths and weaknesses, it’s crucial to acknowledge the intricate challenges it faces. The government’s immigration policies need to encompass a comprehensive approach that differentiates between genuine asylum seekers and economic migrants. This distinction is critical to achieving successful border control and maintaining the integrity of the asylum process.\nTackling the Asylum Approval Conundrum\nA significant concern raised by Downer is the apparent discrepancy in approval rates for asylum applications. He highlights that the high rate of approvals in the UK, as opposed to other countries, could stem from an unclear legal framework and definition of a refugee. By redefining these aspects and ensuring that refugees are indeed fleeing persecution, governments can strike a balance between humanitarian efforts and safeguarding their borders.\nRecommendations for a More Effective Approach\nDowner’s insights offer a blueprint for governments to consider as they navigate the complexities of immigration control:\n1. **Temporary Protection Visas:** Introducing temporary protection visas, as implemented in Australia, could provide a middle ground. These visas would offer refuge while maintaining a review process to assess changing circumstances in the asylum seekers’ home countries.\n2. **Review of Refugee Definitions:** Governments should scrutinize and refine the definitions of refugees and asylum seekers to ensure that only those genuinely fleeing persecution are granted refugee status.\n3. **Comprehensive Policy Overhaul:** The Home Secretary and immigration ministers must undertake a comprehensive review of existing policies to address the nuanced challenges and discrepancies in asylum approval rates.\nConclusion\nAlexander Downer’s insights shed light on the complexities of immigration policies and the need for a multifaceted approach. The “Rwanda option” proposes a strategy to disrupt human trafficking while maintaining humanitarian obligations. By redefining refugee definitions, implementing temporary protection visas, and overhauling policies, governments can strike a balance between border security and providing refuge to those in genuine need. In the face of ongoing challenges, these recommendations offer a starting point for a more effective and holistic approach to immigration control.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-increasing-threat-to-women/content_897.html": "The increasing threat to women\nIntroduction\nThere have been concerning comments on my videos about immigration and the threat to women from some of the men arriving in this country. I haven’t directly covered this topic before as it relates to immigration, although I have previously discussed domestic violence and the protections available to women.\nIn this post I want to examine the current situation and the potential risks we face if we don’t address what is happening. My view is that we are seeing a slippery slope towards misogyny on a scale not witnessed in the UK for many years, even decades or centuries. However, hardly anyone is speaking up.\nA Brief History of Women’s Rights in the UK\nTo understand the current risks, it’s important to recognise the long struggle women have faced to gain rights in the UK. On 18th August last year, it was the 140th anniversary of the Married Women’s Property Act 1882. This was a huge milestone, as it was the first time since the Magna Carta that women had any legal rights.\nIt took several more decades for women to win the right to vote and to vote on equal terms as men. In the 1970s, the Equal Pay Act and Sex Discrimination Act finally brought more equality at work. This shows that equal rights for women in the UK is a relatively recent development.\nDespite this progress, not much was made of the 1882 Act anniversary. The media has instead been distracted by debates over pronouns and immigration rather than focusing on women’s rights.\nThe Arrival of Angry, Entitled Men\nIn recent weeks, we have seen boatloads of aggressive, arrogant young men arriving in the UK. They have expensive clothes and phones, and demand to be housed in 3-4 star hotels while British homeless sleep on the streets.\nThese men have been socialised in cultures with very different attitudes towards women. There are already signs that some have no respect for women, based on reports of their behaviour and actions since arriving here.\nThe Link Between Women’s Rights and Societal Stability\nThere is an important link between how a society treats women and its moral values. Historically, societies that disrespect women and deny their rights eventually decline or fall.\nBefore capitulating to those with very different cultural values, we should keep this warning in mind. People’s words and claimed ideals do not always match their behaviours and intentions.\nOther Threats to Women’s Safety\nOf course, the threats to women’s safety do not only come from immigration. In recent years, the rise of inappropriate online content has also led to more sexual attacks and domestic violence.\nThere are multiple complex factors behind violence against women. However, a common theme is that it thrives when sexist attitudes are prevalent in society.\nInaction and Offence Over Debate\nCurrently, there is a reluctance to openly discuss these issues for fear of causing offence or looking insensitive. The media is more concerned about offending Europe than tackling the problems arising from uncontrolled immigration.\nThis preference for inaction over debate is creating an environment where misogynistic attitudes can spread unchecked. We cannot tackle these threats if we ignore them.\nConclusion\nThe UK faces a choice about what kind of society it wants to be. Will we import regressive cultural problems and create an international demographic dustbin? Or will we stand up for the equal rights and safety of women that have been hard-won over decades?\nTo protect these gains, we must be willing to enforce the law against anyone who promotes terrorism, violence or the oppression of women. The question is whether we have the courage to do so.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-it-is-so-hard-to-get-justice/content_247.html": "Why it’s so difficult to get good legal representation? Not going to have a go at solicitors, well, maybe little bit! However, I will also speak partly in their defence, but more importantly it’s about actually pointing out to you, just how difficult it is to have a solicitor who really is going to go the extra mile to fight your case.\nWhen solicitors are looking for a case law to fight your case, they normally go to a reference library to find case law that is a decision made by a court that can be referenced to so they can by presenting that to the judge, the judge is then almost compelled to go with a decision that was previously made on the grounds of this and that, the following decision was made then it follows that on the grounds of this and that today, the judge should also make the same decision.\nMany solicitors are familiar with the most common ones such as Rylan vs Fletcher 1868 which is the most common one used where the is leakage, this will be familiar to those of you who are landlords or those of you who have apartments and you’ve had a leak from an apartment above and you’ve had to take them to court. A good solicitor will actually reference to Ryan vs Fletcher 1868 as case law the reason that has not been superseded since then is because it is quite a strong case and there are quite a few others like it.\nOnce things begin to get a little more complicated, a good solicitor will go through all the case law to find something that they can throw at the defendant, or vice versa if you’re the defendant. However, it’s not as easy as it sounds, this is what’s called the all England law reports they go back all the way to 1865 and they total 565 volumes and they £35,000!\nThe chances are you’ve probably never seen these in a solicitors office, because the vast majority of solicitors don’t have them and don’t even have access to them, and although you can subscribe to somewhere such as LexisNexis and have online access to them to conduct a search, believe me nothing beats a solicitor and his assistants sat around the table with a few volumes of the all England law reports, to actually find\ncase law that will ensure you will win your case in the court.\nThis is where unfortunately in the courts of law, money talks, because it is all too often, the cream of the crop of solicitors who will have the the full set of the all England law reports and the resources to search them, because they’re being paid to have a team to sit and search for\ncase law and they will find the applicable case law that is relevant to you, to give you the strongest chance of winning in the court.\nAs for the rest, unfortunately they have to wing it with bits and pieces that they can put together online and what they can’t supply in technical and legal knowledge, they literally make up for in flannel. In the defence of solicitors who are regulated by the SRA they are also very constrained in what they can do.\nThe SRA actually is a despicable organisation, made up of people who have come from within the industry, it is a closed-shop, they are not answerable to anyone and any solicitor who goes against the grain will find that later down the line, they face the risk of the SRA picking on them for anything and striking them off, this happens so much and it is from this pool of yes-men where the judges come from and that is\nwhy our legal system is literally in the Stone Age. Still, they are trying to change things, they’ve changed the way that solicitors can enter in the last couple of years, so for those of you who are considering a career in law, it does look as though they are trying to bring new people in\nbut it’s a very, very slow process.\nIn the meantime, for those of us who do want justice, I can say it’s harder than ever and there has never been a time where those who have the wherewithal can literally gag everybody else, as you know the amount of people who slap gagging orders and prevent important information that is in the public interest from being published, is untrue.\nEven the newspapers who are so powerful struggle against the army of solicitors who really know what they are doing and that’s why the judicial system in this country is antiquated and it is desperately in need of an overhaul just thought I would leave uh leave that with\nyou and I’ll see you in the next video.\nThe All England Law Reports\nThe Law Reports Reprint covers all the important English cases reported since 1865. It is divided into the First Series, covering cases from 1865-1875, the Second Series, dealing with cases from 1875-1890, and the Third Series, which includes cases from 1891 to the present day.\nThe cases in each volume are well set out, in a clear, easy-to-read typeface. The headnotes which precede each case conform to an extremely high standard, and each volume contains a comprehensive table of cases reported. The Law Reports are always cited first in court.\nMany purchasers of Law Reports Reprint have added to the usefulness of their sets by purchasing the continuation volumes which are available for the years subsequent to 1971. Each year continuation volumes are published, covering Chancery (bound in red), Appeal cases (brown), Queen’s Bench (green), and Family cases (blue). Each continuation volume opens with a list of judges, a table of cases reported, lists of cases, statutes and statutory instruments and international conventions judicially considered, and a list of subject matter giving a brief summary of cases.\nThe 565 volumes of Law Reports Reprint 1865-1971 represented a reduction of some 84 volumes against the original reports. This reduction was achieved by the amalgamation of several of the smaller volumes, while an electronic process ensured that every page is an exact replica of the original. Each individual division is bound in a different colour to make for ease of identification, greatly speeding up the process of selecting particular volumes.\nNow containing over 680 hard cover volumes, this is an essential tool for legal research.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-hadjigeorgakis-kornesios/content_446.html": "Prominent Cypriots – Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios\nCareer and influence\nHadjigeorgakis Kornesios came from Kritou Terra in Paphos in western Cyprus. Early on he served as interpreter or dragoman. The dragoman was usually a Christian from the local community appointed by the Ottomans, and it was a significant office awarded to highly educated individuals with mastery of both the Greek and Turkish languages. As an interpreter, Hadjigeorgakis dealt mostly with matters of taxation and administration, which brought him into contact with the Ottoman administration of Cyprus, i.e. the muhassil (tax collector) and the Turkish aghas on the one hand, and the kodjabashis (the local prelates) on the other. Around 1796 he was appointed lifelong Dragoman of Cyprus issued by Sultan Selim III.\nThe people and the clergy held Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios in high esteem and this earned him increased power and influence. As a result of his position and connections, the dragoman gained considerable wealth. However, he was not known to use his power and riches for his personal benefit. According to a poem by an unknown author composed after his decapitation, Hadjigeorgakis contributed greatly to the protection of Christians and lepers, offered financial and moral support to the Church of Cyprus and promoted education.\nHe and his wife Maroudia (who was also the Archbishop Chrysanthos of Cyprus’s niece), displayed patriotic and charitable sentiments. Nevertheless, there were many that nursed negative feelings against the Dragoman. His own and the Archbishop’s rise in the political and financial life of Cyprus caused the envy and anxiety of the aghas, who as conquerors had been accustomed to being the principal agents of authority and the privileged beneficiaries of such authority, but now saw themselves being supplanted. On the other hand, a part of the population resented the heavy taxes placed upon them – and consequently, resented Hadjigeorgakis, who was responsible for the collection of such taxes.\nThe French consuls were also hostilely disposed towards him because they considered him a Russophile and, by consequence, an enemy of France. This resentment manifested itself in the 1804 revolt of the island’s Ottomans caused by increased taxation and wheat shortage. The insurgents initially revolted against the imperial authorities, but the latter managed to turn their wrath against the Church and the Dragoman. The angry mob broke into and sacked Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios’ mansion. The Dragoman himself escaped with his family to Constantinople, where they stayed for three years.\nNikolaides and Hasan Agha sent a slanderous report against him to the sultan in order to avoid being called to account for their actions.\nHadjigeorgakis appointed his assistant, a man named Nikolaos Nikolaides, as his commissary. Nikolaides was quick to take advantage of his position to become rich. He collaborated closely with the muhassil and resorted to tyrannical methods for the collection of taxes. When Hadjigeorgakis was cleared of all charges, he returned in 1807 to Cyprus to conduct an audit of the accounts. Nikolaides and Hasan Agha sent a slanderous report against him to the sultan in order to avoid being called to account for their actions. This caused an order to be issued for the Dragoman’s arrest and for a full examination of his accounts for the past 20 years.\nHadjigeorgakis was informed of this development and once again fled to Constantinople to prove his innocence. However, this time he was not successful. Despite the efforts of the ambassadors of England and Russia, the Grand Vizier Kör Yusuf Ziyaüddin Pasha, who resented Hadjigeorgakis, ordered his execution. By the time the Sultan’s order for his release was secured, it was too late. Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios was beheaded in Constantinople on March 31, 1809.\nDescendants and the Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion\nHadgigeorgakis spent a portion of his wealth in building a mansion in the upper class Ayios Antonios area in Nicosia, close to the Archbishop’s residence. After his execution his estate was confiscated and his family suffered several years of exile and imprisonment. Hatice Hanim, of the Turkish family of Magnisali, bought the mansion for 13,000 kuruş. In 1830, Tselepi Yiangos, the Dragoman’s youngest son, returned from Constantinople and bought the mansion with a loan he received from the Archdiocese. Tselepi Yiangos settled there with his wife Iouliani, née Vondiziano. He died in 1874 and his wife remained at the mansion with the family of her niece Ourania Zachariadou Oikonomidi, whom she had adopted for she had no children of her own. The mansion was then inherited by Ourania’s four daughters. The last tenant, Julia Piki, died in 1979.\nHadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion\nThe Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion is situated near the Archbishopric, in the neighbourhood of Saint Antonios in Nicosia, Cyprus, where the wealthy notables of the Greek community traditionally used to live.\nOverview\nThe mansion is the most important example of urban architecture of the last century of Ottoman rule that survives in old Nicosia. It opened on 3 May 1960 with the aid of public subscription, three years after a foundation was established to protect the property from developers who wanted to demolish the block\nHistory of the house\nThe house was built in 1793 with local bloc-cut sandstone and is a two-storey building. The monogram of the owner and the date of its erection can be seen on a marble tablet inside the entrance. The architectural plan of the building in the form of a Greek “Π” surrounds a central garden with a fountain and a private bathhouse (Hammam) which has three rooms. On the ground floor the servants’ quarters and the kitchen were situated. Roofed wooden stairs with a stone base lead to the entrance hall on the first floor from the courtyard. The official reception room and the living areas communicated with this reception hall. The official reception room (the onda), at the end of the east wing, differs from the other rooms with its exceptional carved wooden, gilded and painted decoration, which liken it to other official reception rooms in many mansions of the Ottoman Empire.\nToday\nToday the mansion, which was awarded the Europa Nostra prize for its exemplary renovation work, functions as the Ethnological Museum, Lefkosia (The House of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios). The address is: 20 Patriarchou Grigoriou St, Nicosia. The entrance fees is €2.50.\nCOMMENT\nSo Hadjigeorgakis Kornesisos appointed his assistant, a man named Nikolaos Nikolaides, as his commissary, then this man who he trusted, set out to rake in taxes ruthlessly, then when Hadjigeorgakis returned, he slandered him to cover his actions and by the time the truth was revealed, this innocent man, who had used his good fortune and wealth to actually help people was BEHEADED! Really? Is there now part of our history that is not marred by jealousy, treachery and betrayal?",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-cyprus-internment-camps/content_71.html": "Cyprus internment camps were camps run by the British government for internment of Jews who had immigrated or attempted to immigrate to Mandatory Palestine in violation of British policy. There were a total of 12 camps, which operated from August 1946 to January 1949, and in total held 53,510 people.\nGreat Britain informed the United Nations (UN) on February 14, 1947, that it would no longer administer the Mandate for Palestine. This prompted the UN General Assembly to recommend partition of Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states on November 29, 1947. Some 28,000 Jews were still interned in the Cyprus camps when the Mandate was dissolved, partition was enacted, and the independent Jewish State of Israel was established at midnight Palestinian time on May 14, 1948. About 11,000 internees remained in the camps as of August 1948, with the British releasing and transporting the internees to Haifa at the rate of 1,500 a month. Israel began the final evacuation of the camps in December 1948 with the last 10,200 Jewish internees in Cyprus mainly men of military age, evacuated to Israel during January 24–February 11, 1949.\nHistory\nAnti-deportation protest rally, Tel Aviv, 1946\nIn the White Paper of 1939, the British government decided that future Jewish immigration to Palestine would be limited to 75,000 over the next five years, with further immigration subject to Arab consent. At the end of World War II, there were still 10,938 immigration certificates remaining but the five years had expired. The British government agreed to continue issuing 1,500 certificates per month, but the influx of Jews, especially from the displaced person camps in Europe, well exceeded that number. It was decided in August 1946 to hold many of the illegal immigrants on Cyprus. Previous places of detention had included Atlit detainee camp in Palestine, and a camp in the Mauritius. A few thousand refugees, mostly Greeks but also a “considerable number” of Jews from the Balkans, had reached Cyprus during the war years.\nAt its peak there were nine camps in Cyprus, located at two sites about 50 km apart. They were Caraolos, north of Famagusta, and Dekhelia, outside of Larnaca. The first camp, at Caraolos, had been used from 1916 to 1923 for Turkish prisoners of war.\nSome 400 Jews died in the camps, and were buried in Margoa cemetery.\nBackground\nThe majority of Cyprus detainees were intercepted before reaching Palestine, usually by boat. Some were on vessels that had successfully run the British blockade, but were caught in Palestine. Most of them were Holocaust survivors, about 60% from the displaced person camps and others from the Balkans and other Eastern European countries. A very small group of Moroccan Jews was also in the camps. The prisoners were mostly young, 80% between 13 and 35, and included over 6,000 orphan children. About 2,000 children were born in the camps. The births took place in the Jewish wing of the British Military Hospital in Nicosia. Some 400 Jews died in the camps, and were buried in Margoa cemetery.\nTransshipment and detention camps on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, in which the British authorities held Jewish “illegal” immigrants, most of them European survivors of the Holocaust trying to enter Palestine. On August 7, 1946, the British government made a decision to detain these Jews in Cyprus, hoping that this deterrent would put an end to Jewish immigration. The decision was geared to the British policy of breaking the power of the “Hebrew resistance movement” in Palestine. But before long the British came to realize that detention was not achieving the desired aim. The would-be immigrants continued their attempts to reach Palestine despite violent clashes with British troops and transshipment to Cyprus. By December 1946 the British government, under pressure from the Jewish Agency and in view of the rapid rise in the number of people interned in the Cyprus camps, was allotting half the legal immigration quota (that is, 750 visas, or certificates, a month) to the Cyprus detainees.\nThe British were successful in apprehending most of the 70,000 illegal immigrants who embarked for Palestine. Nonetheless, as space for refugees on Cyprus became scarce and ships continued to sail from Europe carrying ma’apilim, it became apparent to the British that the policy of detention in Cyprus was not successful in deterring the Ha’apala movement.\nThe use of the Cyprus detention camps began on August 13, 1946, and ended on February 10, 1949, when the last group of detainees left for what had become the state of Israel. During this period, fifty-two thousand Jews passed through the Cyprus camps, having been taken off thirty-nine boats in their attempts to get to Palestine. Twenty-two hundred children who were born in the camps must be added to this number. Some of the detainees spent only a few months in Cyprus, but many were held there for a year and longer. Responsibility for setting up the camps and for their administration and security was of the British army in Cyprus, which handled the camps according to the rules applicable to prisoner-of-war camps. There were two kinds of camps. The “summer camps,” of which there were five, were located at Kraolos, near Famagusta, and the detainees in them were housed in tents. The seven “winter camps” were located at Dekalia, north of Larnaca. Here the housing consisted of tin huts and some tents. Conditions in the camps were quite harsh, especially for mothers of children and babies.\nLiving Conditions\nThe tents and barracks were overcrowded. There was no privacy, and families had to share accommodations with single persons. There were no partitions, no lighting fixtures, and no furniture except beds. The food supplied by the British army was of poor quality. Because of the inadequate facilities in the field kitchens, food was wasted and people went hungry. The detainees also suffered from a lack of clothing and shoes, which the British supplied only in limited quantities from army surplus. The insufficient supply of water, particularly in the hot summer months, caused sanitary conditions to deteriorate and led to skin diseases and infections. Most of the British officers and troops in charge of the camps carried out their duties indifferently or unwillingly. Those who wanted to ease the refugees’ lot for humanitarian reasons had little authority or resources.\nThe British administration in Palestine, which was charged with establishing and maintaining the camps, had to bear the costs out of its budget, which in any case showed a deficit, and it sought to put the responsibility for the welfare of the detainees on the Jewish Agency and the Joint Distribution Committee (also known as the Joint). This put the Jewish Agency in a dilemma. It did not recognise the legality of the detention, nor did it want to relieve the British authorities of their responsibility for the maintenance of the camps and the detainees’ state of health. The Agency therefore asked the Joint Distribution Committee to take on responsibility for the welfare of the camp population, which the Joint readily did. As early as September 1946, a few weeks after the camps were set up, the Joint was already engaged in welfare operations there, which they maintained throughout the camps’ existence.\nThe majority of the youngsters were put into one camp, Camp 65, which became a kind of youth village.\nThe Joint greatly reduced the hardships from which the refugees suffered. It recruited medical and welfare teams in Palestine to run nurseries and clinics in the camps, it improved the quality of food rations for those in special need and supplemented the basic food supplies of the general camp population, it catered to religious requirements, and it set up a bureau for the search of missing relatives. The provision of educational facilities for the children and teenagers (of whom there were large numbers in the camps, most having been orphaned in the Holocaust) was yet another task taken on by the Joint, in partnership with Youth Aliya. The majority of the youngsters were put into one camp, Camp 65, which became a kind of youth village. There, Youth Aliya educational teams established a school system based on the few teachers found among the refugees.\nThe welfare teams recruited in Palestine included Jewish Agency appointed emissaries of various political movements. Morris Laub, the Joint’s director in Cyprus, became the spokesman and representative of the detainees vis-א-vis the British authorities on the island. The detainees in the Cyprus camps were relatively young, with 80 percent of them between the ages of thirteen and thirty-five. Thus, they were among the more spirited and lively survivors of the Holocaust. They came to the camps as members of youth movements, immigration groups, and political parties imbued with a strong Zionist ideology. Their ideology and self-discipline enabled them to adapt to the conditions in the camps. In addition to being deprived of their liberty and exposed to harsh physical conditions, the detainees also suffered greatly from the enforced idleness of the camps. Efforts to keep them busy with cultural activities met with difficulties, owing to lack of means and scarcity of qualified personnel.\nAn important contribution was made by emissaries from Palestine who lived with the refugees in the camps. Some of these were “legal”: representatives of the various Zionist movements, welfare workers under Joint auspices, and teachers dispatched to Cyprus by the Rutenberg Teachers’ Seminary. Others were “illegal”: they were sent to Cyprus by the Palmah, the underground strike force of the Hagana (the Yishuv’s underground military organization), to provide the young people in the camps with military training and prepare them for service with the Hagana when they arrived in Palestine. Living among the detainees and sharing their lot, these emissaries had great influence. They represented the Jewish national institutions and were the link between the refugees and the Jewish population in Palestine.\nA few of the refugees who had second thoughts applied to the British authorities to return to the country from which they had set out. But generally, despite all their suffering, the Cyprus detainees displayed impressive moral strength and staying power during their internment. Though there were no written laws and no real sanctions that could have been applied, not a single criminal act was recorded among the detainees.\nEscape attempts\nA number of escape attempts took place while the camps were active. The most significant was in August 1948, when an estimated 100 inmates escaped a detention camp via a secret tunnel the British believed had been dug over a period of six months. The British believed that the escapees were being met by Jewish representatives in Cyprus, and “selected male specialists” among the refugees were being put on small boats capable of reaching Israel in 24 hours, which were being brought to Cyprus at night. Some 29 refugees were arrested over the incident and given prison sentences ranging from four to nine months. One man managed to escape while being transported from court to prison. In January 1949, as the British began deporting the final batch of inmates to Israel, an unspecified number of Jews who had escaped the camps and had remained at large in Cyprus turned themselves in so they could be sent to Israel. In February 1949, the evacuation of the camps officially ended, although some families and individuals remained in Cyprus until November 1949 due to health reasons or because they had young babies.\nImmigration quota system\nFrom November 1946 to the time of the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948, Cyprus detainees were allowed into Palestine at a rate of 750 people per month. During 1947-48, special quotas were given to pregnant women, nursing mothers, and the elderly. Released Cyprus detainees amounted to 67% of all immigrants to Palestine during that period. Following Israeli independence, the British began deporting detainees to Israel at a rate of 1,500 per month. They amounted to 40% of all immigration to Israel during the war months of May–September 1948. The British kept about 11,000 detainees, mainly men of military age, imprisoned throughout most of the war. On January 24, 1949, the British began sending these detainees to Israel, with the last of them departing for Israel on February 11, 1949.\nCOMMENT\nI had the opportunity to meet and speak with a retired soldier who had served in the operation, this was around 2008, over 60 years later, yet this old man was riddled with guilt. He told me that they would arrive on the shores of Palestine, as it was then and indiscriminately round them up and throw them on to the ships, where they were brought to Cyprus and then thrown in to camps, just as the Germans had been doing up to 1945.\nThese people did not know what would happen to them, they did not know if they were just being deported, detained, or if they were going to be executed. Considering what had happened over the previous decade, any assurances that they would not be hurt, would not have been very reassuring.",

Most concerningly, he cautioned that millions of British households could find themselves subject to a “postcode lottery” regarding their energy costs.\nThe controversy emerges amid heated discussions within the energy sector concerning the Government’s proposed implementation of a zonal pricing market—a system whereby different regions across the country would operate with distinct electricity prices, determined by localised supply and demand dynamics.\nUnder the current framework, the UK maintains a unified national electricity price. However, critics of this system, including prominent energy supplier Octopus Energy, contend that this arrangement artificially inflates bills across the board, as grid operators must resort to costly interventions—such as compensating wind farms to cease operations at certain times—to maintain system balance.\nProponents of the zonal system present the argument that such an approach would create natural incentives for developers to construct wind and solar farms in closer proximity to centres of demand, particularly near industrial zones and urban areas. They maintain that this would significantly reduce the requirement for extensive cabling infrastructure, ultimately resulting in cost savings for consumers.\nHowever, Phillips-Davies has emphasised that Miliband’s clean power initiative necessitates “post-war levels of infrastructure development and great feats of engineering”—all of which he believes would be fundamentally compromised should the Government proceed with the proposed reforms.\nThis warning coincides with the National Infrastructure Commission’s call for a substantial upgrade to the nation’s electricity distribution grids, anticipating a doubling of power demand by 2050. Government ministers have received advisement that investment requirements could reach as high as £50 billion.\nIn his contribution to The Telegraph, Phillips-Davies articulated his position: “The clean power prize represents a golden economic opportunity for Britain that is achievable without this costly distraction—don’t blow it now.”\nThe SSE chief executive further argued that the zonal reforms would require until at least 2032 for implementation, thereby potentially undermining the Energy Secretary’s stated ambition to achieve a clean power system by 2030. Phillips-Davies expressed particular concern that the policy would escalate the costs associated with the energy transition, as wind farm developers, including SSE, would need to pursue higher returns to offset the uncertainties introduced by zonal pricing.\nTo underscore his point, Phillips-Davies referenced SSE’s recent cancellation of plans to expand its Blairidh onshore wind farm, situated in Scotland’s Great Glen. He attributed this decision directly to the “risk premium” associated with zonal pricing, which rendered the project financially unviable.\nThe executive’s intervention highlights the complex predicament confronting Miliband regarding electricity market reform, with stakeholders on both sides of the debate warning of severe repercussions.\nMiliband’s ambitious plan to transition the power grid to almost complete reliance on renewable energy by 2030 necessitates substantial new wind and solar capacity. However, these installations frequently need to be situated far from urban centres, requiring extensive new cable infrastructure to connect them to the grid.\nFurthermore, congestion within the electricity transmission system—the vital network of cables that distributes power throughout the country—means that significant amounts of power generated by Scottish wind farms often cannot reach areas of highest demand in the south.\nThis situation compels grid operators to “balance” the system through measures such as shutting down Scottish wind farms whilst activating gas plants, batteries, or alternative generators in the south. Critics maintain that the national pricing system exacerbates these inefficiencies.\nAdvocates of zonal pricing assert that transitioning to a regional system would provide an immediate solution to these challenges. Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus Energy, has previously asserted that implementing a zonal system represents the only viable path for Miliband to deliver on Labour’s commitment to reduce domestic energy bills.\n“The choice is clear: without system reform, bills increase; with reform, they decrease,” Jackson stated last month.\nHowever, opponents, including SSE, advocate for increased government investment in grid upgrades and reforms that would address the peculiarities of the national pricing system without fragmenting it.\nPhillips-Davies reinforced this position, stating: “Zonal pricing would not address the fundamental realities of energy infrastructure. Large-scale wind and solar farms simply cannot be constructed within urban centres.”\nIn a parallel development, the National Infrastructure Commission has called for investment ranging between £37 billion and £50 billion in Britain’s electricity distribution grids to accommodate the projected doubling of power demand by 2050. Such investment would translate to an additional £5 to £25 on annual household bills.\nNick Winser, one of the report’s authors and an electricity markets expert, argued that higher bills to fund infrastructure investment would prove more economical for consumers in the long term, as it would diminish the need for more expensive interventions to address grid congestion in the future.\nIn response to these developments, a government spokesperson stated: “In an increasingly unstable world, guaranteeing our energy security and protecting consumers from future energy price shocks can only be achieved through transitioning to home-grown power sources. We are currently evaluating reforms to Britain’s electricity market arrangements, ensuring these prioritise bill payer protection and encourage investment. We shall provide an update in due course.”",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-broken-windows-theory/content_779.html": "The Broken Windows Theory\nDoes Disorder Really Cause Crime?\nThe broken windows theory has profoundly shaped policing and crime prevention strategies since the 1980s. But does this popular theory really hold up to empirical scrutiny? Let’s take a deeper dive into the evidence behind this influential concept.\nUnderstanding the Broken Windows Theory\nFirst proposed by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in 1982, the broken windows theory suggests that visible signs of disorder like broken windows, graffiti, and loitering create an environment that encourages further disorder and more serious crimes.\nThe theory uses the metaphor of broken windows to illustrate how neighborhoods can decline. If a building has a few broken windows that go unrepaired, soon vandals will break a few more windows. Eventually they may even break into the building if the owners seem not to care about the disorder.\nSimilarly, the theory argues that disorder sends a signal that communities are not in control. If one person breaks windows or commits other misdemeanor crimes without consequences, it can create a perception that deviant behavior is acceptable, leading to more disorder and serious criminal acts.\nThe broken windows theory states that by eliminating visible signs of disorder through stricter enforcement of minor offenses like vandalism, public drinking, panhandling, and fare evasion, communities can establish law-abiding norms and prevent serious crime from taking root. The idea is that disorder does not inevitably lead to serious crime, but ignoring disorder makes it more likely to occur.\nBroken Windows Policing in New York City\nThe broken windows theory had an enormous impact on policing practices in the 1990s that in many ways still continues today. It became closely associated with the “zero tolerance” policing strategies adopted by the New York City Police Department (NYPD).\nWhen William Bratton became head of the New York City Transit Police in 1990, he focused on cracking down on subway fare evasion and other low-level offenses. As these arrests increased, felonies in the subway dropped dramatically. Bratton was appointed NYPD Commissioner in 1994 and introduced his famous “quality of life initiative” based on the broken windows theory.\nThis initiative had police aggressively enforce laws against activities like public drinking, graffiti painting, aggressive panhandling, and street prostitution that were seen as disorderly and dangerous. The initiative cracked down on the infamous squeegee men who cleaned car windows at traffic intersections without permission. The NYPD also conducted many stop-and-frisk searches for weapons.\nDuring Bratton’s tenure, felony crime in New York declined significantly each year. The city’s murder rate alone dropped by 50 percent. Bratton gave credit to broken windows policing, though experts also pointed to factors like new computerized tracking systems, a strong economy, and changing drug markets.\nAfter Bratton’s departure in 1996, the broken windows approach continued influencing NYPD’s policing under successors like Commissioner William Safir. Though crime rates rose modestly in the early 2000s, New York retained its status as one of the safest large cities in America.\nThe allures of the broken windows theory—that it provided a simple solution to crime that did not require major social reform—made it immensely appealing to policymakers. Cracking down on minor disorder offenses was an easy and relatively inexpensive strategy compared to addressing broader socioeconomic problems.\nCriticisms of the Broken Windows Theory\nWhile it strongly shaped policing practices in New York and across the U.S., the broken windows theory has drawn many criticisms from researchers questioning its scientific validity.\nOne issue is that there is limited empirical evidence showing a direct link between physical and social disorder and serious crime rates when other key factors are controlled for. Critics argued the theory made assumptions to link disorder and crime without proving causation.\nCriminologist Ralph Taylor examined the connections between specific disorderly behaviors and crimes. He found no consistent pattern showing that visible signs of disorder directly caused higher rates of crime in neighborhoods. The relationships were erratic, suggesting that disorder may sometimes contribute to crime but does not inherently cause it.\nSociologist Robert Sampson studied factors like poverty and instability and concluded that any connection between disorder and crime is likely spurious. His research found that both disorder and certain crimes like assault tend to be byproducts of similar neighborhood conditions like concentrated disadvantage.\nPolitical scientist Bernard Harcourt reanalyzed data frequently cited by broken windows proponents and found that the link between disorder and serious crime disappeared when poverty, instability, and race were accounted for. The only connection that remained was between disorder and robbery victimization.\nHarcourt concluded that disorder was likely a symptom rather than cause of crime rates, as impoverished areas tend to have higher levels of both. He argued the theory wrongly emphasized punitive measures instead of addressing economic inequality and social marginalization.\nGeorge Kelling, co-creator of broken windows, responded to criticisms by stating the theory does not argue that disorder directly causes serious crime in all cases. Rather, it suggests ignoring disorder makes conditions more favorable for crime by sending a message of indifference. The theory acknowledges that factors like poverty also contribute to crime.\nDebates About Discriminatory Enforcement\nCritics of broken windows policing also argued it encouraged discriminatory enforcement that disproportionately targeted marginalized groups like the homeless, the mentally ill, youth of color, and LGBTQ individuals.\nIn New York City, police made hundreds of thousands of stops and frisks annually that critics argued were often based on racial profiling rather than reasonable suspicion of crimes. Over 80 percent of those stopped were African American or Latino. Data showed relatively few stops uncovered guns or other contraband.\nThe intensive focus on minor offenses also led to accusations that the NYPD was criminalizing homelessness, mental illness, and poverty rather than addressing their root causes. Courts ruled measures like the ban on sleeping in public places violated constitutional rights.\nCivil rights organizations alleged broken windows policing created an atmosphere encouraging excessive use of force in encounters stemming from minor offenses. Several notorious cases of NYPD brutality like the deaths of Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima occurred during broken windows crackdowns.\nProponents counter that the broken windows theory does not require discriminatory practices. They argue it can be implemented fairly by focusing on neighborhoods and behaviors exhibiting high levels of disorder rather than targeting specific groups. The theory’s creators expressed concerns that it was being applied overly harshly and punitively.\nDebates Over the Causes of New York’s Crime Drop\nThere are also disagreements about how much credit broken windows policing deserves for New York City’s dramatic crime declines of the 1990s.\nThe extent to which aggressive order maintenance caused this drop remains debated, as crime rates also fell nationally during this period. Some experts attribute New York’s crime decline primarily to other factors:\n– Demographic shifts that reduced the number of males most prone to criminal behavior\n– An aging population less likely to commit crimes\n– Improvements in employment opportunities\n– Advances in policing strategies and technology\n– Decreases in crack cocaine use\n– Gun buyback programs that reduced access to firearms\n– Increases in the prison population that incapacitated repeat offenders\nCriminologists argue the crime drop likely stemmed from an array of social and policy changes, of which broken windows policing was one contributing factor but not necessarily the deciding one. The theory likely worked in tandem with other innovations in policing and corrections.\nCurrent Status of Broken Windows Theory\nWhile debates around the broken windows theory continue, it maintains strong support among many policymakers and remains influential in policing.\nNonetheless, some departments are pulling back from strict broken windows strategies as concerns grow about over-ticketing and alienating communities. The COVID-19 pandemic also made aggressively enforcing low-level offenses difficult and unsafe.\nIn New York, recent political shifts have led to reforms reversing aspects of broken windows policing. Current Mayor Eric Adams has aimed to take a more balanced approach focused on addressing dangerous weapon offenses while diverting those with mental illness away from the criminal justice system.\nYet the theory continues impacting departments across the U.S. and globally. Baltimore, Los Angeles, and several European cities have implemented forms of broken windows policing. Skepticism remains among academics, but many officials consider the risks of under-enforcement to be greater than over-policing minor disorder.\nThe Ongoing Debate\nWhile the broken windows theory seemed to provide a simple solution to high crime rates, the reality remains complex and contested. There is strong evidence that visible signs of disorder generate fear and disinvestment in communities, even if the links to serious crime are less clear.\nThe theory’s appeal rests in its common-sense logic, though applying it in the real world has revealed many pitfalls. Eliminating discretion and mandating zero-tolerance enforcement can backfire if applied indiscriminately. Yet under-enforcement also carries risks if it allows disorder to fester.\nThere are still many open questions around this landmark theory that launched decades of debate and reform. Its core ideas will likely continue generating both enthusiasm and apprehension well into the future.\nWhat are your thoughts on the broken windows theory and the evidence for and against it? I’m interested to hear perspectives from both supporters and critics on this hotly debated concept.\nSummary of “The Broken Windows Theory: Does Disorder Really Cause Crime?”\nIntroduction to the Broken Windows Theory\n– Proposed by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in 1982.\n– Suggests that visible disorder encourages more serious crimes.\n– Uses the metaphor of broken windows to illustrate neighborhood decline.\nKey Concepts\n– Disorder signals a lack of community control.\n– Ignoring minor disorder makes serious crime more likely.\n– Stricter enforcement of minor offenses can establish law-abiding norms.\nImpact on Policing in New York City\n– Influenced “zero tolerance” policing in NYC in the 1990s.\n– Led to crackdowns on subway fare evasion and low-level offenses.\n– Crime rates, including murder, decreased significantly during this period.\nCriticisms of the Theory\n– Limited empirical evidence of a direct link between disorder and serious crime.\n– Some argue that disorder and crime are byproducts of similar neighborhood conditions.\n– Concerns that the theory encouraged discriminatory enforcement.\nDebates About New York’s Crime Drop\n– Debate over how much credit broken windows policing deserves for crime declines.\n– Other factors like demographics, employment, and drug use also contributed.\nCurrent Status\n– Strong support among policymakers and continued influence in policing.\n– Some departments are moving away from strict broken windows strategies.\n– Ongoing debate between over-policing and under-enforcement.\nConclusion\n– The theory’s appeal lies in its common-sense logic.\n– Still many open questions and ongoing debate about its effectiveness and implications.",

He cited the introduction of legislation on abortions, gender choice and the cohabitation of same sex-persons.\n“It is obvious that these laws aim at destroying not only the religious but also the national component of our people,” the prelate said.\nOn social media, Chrysostomos took flak for his views, as well as for the fact he omitted to make any mention of the number one issue on people’s minds these days – the Mitsero mine murders.\nCOMMENT\nWe MUST separate the politics from the people. I’m not getting in to who did what, because NOBODY is innocent, even those born after 1974 who refuse to hold out an Olive branch to their fellow Cypriots, are just as bad if not worse.\nThe Ledra street area of Nicosia has burst in to life since 2003, with a constant flow BOTH WAYS, money flowing BOTH WAYS, but I do not hear anyone walking around Ledra street protesting outside any shop that sells to those crossing from the other side to shop and trust me, spending happens both ways.\nWith regard to the politics, what has been learned from the past? On an official level….NOTHING! All we hear is complaints about Turkish flags and the Turkish army, but what have our leaders done to demonstrate their wish for a unified Cypriot state? Plaster every building with Greek flags! This is an insult to anyone who is truly proud to be Cypriot.\nWhat nation building steps has the ROC taken, to create a unified Cypriot state?\nIf we accept the notion that anyone with a Cypriot grandfather is Cypriot, whether they were born here or not (the official criteria to be obligated for national service or to apply for citizenship) then we must also accept that the number or Cypriots Nationals, including those eligible, living outside of Cyprus, is great than the number actually living here, with the vast majority by far living in English speaking countries, with children whose first language is English. Yet what did the ROC do to acknowledge those people? They actually REMOVED English as an official language, making them second class citizens.\nWhy are there no secular, English speaking state schools in every town, to encourage children of all backgrounds to learn, grow and bond together? Not a chance, so how do they expect people who have been raised in parallel societies to ever unite? There must be interaction, trade, nation building and sports if we are to create a nation out of the ashes that have been left by the sick fanatics who destroyed Cyprus and STILL insist on blaming everyone else for it! I have also noticed that those who seem to be the most hostile, don’t even live here!\nWhilst I do not agree with the way that Turkey is exploiting the situation, has anyone considered that many Cypriots living under Turkish occupation feel exactly the same? Personally, I know many who do. Even so, we must try to tentatively interact on many different levels and that means people from both sides crossing, I doubt very much that stopping to get a coffee or something to eat is something we should be stressing about and certainly, it is nothing to do with the Church.\nThe sooner Cyprus becomes a secular state, with bigoted hypocrites like this Ogre and his band of merry men, gagged and BANNED from commenting on anything political the better. I do not see him encouraging humanity, charity, education and respect…………..If he wants to cast aspersions, then he should start with the President who was actually defending the criminals of EOKA b’ or that same person who sanctioned the plundering of people’s bank accounts, or the endless list of corrupt officials……need I go on?",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-bradbury-pound-could-be-a-forgotten-solution-to-economic-woes/content_641.html": "The Bradbury Pound Could Be a Forgotten Solution to Economic Woes\nIn the annals of British financial history, there lies a curious footnote that some believe could hold the key to solving modern economic crises. This forgotten piece of fiscal ingenuity is known as the Bradbury Pound, an emergency currency introduced in the United Kingdom at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. As the nation teeters on the brink of yet another economic downturn, with talks of a £22 billion black hole in the budget, some are calling for a fresh look at this century-old monetary experiment.\nThe story of the Bradbury Pound begins on 4th August 1914, when Britain declared war on Germany. As news of the conflict spread, panic gripped the nation’s financial institutions. Citizens, fearing the worst, queued outside banks to withdraw their savings, threatening to deplete the gold reserves that underpinned the monetary system of the time. The Bank of England, a private institution despite its name, found itself in a precarious position, having issued more paper notes than it could back with actual gold.\nIn response to this looming crisis, the Treasury took an extraordinary step. Under the Bank Notes and Currency Act, hastily passed through Parliament in just two days, the Treasury was empowered to issue its own currency. These notes, which came to be known as Bradbury Pounds after Sir John Bradbury, the first Secretary to the Treasury who signed them, were not backed by gold but by the “wealth and labour potential of the country”.\nThis move effectively circumvented the Bank of England and the private banking system. The Bradbury Pounds were debt-free and interest-free, created by the government for the people. They were accepted everywhere, from high street banks to market stalls, and played a crucial role in stabilising the economy during the tumultuous early days of the war.\nHowever, the reign of the Bradbury Pound was short-lived. By 1917, the Treasury had reverted to borrowing money from the Bank of England at interest, a move that some argue laid the groundwork for the massive national debt we grapple with today.\nNow, over a century later, as the UK faces economic challenges that echo those of 1914, there are calls to revisit the principles behind the Bradbury Pound. Proponents argue that the government could, and should, create its own money based on the nation’s wealth, rather than borrowing from private banks at interest.\nThe concept is not without its critics. Mainstream economists warn of the potential for runaway inflation if money creation is not carefully controlled. However, supporters counter that the current system, where private banks create money through lending, is itself inflationary and prone to boom-and-bust cycles.\nAt the heart of this debate lies a fundamental question about the nature of money itself. Is it merely a convenient unit of exchange, or does it represent something more tangible? The Bradbury Pound was based on the idea that a nation’s currency should reflect its real wealth – its infrastructure, resources, and the productive capacity of its people.\nThis idea challenges the current global financial system, where central banks, including the Bank of England, coordinate their policies through institutions like the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. Critics argue that this system places the control of money creation in the hands of unelected, unaccountable entities that operate largely in secret.\nTo bring these issues to the fore, an open letter has been penned to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves. The letter poses four key questions about money creation and the relationship between the Treasury, the Bank of England, and international financial institutions.\nThe first question asks whether the Chancellor receives full briefings from the Governor of the Bank of England after his bimonthly meetings at the Bank for International Settlements. These meetings, where central bank governors from around the world gather to discuss global monetary policy, are conducted without formal minutes, raising questions about transparency and accountability.\nThe second question addresses the legal status of the City of London, the square mile at the heart of Britain’s financial district. Some economists argue that the City operates as a “state within a state”, with its own unique legal privileges. The letter asks how, if this is the case, the Bank of England can be allowed to control the nation’s finances from what is effectively foreign soil.\nThe third question delves into history, asking whether the Chancellor is aware of the events of 7th August 1914, when the Bradbury Pound was introduced. This question aims to gauge the government’s knowledge and understanding of alternative monetary policies that have been successfully implemented in the past.\nThe final and perhaps most crucial question asks whether, given the evidence presented, the Chancellor will consider expanding the money supply directly through the Treasury, effectively creating a modern version of the Bradbury Pound. This would involve bypassing the private banking system and creating debt-free, interest-free money based on the nation’s wealth.\nAdvocates for monetary reform are urging citizens to send this letter to their Members of Parliament, particularly targeting the 300-plus new MPs who may not yet be fully entrenched in the current system. The hope is to spark a debate in Parliament about monetary policy and the potential for sovereign money creation.\nHowever, critics of this approach argue that giving politicians direct control over money creation could lead to abuse and economic instability. They point to historical examples of hyperinflation in countries where governments have printed money without restraint.\nProponents counter that a properly structured system of sovereign money creation would include checks and balances to prevent such abuses. They suggest the creation of an independent body, separate from both the government and the banking sector, to oversee money creation based on the real needs of the economy.\nThe debate over monetary reform touches on fundamental questions about democracy, sovereignty, and the nature of wealth. In an era of growing wealth inequality and recurring financial crises, these questions are more pertinent than ever.\nAs the UK grapples with its economic challenges, the story of the Bradbury Pound serves as a reminder that alternative approaches to money and finance are possible. Whether such ideas will gain traction in the corridors of power remains to be seen, but the conversation itself is a valuable one, encouraging citizens to think critically about the financial systems that underpin our society.\nIn the end, the debate over the Bradbury Pound and sovereign money creation is not just about economics. It’s about the kind of society we want to create and the values we wish to prioritise. As we face the economic challenges of the 21st century, perhaps it’s time to look back to the innovations of the past for inspiration.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_ev-infrastructure-under-threat/content_1004.html": "EV infrastructure under threat\nBT Abandons Electric Vehicle Charging Point Initiative After Single Installation\nTelecommunications Giant Shifts Focus Following Limited Success of Street Cabinet Conversion Programme\nBritish Telecommunications (BT) has terminated its ambitious scheme to transform green street cabinets into electric vehicle (EV) charging points, having completed just one installation out of an initially proposed 60,000 conversions, marking a significant setback in the nation’s EV infrastructure development efforts.\nThe distinctive metal cabinets, which have become a familiar sight along British streets and are traditionally used to house telephone and broadband cables, were earmarked for an innovative repurposing project. When BT unveiled the initiative in January 2024, the telecommunications company heralded it as a “unique opportunity” to address what it identified as a “key barrier” preventing motorists from transitioning away from conventional petrol and diesel vehicles.\nHowever, the programme has now been discontinued, with BT announcing a strategic pivot towards addressing “the Wi-Fi connectivity challenge surrounding EVs” instead. This dramatic scaling back of ambitions has raised questions about the feasibility of rapid EV infrastructure expansion in residential areas.\nStuart Masson, an automotive industry expert from the specialist website The Car Expert, expressed disappointment about the scheme’s termination in his comments to BBC News. “It’s disappointing that it’s not going to proceed,” he noted, though he tempered this assessment with some optimistic industry observations. “The good news that we are seeing in the industry is that the overall rollout of electric charging points is accelerating faster than had been predicted a couple of years ago,” Masson added.\nNevertheless, Masson highlighted a crucial caveat: the majority of new charging points are being installed in high-traffic commercial areas rather than residential streets closer to people’s homes, making BT’s withdrawal from the cabinet conversion scheme particularly problematic for potential EV adopters without off-street parking.\nThe automotive expert did, however, welcome BT’s commitment to enhancing wi-fi infrastructure around EV charging locations. He elaborated on the current challenges: “It’s very frustrating when you turn up to a charging point, you go to log into the app… and you can’t get a connection because you’re buried in a multi-storey car park somewhere and there’s no signal. If BT can make a dent in that then that would be really good.”\nThe Sole Installation\nThe project’s only successful conversion was implemented in East Lothian, Scotland. This solitary charging point is now scheduled for decommissioning in February, according to The Fast Charge newsletter, which first reported the story. Currently, the charging point is listed as “out of order” on the Evve Charge application, which maps EV charging locations throughout the United Kingdom.\nEast Lothian Council responded to queries about the closure by emphasising the region’s robust existing charging infrastructure. A council spokesperson stated: “East Lothian has one of the highest numbers of electric vehicle chargers per head of population among Scotland’s local authorities, with more than 370 public places to plug in cars.”\nBT’s Perspective and Future Focus\nA BT Group spokesperson reflected on the trial’s outcomes, noting that it had revealed “a great deal about the challenges that many on-street EV drivers are facing with charging and where BT Group can add most value to the UK EV ecosystem.” They continued: “Other emerging needs we’ve identified include the wi-fi connectivity challenge surrounding EVs – our pilots will now shift in focus to explore this further.”\nNational Context and Government Targets\nThe government maintains an ambitious target of establishing 300,000 public charging points by 2030. Current official statistics indicate there are 73,334 public charging devices across the UK, representing a significant 37% increase compared to the previous year. However, the distribution remains notably uneven, with nearly a third of these facilities concentrated in Greater London, according to data from EV charging company Zapmap.\nIndustry Challenges and Government Response\nThe Department for Transport responded to BT’s announcement by highlighting recent achievements, stating that 2024 was “a record-breaking year for EV infrastructure,” with approximately 20,000 new charging points installed over the past twelve months. “This comes alongside £6bn of private investment in the pipeline by 2030, helping EV owners drive with the confidence that they will never be too far away from a chargepoint,” the department affirmed.\nHowever, the automotive industry has expressed reservations about the pace of the UK’s EV transition. Ford Motor Company voiced concerns in November 2024 regarding the government’s timetable for phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles, suggesting that additional financial incentives would be necessary for successful implementation.\nIn response to these industry concerns, the government initiated a consultation process with automotive and charging infrastructure stakeholders in December to refine its strategy for phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles. The government emphasised its £2.3 billion investment commitment to support the transition to EVs, while reaffirming its target to end sales of new fossil fuel-powered vehicles by 2030.\nThe termination of BT’s cabinet conversion scheme highlights the complex challenges facing the UK’s EV infrastructure development, even as the country pursues its ambitious environmental and transportation goals. While alternative charging solutions continue to emerge, the need for innovative approaches to residential charging infrastructure remains a significant hurdle in the nation’s journey toward widespread EV adoption.\nSummary\n* BT has cancelled its plan to convert green street cabinets into EV charging points after installing only one out of a planned 60,000 units:\n– The only installation was in East Lothian, Scotland\n– This single unit will be decommissioned in February\n– The charger is currently listed as “out of order” on the Evve Charge app\n* Current state of UK EV charging infrastructure:\n– 73,334 public charging devices currently available\n– 37% increase compared to previous year\n– Nearly one-third concentrated in Greater London\n– Government target is 300,000 charging points by 2030\n– Nearly 20,000 new points added in past 12 months\n* BT’s revised focus:\n– Shifting attention to “Wi-Fi connectivity challenge surrounding EVs”\n– Aims to improve internet connectivity at charging locations\n– Cites learnings about on-street EV charging challenges\n* Industry perspective and challenges:\n– Overall rollout of charging points is exceeding earlier predictions\n– Most new installations are in busy areas rather than residential streets\n– Ford raised concerns about EV transition timeline in November 2024\n– Government launched consultation with automotive industry about petrol/diesel car phase-out\n* Government response and investment:\n– £6 billion of private investment expected by 2030\n– £2.3 billion government investment committed to support EV switch\n– Maintains target to end new petrol/diesel car sales by 2030\n– Consulting with automotive and charging industries on transition plans",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_what-i-stand-for/content_434.html": "What I stand for\nTaking the brave step to stand for public office is something that I have been deliberating with for a long time, because I have increasingly felt a greater disconnection with the two mainstream parties that have been consistently in control of Government. However, in the UK, the political system is set up in such a way that it is very difficult for any new party to break in the establishment, but that does not mean that change cannot be enforced in a different manner.\nBased on the results of the last election, there are or were currently 67 marginal seats in the UK, however based on the figures of the election prior to that, when Theresa May was re-elected after giving away her majority for no reason (or was there?) when there were 97 marginal seats.\nAs we all know in the election of 2019, the Brexit party targeted all the marginal seats, which could have won them the balance of power, this strategy was so effective, it forced the incoming prime minister (Boris Johnson) to take them seriously and basically agree to push ahead with Brexit.\nThe last fifteen years of government has been a shambles, all the way back to the financial crisis of 2008, although the roots of that crisis were as a direct result of the actions of banks over the previous decade to that, so in reality, the mismanagement extends backwards at least twenty five years, during successive governments across the political divide. This is not an issue of Labour or Conservative, they are equally to blame and directing the anger with one, to vote for the other is the exact form of ‘YoYo Politics’ that they have come to rely on, or indeed exploit.\nAs voters or citizens, we have been slowly indoctrinated to be divided along party or political lines, a strategy that has been used throughout history to exercise control and I really do believe that people have never been as polarised as they are now, on so many issues.\nI also fervently believe that in a society where our freedom is being eroded at an alarming rate, it is incumbent upon us to act quickly, while we still can, because the steps that are being taken in other parts of the country, which are increasingly restricting people, will invariably reach our door in the future.\nIt is against this background, that I have decided to take the step to stand for the most difficult if not impossible seat in the country, one that has never had an independent MP, in fact, no independent has even received enough votes to recover their deposit, but that is no reason not to stand.\nWhat is you thoughts on our Judaeo Christian background?\nAlthough I can’t say that I am extremely religious, I do have faith and respect for being judged. I have great respect for our faith and its history. I am very concerned about the trivialisation of our faith, it is not about whether Lot’s wife did or did not turn into a pillar of salt, it is the inherent morals that are embedded into our society that are being questioned.\nWhilst we should respect other faiths, we should not forget to maintain respect for our own.\nTY for your reply Antony, so good to have met you on Wednesday Evening.\n7,010 votes is very good, keep in there. We desperately need people like you with a good brain and understanding of Ai. I hope we can meet up again or maybe go to Parliament together, feel free to email me.",

The move came after mounting pressure from the Prime Minister and Chancellor, who expressed “significant concerns” over the situation. NatWest, in which the government holds a substantial stake, now faces a full-blown crisis, with calls for the entire board to step down. Let’s delve into the details of what transpired and the implications for the bank and the wider financial sector.\nThe Scandal Unfolds:\nThe crisis began when Dame Alison Rose confessed to being the source behind the leaking of a customer’s financial details related to Nigel Farage’s bank account closure. Initially, she tried to retain her £5 million per year position despite the admission, but the situation escalated rapidly. The Prime Minister and Chancellor’s intervention triggered her resignation in the early hours of the morning.\nPolitical Fallout and Public Outcry:\nAmidst the scandal, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage spoke out against NatWest and urged the entire board to resign, accusing the bank of endorsing a divisive culture that lacks true diversity and inclusion. Notably, some senior Tories sided with Farage, criticizing NatWest’s handling of the situation and calling for accountability.\nMarket Impact:\nThe fallout from the controversy had immediate repercussions on NatWest’s stock, with share prices plummeting by 3% in early trading. Additionally, other banks, including Lloyds, were also affected despite reporting increased half-year profits.\nLessons for the Financial Sector:\nCity minister Andrew Griffith emphasized the importance of serving customers fairly and without imposing personal views on their beliefs. The incident served as a wake-up call for the financial sector to review its practices and ensure that politically motivated decisions are avoided in the future.\nNatWest’s Leadership Transition:\nWith Dame Alison Rose stepping down, NatWest’s board announced that Paul Thwaite, the current chief executive of the company’s Commercial and Institutional business, would take over her responsibilities for an initial period of 12 months, pending regulatory approval. The board will conduct a further process to appoint a permanent successor in due course.\nConclusion:\n– NatWest’s Chief Executive, Dame Alison Rose, resigned from her position amid a scandal involving the ‘de-banking’ of Nigel Farage.\n– She admitted briefing the BBC about the closure of Farage’s bank account, leading to a leak of customer financial details.\n– Pressure from the Prime Minister and Chancellor resulted in her resignation.\n– Calls for the entire board to step down followed from both political figures and senior Tories.\n– NatWest’s stock fell by 3% in early trading due to the controversy, affecting other banks as well.\n– City minister Andrew Griffith emphasized the importance of fair customer service and avoiding politically motivated decisions in the financial sector.\n– Paul Thwaite will take over as interim CEO, pending regulatory approval, with a permanent successor to be appointed later.\n– The incident highlights the need for integrity and accountability within the financial industry, with lessons for other institutions to uphold fair and inclusive banking practices.\nThe ‘de-banking’ scandal surrounding NatWest and Nigel Farage has sent shockwaves through the financial industry. Dame Alison Rose’s resignation highlights the need for greater integrity and accountability within the sector. As the bank navigates through this crisis, it remains crucial for the leadership to rebuild trust with customers, shareholders, and the public at large. Additionally, this incident should serve as a cautionary tale for other financial institutions, reminding them of their responsibility to uphold fair and inclusive banking practices, irrespective of customers’ political beliefs. Only time will tell how this saga will unfold and what lasting impact it will have on NatWest and the broader financial landscape.\nThis woman is guilty of one of some serious offences, including grounds for a lawsuit against her by Nigel Farage, as she has admitted what she did, but more seriously, she breached GDPR and Coutts are also guilty, she is not on the board of Coutts, so how did she have any information about Nigel Farage in the first place?\nThis may well result in prosecutions for all concerned.\nThis woman is guilty of one of some serious offences, including grounds for a lawsuit against her by Nigel Farage, as she has admitted what she did, but more seriously, she breached GDPR and Coutts are also guilty, she is not on the board of Coutts, so how did she have any information about Nigel Farage in the first place?\nThis may well result in prosecutions for all concerned.",

We frequently hear about people posting photos and then removing them if they do not get enough ‘likes’ which is a clear sign of the emotional immaturity that has been nurtured in recent years.\nWe are now living in the greatest climate ever for most people, never in the history of humanity have so many people had so many opportunities and such a high quality of life, (many do not of course) but it seems that those in the most privileged of positions, are the ones who are most emotionally and psychologically imbalanced.\nIs this all by chance?

Nor can it be used as a general power to extend time.\nThe Article 50 period is set at 2 years unless, as provided for in Article 50 “the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend [it]”.\nSo the version put out by the civil servants was false. The differences in meaning between the two versions were considerable.\nSo the civil servants responsible for briefing parliament to enable an informed debate to take place, themselves were misleading it. The alteration of the text of Article 50, and of the proviso to paragraph 3, must have been deliberate.\nThis is a truly alarming state of affairs; it should be exposed sooner rather than later.\nCONCLUSIONS\nStating the outcome shortly, it would seem to be as follows:\n(i) The application by the Prime Minister for an extension of time until June 30th under the proviso to Article 50, made on or about the 14th March 2019, was legally valid, but was rejected by the EU.\n(ii) This was followed by the Agreement proposed by the EU. It did not comply with the terms of the proviso; nor was Article 50 referred to or relied on by the EU. It was not effective to stop the Article 50 process running up to and including the 29th March at 11 p.m. Whichever way one looks at it, the Agreement was either unlawful or made for an unlawful purpose or ultra vires .That means that the UK left the EU on the 29th March 2019 by default as there was no valid or lawful impediment to prevent it.\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvVQwt-vNJ4?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0]\nCOMMENT\nThis should come as no surprise to anyone who has taken an objective view of the entire EU experiment. The British public were led in the EEC with lies, by Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, because they knew that the people would not support the real agenda behind joining.\nWe were lied to again and again, whilst the political classes pushed ahead with their agenda for ever closer union, in total contempt of the people.\nRead the full article written by Stanley Brodie QC\nCan we have our money back then?\nHopefully Robin Tilbrooks current Legal case in support of the above will be heard at the High Court and prove that we are already out of the EU. I do not hold my breath though because of our biased PRO EU Judiciary at the top.\nHow can these other cases be heard and decided immediately and the Tillbrook case is taking so long\nWhy has NO ONE in the Common, or even one MP/MEP mentioned this case there is no doubt they ALL know about are they trying to betray the British people again hoping that if they don’t acknowledge it doesn’t exist, WHAT will happen IF and it’s a big if we actually get a court date and a miracle happens that we don’t get a remain/bias judge who states that we have left on 29th March 2019???\nI don’t get why this man isn’t shouting it from the roof tops. He’s in a position to put it right and let every single person in this country know this important information and he could have backed up Robin Tillbrook in his plight to prove the same. He’s also in a high up position to get on national TV news and let everyone know. I get so mad when i happen to stumble onto stuff like this ’cause I know it was only by accident that I saw it which makes me think not many other people will see this so won’t know about it, gggrrrrrr.\nThis sounds very plausible, amazing even, but is It CORRECT. Who is telling the truth, How many times has the legal position changed, who can we believe? How many QC’S does it take to CHANGE A LOOPHOLE?\nIf this is THE LEGAL RULING TELL EVERYONE!.\nI agree, I have noticed that some of my articles and posts mysteriously vanish when they are too close to the mark, and I was recently blocked by FB for a week, when I shared a video of Tony Blair talking rubbish. I would really appreciate those with a legal background to look in to this and let us know what the position is, they have successfully divided a nation with their scare tactics. The choice was leave or remain, not leave but only with a deal, we all voted to leave and the deal would come by itself, it would have to, Europe is in crisis and Germany is on the verge of economic collapse.\nThey lied to the nation to take us in, they are lying to keep us in and George Soros, the perpetrator of ‘thriving under chaos’ has actually donated FIVE HUNDRED MILLION to support the remain movement! That says it all!\nIf we have left why the mp saying we haven’t so how can Boris go to jail to say no deal??\nShould this situation be legal fact undisbutable, then why are we pursuing any further with an agreement.\nSo why are we still negotiating with the EU if this is correct by default ,and why is our judicial system not agreeing with this and interfering with government policies? As a lay person you cannot have one law for one person and not everyone!! Or am I stupid,,\nThis fact was taken to court by the British Democrats and thrown out as no case to answer or a similar reason.\nIf this article is correct, it means our courts are totally corrupt and most certainly not independent.\nI have just read article 61,find it on Google, see what everyone thinks\nIt had Absolutely Nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher, SIMPLES\nWhy o why is this not made public and legally perused by the Tory’s just make sure they don’t get that Scottish idiot judge\nYes we certainly were lied to in the 70’s,we believed the treaty was for common market of goods,primarily foodstuffs….we were shown no information about union of countries governments,superstate,taxing proposals,or anything else.\nWho are the law makers – very confused with the. All\nThe refusal by the establishment to accept this, with them trying to stifle discussion by blocking the Robin Tilbrook case, is scary and infuriating in equal measure.\nI am in touch with Robin Tilbrook who, as you will probably know is trying again to get it through court. I recantly read about article 61,would this help us?\nThat’s really interesting Betty, my fear is that people like him are at risk if they speak out, but it would be wonderful to hear more from him. Thank you\nWhy is it remain’s court cases get heard and decisions made immediately yet the Brexit one seems to be dragging along like a ton weight? Is there no way we can get a decision from impartial or non EU funded judges? It seems dreadful that our laws are being broken and bent by remain MPs with impunity, whilst those same lawbreakers claim they are doing it to prevent Boris breaking laws which don’t seem to exist? It’s corrupt, despicable and an affront to the people of this country.\nI agree, this is almost our last bastion of freedom, they are desperate to thwart our desire to leave, because it will signal the end of the EU. If we capitulate now, it will be the end. The Lisbon treaty will dictate what we can and can’t do soon and it will actually be illegal for us to even want to leave in the not too distant future. The EU is a political Frankenstein that threatens us all, if we allow them to get away with this, it will still fall apart one day, but not peacefully.\nWe must stand up to this political corruption!\nThis is disgusting\nState of play- proceeding slowly, but bound to succeed.\nhttp://casetracker.justice.gov.uk/getDetail.do?case_id=20191534",

Unlike the terrible-twins, comprising of the Conservatives who have disillusioned the voting public and Labour, who are terrifying them with their lack of any policies, therefore we are best placed to offer a different option to the people of the UK.\nNorthampton has suffered from a decaying town centre, housing shortages in every area, first-time buyers, affordable housing, private rental and social housing, increasing crime and lack of investment across the board.\nIn recent weeks, we have seen an unprecedented exodus of Conservative MPs, which even surpasses the numbers we saw back in 1997. Even the local MP for Northampton North, Sir Michael Ellis is standing down after 14 years, despite having a large majority at the last election, this is nothing if not an indictment of the current administration, which has been a disappointment to the British people, by demonstrating their loyalty to globalism, corporations and those who have no right to interfere in our country.\nWe have unsustainable numbers arriving legally and illegally, costing the money large sums that it cannot afford to spend.\nFor years, I have campaigned for awareness of ‘Claire’s Law’ in order to reduce the number of women(mainly) who are victims of domestic abuse, by allowing them to request a police search for a history of violence, when they meet a new partner, however, as 8% of our population has arrived within the last 5 years, how on earth are the police able to determine if there is any history of violence, if they know nothing about so many people?\nIt is all well and good to ‘ride the political narrative’ but there are consequences and in recent years, we have seen that those consequences are all too often very sinister.\nI and the other candidates will be happy to answer questions honestly, and your attendance would be greatly appreciated, after all, what matters most here is Democracy and for it to function, the participation of the public is required.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_evidence-that-palestine-was-never-a-nation/content_107.html": "Evidence that Palestine was never a nation\nThe Myth of a Historical Palestinian State\nFor decades, there has been ongoing debate and conflict surrounding Israel and the Palestinian territories. Despite the prevalence of this issue in global discourse, many individuals in the West protesting on the streets lack a comprehensive understanding of the region’s intricate history. It is crucial to examine the facts and delve into the historical context to unravel the truth about the notion of a Palestinian state.\nThe Roots of the Conflict\nThe origins of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be traced back to the early 20th century when the British Empire played a pivotal role in shaping the region’s political landscape. In 1917, the Balfour Declaration expressed Britain’s support for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. This declaration was a significant milestone, as it acknowledged the historical and cultural ties between the Jewish diaspora and the land of Palestine.\nHowever, the British Empire’s subsequent actions sowed the seeds of discord and laid the foundation for the ongoing conflict. In 1922, a critical decision was made to divide the territory designated for the Jewish National Home. The region known as Transjordan, comprising approximately 77% of the original mandate, was severed from the Jewish homeland and allocated to the Arab population.\nThe Maps Tell the Story\nHistorical maps provide a visual representation of the shifting borders and territorial allocations during this tumultuous period. The 1919 map of the British Mandate Jewish National Home clearly illustrates the intended boundaries of the Jewish homeland, encompassing both sides of the Jordan River. This territory, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Desert, was destined to become the reconstituted Jewish National Home, as promised in the Balfour Declaration.\nHowever, the 1922 Mandate for Palestine significantly altered this plan. The map from this period depicts a stark division, with the white area on the left representing what would largely become modern-day Israel, including the Gaza Strip and the majority of the West Bank. Conversely, the yellow section on the right, known as Transjordan, was designated as the Arab portion of the Palestinian territories, effectively prohibiting Jewish settlement in this region.\nThe Two-State Solution and Its Failure\nThe allocation of Transjordan to the Arab population was initially intended as a two-state solution, providing a homeland for both the Jewish and Arab populations. Ironically, while Jewish settlement was prohibited in Transjordan, Arab populations were not barred from residing within the Jewish territory, which later became Israel. This disparity has contributed to the ongoing tensions and claims of injustice from both sides.\nDespite the initial agreement on the two-state solution, the subsequent rejection of this plan by various parties fueled further conflict. Calls for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state “from the river to the sea” emerged, undermining the very premise of the two-state solution and perpetuating the cycle of violence and instability.\nThe Golan Heights and the Expansion of Israeli Sovereignty\nIn more recent times, the United States’ recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights in March 2019 further reshaped the territorial landscape. This decision effectively consolidated Israeli control over the strategic Golan Heights region, which had been a contested area since the Six-Day War in 1967.\nConsequently, the map of the region has undergone significant transformations, with the West Bank now appearing significantly larger than its original allocated territory. This expansion has fueled accusations from Palestinian groups of land encroachment and a disregard for the principles of the two-state solution.\nThe Elusive Quest for Peace\nDespite numerous attempts at peace negotiations and international interventions, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most intractable and complex issues in the modern era. The crux of the matter lies in the divergent historical narratives and deeply rooted claims to the land from both sides.\nProponents of the Palestinian cause often assert that Palestine has been an Islamic country for centuries, and the establishment of Israel represents an illegal occupation and theft of their rightful homeland. However, historical evidence suggests that prior to the mid-20th century, there was no distinct Palestinian state, flag, president, prime minister, or sovereign entity that could lay claim to the land.\nIn contrast, the Jewish people trace their ancestral roots and cultural heritage to the land of Israel, dating back thousands of years. The creation of the modern state of Israel in 1948 is seen as a reclamation of their historical homeland and a fulfillment of the Zionist aspiration for a secure and sovereign Jewish state.\nReconciling these divergent narratives and addressing the complex issues of borders, security, and the rights of both populations remains a formidable challenge. However, it is essential to acknowledge and understand the historical context and the motivations of all parties involved to forge a path towards a just and lasting resolution.\nConclusion\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a multifaceted and deeply rooted issue that defies simplistic narratives or one-sided approaches. While emotions and ideological stances often fuel the rhetoric surrounding this conflict, it is imperative to approach the matter with an objective and fact-based understanding of the region’s complex history.\nBy examining the maps, territorial allocations, and the evolving political landscapes of the past century, a more nuanced picture emerges. The notion of a historical Palestinian state with defined borders, governance, and sovereignty prior to the mid-20th century is not supported by evidence. Instead, the region was subject to shifting boundaries and competing claims, shaped by the interventions of colonial powers and the aspirations of both the Jewish and Arab populations.\nUltimately, the path to a lasting and equitable resolution lies in acknowledging the historical grievances, legitimate aspirations, and rights of all parties involved. Only through an open and honest dialogue, grounded in historical facts and a willingness to compromise, can the cycle of violence and conflict be broken, paving the way for a sustainable and mutually agreed upon solution to this enduring conflict.",

This decision mirrors similar policies already in place in the Netherlands, raising concerns about the potential impact on domestic workers and the broader implications for European education and training systems.\nAccording to reports from Deutsche Welle (DW), the German government plans to offer substantial tax relief to skilled immigrants who take up employment within the country. The proposed scheme would provide a 30% tax reduction in the first year of employment, followed by 20% in the second year, and 10% in the third. This strategy aims to address Germany’s growing skills shortage, despite the nation’s reputation as a highly skilled country known for exporting high-end products.\nHowever, the policy has not been well-received domestically. Politicians and trade unionists have voiced strong opposition, labelling it as blatant discrimination against domestic workers. Critics argue that the move poses a danger to social cohesion and demonstrates utter indifference towards the native workforce. The German Green Party has gone so far as to suggest that the policy could potentially violate the German constitution by allowing one group of workers to earn more than others for performing identical jobs.\nThe situation in Germany reflects a broader trend across the European Union (EU), where member states are grappling with significant skills shortages. Despite the EU’s open borders and freedom of movement for workers across its 450 million-strong population, the bloc continues to face a substantial skills gap. This has led to an increasing reliance on offering visas and tax breaks to workers from outside the EU to keep their economies afloat.\nThe irony of this situation is not lost on observers, particularly in light of the EU’s educational statistics. Over 30% of EU citizens aged 16-64 hold university degrees, with this figure rising to 43% for those aged 25-34. In some countries, such as Luxembourg, Cyprus, and Ireland, the percentage of degree holders in the younger age group exceeds 60%. Despite these impressive figures, the persistent skills shortage raises questions about the relevance and effectiveness of the education being provided.\nThe United Kingdom, despite having left the EU, faces similar challenges. The country is frequently reminded of its skills and productivity gap, a legacy perhaps of its time within the EU. However, instead of addressing the root causes of these shortages, there are concerns that the UK may follow in the footsteps of its European neighbours by importing skilled workers rather than investing in domestic education and training.\nCritics argue that if industries and public bodies are aware of their skill requirements, this information should be continuously communicated to educational and training establishments. The fact that this doesn’t appear to be happening effectively points to a systemic failure in aligning education with the needs of the job market.\nA recent report by the Edge Foundation sheds light on the specific areas where skill shortages are most acute in the UK. These include doctors, nurses, and various digital skills such as AI and machine learning specialists, digital transformation experts, project managers, robotics engineers, and machine repairers. The report attributes these shortages to a combination of factors, including economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, the ongoing repercussions of Brexit, the recent pandemic, the need to reach net-zero emissions, and the consequences of the fourth Industrial Revolution.\nHowever, critics argue that these circumstances are not unique to the UK and that the entire EU is suffering from similar challenges. They suggest that the UK might be better positioned to recover from these events if it had a government willing to take bold action rather than exacerbating the situation through policies such as accelerating the shutdown of North Sea oil and gas production and the last remnants of coal mining.\nThe EU Commission itself acknowledges the widespread nature of these shortages. A recent survey found that nearly two-thirds (63%) of small and medium-sized businesses across the EU struggle to find the talent they need. The Commission has identified 42 occupations facing shortages across member states.\nThis situation raises questions about the role of businesses in addressing these shortages. Critics argue that it shouldn’t have reached this stage before governments felt compelled to intervene. They also point out the irony of a trade bloc like the EU, which often prioritises social issues, failing to ensure that its workforce has the necessary skills to support trade and economic growth.\nIn the UK, the situation is further complicated by the issue of student debt. Many students accumulate substantial loans to obtain degrees that may not provide a return on investment, either for the individual or for the taxpayer who ultimately foots the bill if the loans are not repaid.\nIndividuals could potentially benefit from taking the initiative to acquire these in-demand skills through avenues such as evening classes, given the potential earnings associated with filling these skill gaps.\nFor those in the UK who argue that rejoining the EU would solve the country’s problems, the article points out that the EU faces the same skills gap issues. It suggests that neither the UK nor the EU have found effective solutions to these challenges over the past 40 years of implementing similar policies.\nBy criticising what it describes as a “political woke dogma” that relies on mass immigration as a solution to skills shortages. It argues that the perpetual skills gap serves as a convenient excuse for continuing these immigration policies.\nFinally, this takes aim at the higher education system, suggesting that if substantial taxpayer money is being spent on education that has no direct commercial application (as evidenced by the persistent skills gap), then perhaps critics are justified in their use of terms like “Mickey Mouse degrees” to describe some qualifications.\nIn conclusion, this is part of a Europe-wide challenge in aligning education and immigration policies with the needs of the modern workforce. It suggests that current approaches, both in the EU and the UK, may be perpetuating rather than solving these issues, calling for a fundamental rethink of how skills are developed and deployed in the economy.",

However, there’s a topic that often gets pushed aside, despite its significance: the profound impact of lockdowns on children. As the world grappled with the spread of Covid-19, it became evident that the assumptions guiding shutdown decisions were flawed and disproportionately affected our youngest generation.\nAt the heart of the lockdown dilemma lies a fundamental conceptual error – the assumption that measures aimed at shielding vulnerable individuals from severe Covid could be equally effective in halting the spread of the virus. While it’s true that strict isolation could have prevented transmission, and complete normalcy could have led to rampant infections, the reality is more complex than this binary scenario.\nThe initial enthusiasm for measures like social distancing and school closures was propelled by overly simplistic models, which failed to capture the intricate dynamics of a respiratory virus. Unfortunately, real-world experiences have proven these assumptions wrong. Rather than curbing the spread effectively, these measures led to unintended consequences that hit the most vulnerable group the hardest: children.\nAmong these young victims, the toll was particularly evident due to their unique vulnerabilities and the societal responsibility to protect them. Even if school closures had the potential to curb transmission, the damage caused to children’s education, mental well-being, and overall development far outweighed any potential benefits. Yet, we hesitated to explore this aspect fully and are even more reluctant to confront it now.\nChildren in lower socio-economic strata bore a heavier burden, with the impact felt most acutely in low to middle-income countries (LMICs). Shockingly, only 8 percent of rural Indian children could access online classes, and 37 percent had no access to any form of learning. This “technology poverty” wasn’t exclusive to LMICs, as illustrated by the image of California children sitting outside Taco Bell for internet access.\nA common argument was that children are resilient and could recover quickly from the disruption. However, this argument neglected the multifaceted role of schools. Beyond education, schools provide nourishment, safety, and a nurturing environment. Lockdowns inadvertently exacerbated child abuse, disrupted vital school programs like vaccinations and sexual health education, and even led to a rise in child marriages where regulations were lax.\nLockdowns also inflicted psychological wounds on children across all backgrounds. Isolation, virtual life, and arbitrary rules bred confusion and instability, putting tender minds at risk. Worst of all, children were unjustly burdened with guilt for merely being part of a society in which infectious diseases spread. This guilt-tripping narrative contradicted the shared responsibility that typically comes with living collectively.\nDenying children a normal life became particularly perplexing when the imposed rules failed to achieve their intended outcomes. This prompts ethical questions about imposing such measures on children when their efficacy is questionable. While protecting vulnerable family members by limiting children’s interactions might seem reasonable, it’s an imperfect solution. Alternate ideas, like evacuating vulnerable members during a pandemic, warrant more discussion.\nInexplicably, the Covid Inquiry has not given due attention to understanding the impact of lockdowns on children, even though they’re the ones who’ve paid the highest price. It’s crucial that we acknowledge this discrepancy and ensure that our children never suffer needlessly again. Let’s learn from the lockdown scandal that went unnoticed and place our children’s well-being at the forefront of any future decisions. After all, they deserve a normal childhood, even in the face of crises.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_what-does-lord-frosts-resignation-mean-for-boris-johnsons-future-as-pm/content_929.html": "The departure of Lord Frost from Boris Johnson’s Cabinet has been described as a “watershed moment” for the PM as his backbenchers spoke openly about needing a new direction for his party and government. Lord Frost’s resignation could hardly have come at a worse time for Mr Johnson, who has faced potentially the most damaging week in his premiership.\nMr Johnson’s long-term ally had originally agreed to stay on until January, with The Sunday Times reporting that Mr Johnson had told his top EU negotiator that the government could not cope with a high-profile departure when he first handed his resignation in earlier this month. But in an exchange of letters on Saturday night, Lord Frost said that because the news had been made public, he would now stand down with immediate effect.\nBrexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told Times Radio that “quite honestly it’s a devastating blow for the government and for the Prime Minister”.\nHe added: “He’s (Lord Frost) complained that he’s not happy about the direction of policy of the government and clearly that’s shared by a number of backbenchers, hence the revolt we had this week, and it also it echoes what was heard on the doorsteps of many former Conservative voters in North Shropshire this week as well.”\nHe said: “The answer, for Boris Johnson, is to change or go.\n“We are going to have to change policy and get back to Conservative policies, (for) which we were voted in, with a huge majority on the mandate.\n“And the Prime Minister needs to think very carefully whether he can change, whether he wants to change, and I think quite honestly Conservative MPs will be considering the same matters as well over this Christmas holiday.”\nMr Bridgen said: “I think the resignation of Lord Frost, for many, will be a watershed moment quite honestly.”\nAnd he added: “It feels to me as if the old Boris Johnson that we knew and loved some years ago has been hijacked.”\nCOMMENT\nLord Frost was a true Brexiteer, this was the mandate that won Boris a huge majority, but sadly, Boris does not stand for anything, but himself. He was initially a Remainer who saw the Brexit vote as an opportunity to enter the limelight, not realising that the British public would indeed vote to leave. This left him a real dilemma, as he had to proceed with being elected with the mandate of getting Brexit done, which he did, albeit by taking the path of least resistance, but since then, he has muddled through crisis after crisis, as though he has been drowning and coming up for air whenever he could.\nBy appointing Liz Truss, Boris now faces a new dilemma, if she takes a firm hand with the EU, which is what the British public would like to see, she will get the credit, not Boris, leaving him even further out in the wilderness, but if she fails, this will only weaken his position further. This is the result of Boris shying away from taking a firm and strong position with the EU over the last couple of years. After all, this institution has shown its true colours, to the point where most Remainers are now conspicuous by their absence.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-scourge-of-ritalin/content_604.html": "What Is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects children and teens and can continue into adulthood. ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed mental disorder of children. Children with ADHD may be hyperactive and unable control their impulses. Or they may have trouble paying attention. These behaviours interfere with school and home life.\nIt’s more common in boys than in girls. It’s usually discovered during the early school years, when a child begins to have problems paying attention. Adults with ADHD may have trouble managing time, being organised, setting goals, and holding down a job. They may also have problems with relationships, self-esteem, and addiction.\nSymptoms in Children\nSymptoms are grouped into three categories:\nInattention. A child with ADHD:\n- Is easily distracted\n- Doesn’t follow directions or finish tasks\n- Doesn’t appear to be listening\n- Doesn’t pay attention and makes careless mistakes\n- Forgets about daily activities\n- Has problems organizing daily tasks\n- Doesn’t like to do things that require sitting still\n- Often loses things\n- Tends to daydream\nEffects of Ritalin on the Body\nRitalin is one of the common treatment options used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although this stimulant can improve symptoms of ADHD, because of the way it works, it can also cause some side effects. Unfortunately, Ritalin can also be misused, and that comes with the risk of more serious side effects throughout the body. When you first start taking Ritalin for ADHD, the side effects are usually temporary. See your doctor if any symptoms worsen or last beyond a few days.\nRitalin is one of the common treatment options used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAlthough this stimulant can improve symptoms of ADHD, because of the way it works, it can also cause some side effects. Unfortunately, Ritalin can also be misused, and that comes with the risk of more serious side effects throughout the body. When you first start taking Ritalin for ADHD, the side effects are usually temporary. See your doctor if any symptoms worsen or last beyond a few days.\nThe effects of Ritalin on the body\nRitalin (methylphenidate) is a nervous system stimulant that’s commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and children. It’s a brand-name prescription medication that targets dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain to reduce common ADHD symptoms. Though Ritalin is a stimulant, when used in ADHD treatment, it may help with concentration, fidgeting, attention, and listening skills.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 6.1 million U.S. children ages 2-17 (or 9.4 percent of children) were diagnosed with ADHD as of 2016. Ritalin is just one form of treatment for ADHD. It’s often complemented with behavioral therapy. Ritalin is sometimes used to treat narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.\nAs with all stimulants, this medication is a federally controlled substance. Unfortunately, it can be misused, which comes with the risk of serious side effects. Ritalin should only be used with medical supervision. Your doctor will likely see you every few months to make sure the medication is working as it should.\nEven if you take Ritalin correctly and don’t misuse it, it can carry the risk for side effects.\nCentral nervous system\nRitalin influences both dopamine and norepinephrine activity in your brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that affects pleasure, movement, and attention span. Norepinephrine is a stimulant. Ritalin increases the action of these neurotransmitters by blocking their reabsorption into your brain’s neurons. The levels of these chemicals increase slowly, so your doctor will start you on the lowest possible dose and increase it in small increments, if necessary.\nRitalin may make it easier for you to concentrate, be less fidgety, and gain control of your actions. You may also find it easier to listen and focus at your job or in school. If you’re already prone to anxiety or agitation, or have an existing psychotic disorder, Ritalin may worsen these symptoms.\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeaNM2TpxuI?rel=0&controls=0&showinfo=0]\nSome people taking Ritalin experience blurred vision or other changes to eyesight. Other potential side effects include:\n- headache\n- trouble sleeping\n- irritability\n- moodiness\n- nervousness\n- increased blood pressure\n- racing heart beat (rare)\nThis medication can temporarily slow a child’s growth, especially in the first two years of taking it. That’s why your doctor will keep an eye on your child’s height. Your doctor may suggest a ‘drug holiday’ (often done during the summer), which is when the drug is temporarily stopped. This can encourage growth, and also allows your child’s doctor to see how they do without taking the drug. Ritalin, like other central nervous system stimulants, may be habit-forming. If you take a large dose, the quick rise in dopamine can produce a temporary feeling of euphoria.\nIf you have a history of seizures, this medication may cause more seizures.\nTaking Ritalin in high doses or for a long time can be habit-forming. If you stop taking it abruptly, you may experience withdrawal. Symptoms of withdrawal include sleep problems, fatigue, and depression. It’s better to taper off slowly and under a doctor’s care. When misused, stimulants like Ritalin can cause feelings of paranoia and hostility.\nVery high doses can lead to:\n- shakiness or severe twitching\n- mood changes\n- confusion\n- delusions or hallucinations\n- seizures\nCirculatory system\nRitalin can cause circulation problems. Your fingers and toes may feel cold and painful, and your skin may turn blue or red. Use of Ritalin is linked to peripheral vascular disease, including Raynaud’s disease. If you take Ritalin and experience circulatory problems, tell your doctor. Stimulants can also raise your body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. You may feel jittery and irritable. That’s usually not a problem in the short term, but you should have regular exams to check your heart rate and blood pressure.\nStimulants should be taken with caution if you have pre-existing blood pressure or heart problems. Ritalin may increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. Rare cases of sudden death have occurred in people who have structural heart abnormalities. Misusing stimulants by crushing pills and injecting them can lead to blocked blood vessels. An overdose can lead to dangerously high blood pressure or irregular heartbeat. High doses can also lead to life-threatening complications such as heart failure, seizures, and significantly high body temperature.\nThe Agenda\nThe use of Ritalin has increased dramatically over the last 2 or 3 decades, but what is the reason behind this? An increasing number of Doctors as speaking out and there is information about the effects of this vile drug everywhere, yet the medical profession continues to prescribe it to children, despite the HORRENDOUS side effects.\nFirstly the finger of suspicion points to the Pharmaceuticals, who have a vested interest in profiting from the massive revenue generated by the increasing sales of this drug. The Doctors who prescribe it are also doing so for profit, they are rewarded financially by the Pharmaceuticals for forcing this rubbish on innocent children.\nIt is also worth noting that the number of children diagnosed as being ADHD has also been increasing year on year, has this happened spontaneously and for now reason? No……..I beg to differ!\n“The Nanny-State has turned in to the wicked Step-Mother!”\nEducation has been turned in to ‘MIND-NUMBING IN-INDOCTRINATION’ and all those who do not fit in to the tunnel visioned narrative are soon found to be ‘troubled’ in some way, just because they are unable to be DUMBED-DOWN SHEEP! I would be more inclined to blame society for it’s total failure in understanding these children, for failing to see the narrative of the ‘Nanny-State’ and the climate of cultural Marxism that is intolerant of the individual, the free thinker, or the square peg.",

The west, which despite the ‘white shaming agenda’ is the pinnacle of progress and modern civilisation, is falling at an alarming rate.\nThe cultural lack of respect for our society, or even our continent has not just opened the doors to an influx of those who despise the very values that we stand for, it has opened the floodgates. Political correctness has been used to gag the masses and thanks to strict policing of social media, it has increasingly become offensive to protect our wonderful society for the fear of offending.\nIt is not yet clear if it is too late, but my guess would be that it is, because the population of Europe represents such a small fraction of the world’s total that on further investigation, it becomes clearly apparent that within a generation or two, the Europe that we know will have gone for ever.\nThose on the left, may consider that to be a good thing, within Germany, there have even been politicians celebrating the end of the German Race as a national identity, but do they really understand the full implications of becoming the minority to those who hold our society in contempt?\nI believe that we are approaching civilisations’ darkest hour, it may be within my lifetime that a European country will become the first to fall in to ‘indigenous ethnic minority’ and that day, will be the day that the annihilation of everything we hold dear will become recognised.\nThe political classes in anticipation of a backlash are pushing for further distribution of migrants to the far reaches of Europe, with plans to extend that in to leafy villages so that there is nowhere to hide, nowhere to continue our way of life and nowhere that it will be acceptable to object.\nThis is without doubt, a snowball effect, as the number grow, as our identity is eroded, as the emerging generations show less and less respect for their heritage, the numbers supporting open borders and globalisation will grow, while the persecuted indigenous Europeans, who are a tiny minority in the order of things, are slowly eradicated.",

The nation is in serious need of quality leadership, that is not simply in the hands of the Prime Minister, who has succeeded, despite a few hiccups, to keep the nation on-track.\nHe has successfully navigated through Brexit, which had an opposition funded at the highest level, in order to keep the UK in line with the wishes of the globalists, then he had to deal with Covid, which was fraught with scaremongering, but despite that, he demonstrated that he was not going to exploit it to turn the country in to a police state, like many others.

This is not about division between supporters, we are all fighting for the same principles, but conversely, angry, frustrated and genuinely patriotic people have clearly been insulted.\nThis is on top of the fact that Nigel Farage declared that he was going to be writing over 1,000 Conservative Councillors, to ask them to consider moving over to Reform. Whilst there is no problem with those who have genuinely decided that the Tories are not for them, like Lee Anderson who moved over ages ago with no guarantee that he would be able to hold on to his seat, but as far as I am concerned, pandering to sitting Tories, is yet another indication that this is about a vendetta and not the best interests of Reform UK.\nThere are candidates up and down the country who are sat twiddling their thumbs with no idea where they stand, they are all for the time being in the position of ‘spokespersons’ and in the meantime, some of those who have dared to post anything supporting Tommy Robinson have been suspended. All this at a time when every constituency should have a democratically elected prospective parliamentary candidate to be the voice of opposition for the members and voters. 650 constituencies with leadership and a collective voice are a formidable force, one that is desperately needed.\nThe question now is, where do we go from here?\nIf we allow ourselves to be fractured, the centre right will be divided further and the only beneficiary will be this insidious administration, however on the other hand, we cannot be expected to support a party that has insulted such a large percentage of their supporters.\nAs I have said, the fight, the party and the political brand does not belong to any one or group of individuals, but for this to be work in practice, it is you, the supporters, members and voters who should make the decision, the only way that any leadership can be kept on the straight and narrow, be they in office or not, is if they are accountable to the people, and the leadership of Reform UK are not.\nTherefore, we need to make a decision as soon as possible, are we going to allow our cause to be fractured at the most politically threatening time in our history, or are we going to stand our ground, take the fight to Reform UK, take control of our party, and set our sights on the future collectively.\nReform UK is the umbrella for British patriots, no individual is greater than the party and those who are a threat to all the hard getting here and in that regard, if new faces are required to continue the fight, then that is exactly what we must insist upon.",

This lengthy roll of discord includes Farage versus Alan Sked, Farage versus Robert Kilroy-Silk, Farage versus Godfrey Bloom, Farage versus Suzanne Evans, Farage versus Douglas Carswell, Farage versus Ben Habib, and now, most recently, Farage versus Rupert Lowe. One might charitably suggest that Mr Farage has simply been extraordinarily unfortunate—a political figure somehow destined to encounter a disproportionate number of difficult and uncooperative individuals throughout his career, thus explaining this remarkable pattern of painful clashes and public disagreements.\nAlternatively, we might apply what I have come to term as “Markle’s Law”: if one discovers that one’s entire life trajectory is characterised by repeated interpersonal conflicts, then the common problematic element, when assessed on the balance of probability, is unlikely to be every single individual with whom one interacts, but rather, one’s own self. This principle of introspection seems particularly pertinent in the current situation.\nIn a notable television interview with Dan Wootton this past Monday evening, Lowe, who now sits as the independent MP for Great Yarmouth following his expulsion from Reform UK, described the campaign orchestrated against him as both “unfair and un-Christian”—strong words that hint at the depth of his personal distress regarding these developments.\nIt is important to acknowledge that an investigation may indeed uncover genuine wrongdoing. We must not prejudge the outcome of any formal proceedings. Nevertheless, the precise details and suspicious timing of the allegations against Lowe raise legitimate questions about their credibility and motivation. The British public is expected to accept at face value that the party reported Lowe to the police a full three months after the alleged impropriety occurred; coincidentally, this report was made precisely one day after Lowe publicly voiced criticism of Farage. Such remarkable timing inevitably invites scepticism regarding the party’s true motivations.\nWhilst the allegations concerning office misconduct were not specifically directed at Lowe himself, Reform UK’s initial public statement appeared deliberately crafted to create the impression that he had personally engaged in mistreatment of staff members. In a powerful rebuke to these insinuations, Lowe’s entire parliamentary team have subsequently signed a heartfelt letter categorically denying the allegations and describing their employer as a fundamentally decent man who has treated them with respect and consideration. Most curiously, they also insist—rather perplexingly—that they have never once been contacted as part of any parliamentary investigation into workplace conduct within Lowe’s office, despite such an investigation supposedly being the basis for the disciplinary action against him.\nIn this unfortunate episode, Reform UK appears to be exhibiting precisely the sort of behaviour it would normally condemn vociferously when practised by other political entities: namely, cancellation without proper due process, even going so far as to involve the police over what are alleged to be merely hurtful or offensive words. The irony of this position, given the party’s frequent criticism of ‘cancel culture’, cannot be overlooked.\nDuring a subsequent television appearance, Richard Tice, who serves as Reform UK’s deputy leader, strongly implied that Lowe might not be welcomed back into the party fold, even in the hypothetical scenario where his complete innocence were conclusively established. This remarkable stance suggests that the disciplinary measures taken against Lowe may be motivated by factors beyond the specific allegations currently being investigated.\nAdding further confusion to the situation, Mr Farage insisted during a televised interview that on “29 February” Lowe was “informed” about a “parliamentary investigation” into allegations raised against him. This claim is doubly problematic: not only does Lowe categorically deny having received any such notification, but there was no 29th February in the current year—2025 is not a leap year. Consequently, as attempted political assassinations go, this one appears remarkably amateurish and poorly executed—displaying the finesse of Fanny Cradock rather than the calculated precision of Francis Urquhart.\nIn perhaps the most disturbing development, Lowe has alleged that individuals within Reform UK have been deliberately briefing journalists with the false claim that he suffers from early-onset dementia—a cruel assertion that Farage himself may have obliquely referenced in a recent Telegraph article, wherein he described Lowe as having become a “different person” from the individual he had known during their time together in the Brexit Party. As someone who dedicates substantial periods to caring for a parent suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, I found this particular tactic profoundly offensive and morally reprehensible. Dementia is an immensely serious and utterly devastating condition, not something to be callously deployed as a convenient weapon in political squabbles or factional score-settling exercises.\nSince his election to the House of Commons, Lowe has steadily cultivated a reputation as a diligent and committed Member of Parliament, taking his responsibilities towards his constituents with appropriate seriousness. The political reporter Christian Calgie has astutely observed that “by removing the whip from Lowe, Reform UK’s total parliamentary activity since the general election has fallen by 46 per cent”—a statistic that speaks volumes about Lowe’s industry and engagement with parliamentary business relative to his Reform UK colleagues. This highlights an essential truth: every successful political party requires not only charismatic figureheads but also its diligent thinkers, its policy specialists, and its meticulous attention-to-detail parliamentarians.\nA consistently expressed concern from multiple sources within Reform UK is that under the leadership of Farage and party chairman Zia Yusuf, the organisation operates in an excessively centralised, brittle and overtly presidential style. This approach fundamentally misunderstands the British political system. The United Kingdom’s political framework is not, and indeed has never been, presidential in nature. If Reform UK genuinely harbours ambitions to form a government, as its senior figures regularly insist, they will eventually need at minimum one hundred capable ministers to effectively govern the country—and this without currently having a single representative in the House of Lords. In essence, the party simply cannot function effectively as a private fiefdom or merely as a platform for articulating grievances without proposing substantive solutions.\nLowe’s abrupt removal from the party potentially imperils Reform UK’s aspirations for professionalisation and credibility in multiple significant ways. What serious-minded individual would willingly join Reform UK and agree to stand as a parliamentary candidate when their professional reputation and personal life could be so publicly and destructively undermined at the first sign of disagreement with the party leadership? The risk-reward calculation becomes prohibitively unfavourable for precisely the calibre of candidates the party most desperately needs to attract.\nFurthermore, it becomes exceedingly difficult to persuade those voters who are justifiably disenchanted with the conduct of mainstream political parties that Reform UK represents a genuinely different and more principled alternative worthy of their electoral support when the party immediately resorts to precisely the same kind of vicious internal feuding—the proverbial rats-in-a-sack scrapping—that has long characterised the worst aspects of both Conservative and Labour party management, despite having secured only a modest handful of parliamentary representatives.\nA political party that can accommodate only a single dominant personality will inevitably struggle to assemble anything resembling a functional shadow cabinet, let alone an actual governing administration capable of running the country effectively.\nThe Labour Party, for all its well-documented shortcomings and policy failures, generally maintains a culture of internal loyalty, with members routinely defending their colleagues even in situations where those colleagues are manifestly in the wrong. This approach, while sometimes frustrating to outside observers, creates a sense of collective endeavour and shared purpose essential for effective governance.\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner may privately harbour profound personal dislike for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but she nevertheless manages to maintain a professional working relationship with him in the national interest. Similarly, within the Conservative Party, while Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick may never develop the warmest of personal friendships, Badenoch has wisely chosen to give her leadership rival a prominent role in her shadow cabinet, effectively deploying him as a formidable attack-dog against the current Labour government. On balance, astute political leaders recognise that it is invariably preferable to have talented and effective individuals working alongside you rather than criticising your leadership from the political wilderness.\nAt this critical juncture in British political life, there exists a genuine and pressing need for precisely the sort of rigorous parliamentary accountability and scrutiny that Lowe consistently provided in the House of Commons. The government’s sustained assault on traditional British farming proceeds relentlessly. Labour ministers continue to evade proper scrutiny regarding the controversial Chagos Islands agreement. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson’s deeply problematic schools reform bill will shortly return to the Commons to continue what many observers perceive as its systematic dismantling of educational standards and rigour. Meanwhile, illegal migrant Channel crossings and the associated use of hotel accommodation for asylum seekers are both increasing under this Labour administration—a stark reminder of precisely the issues upon which Reform UK should be focusing its political energies and public messaging.\nYet instead of addressing these substantive policy concerns, Reform UK has chosen this precise moment to launch what appears to be a remarkably botched internal coup against one of its most effective parliamentarians. One can only imagine that within the corridors of Number 10 Downing Street, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his influential chief of staff Morgan McSweeney must be positively rubbing their hands with undisguised glee at this unexpected political gift from their opponents.\nThe tragedy in this situation extends beyond the personal circumstances of Rupert Lowe. Britain genuinely needs a credible alternative to the established political parties—an alternative that could provide authentic representation for those voters who feel abandoned by both Labour and the Conservatives. The current Reform UK leadership, through its mishandling of this internal dispute, appears to be squandering what might have been a historic opportunity to establish such an alternative and thereby reshape the British political landscape for generations to come.\nSummary\n• Rupert Lowe joins a long list of Nigel Farage’s political fallings-out, suggesting a pattern of conflict\n• Lowe, now an independent MP for Great Yarmouth, was expelled from Reform UK under controversial circumstances\n• The timing of allegations against Lowe appears suspicious – reported to police three months after alleged incidents but just one day after he criticized Farage\n• Lowe’s entire parliamentary team signed a letter defending him and denying any misconduct\n• Reform UK seems to be engaging in the same “cancel culture” behavior it typically condemns\n• Farage made factual errors in his accusations, including referring to “29 February” in a non-leap year\n• There are allegations that Reform insiders falsely briefed journalists that Lowe has early-onset dementia\n• Since entering Parliament, Lowe had established a reputation as a hardworking MP – his removal has reportedly reduced Reform UK’s parliamentary activity by 46%\n• Reform UK operates in a “brittle, presidential style” under Farage and chairman Zia Yusuf\n• This leadership approach is incompatible with the UK’s parliamentary system, which requires a team of capable ministers\n• The internal conflict undermines Reform’s credibility and discourages serious candidates from joining\n• Other parties manage internal conflicts more professionally – Labour maintains loyalty, while Conservatives give rivals important roles\n• Reform UK is missing opportunities to hold the government accountable on key issues like farming, education reforms, and migration\n• The party’s internal squabbling benefits Labour and PM Keir Starmer\n• Britain needs a viable alternative to established parties, but Farage appears to be squandering this opportunity\nComment\nThere is no doubt that Reform UK in its current form will not survive this, no self-respecting politician, or confident speaker would go near this party for fear of being subjected to the same abuse as Rupert Lowe.\nThis all began a long time ago, let’s not forget that from the 1st January 2020 until the 3rd of June 2024, Nigel Farage made no contribution to Reform UK, it was Richard Tice, Ben Habib, Ann Widecombe and all the hard working candidates and supporters who took the party from less than 1% to polling over 20% before the election.\nNigel Farage, not wanting to miss an opportunity to take centre-stage, decided to join in as the boss, by standing for the easiest seat to win, but in the actual election, Reform only polled 14.3% and there are many who would argue that Nigel Farage alienated more people than he attracted, but that of course is just conjecture.\nFast forward to the recent events and it seems that Farage has shown his true colours, firstly, the party HAS NOT democratised, on the contrary, despite lying to Reform UK supporters about the process, his claim that he no longer owns shares in the party were to say the least misleading, because the shares are now owned by Reform 2025, which is owned entirely by Nigel Farage and Zia Yusuf, cutting out Richard Tice.\nAs the facts become clear, it seems that the allegations against Rupert Lowe are malicious lies and the ONLY way forward would be for Nigel, Richard, Lee and Zia to resign, to allow Rupert to take control, invite Ben Habib and all the hard working candidates back into the party and stick to core Reform UK policy at any cost.\nWill this happen, or will Reform sink? I have a feeling that Farage would prefer to preside over the ashes of Reform UK, rather than contribute to its success, but only time will tell if I am right.",

They plan to DESTROY member states and transfer ALL POWER to Brussels. This will be the last nail in the Coffin for the EU.\nA strong Europe in a world of uncertainties\nThe decision of the British people marks a watershed moment in the history of Europe. The European Union is losing not only a member state, but a host of history, tradition and experience, with which we shared our journey throughout the past decades. France and Germany therefore take note of this decision with regret. This creates a new situation and will entail consequences for both the United Kingdom and for the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon sets out the procedures for the orderly departure of a Member State (article 50). Once the British Government has activated these procedures, we will stand ready to assist the institutions in the negotiations clarifying the future relationship between the EU and the UK.\nThe British case is unique. But we must also acknowledge that support and passion for our common project has faded over the last decade in parts of our societies. Neither a simple call for more Europe nor a phase of mere reflection can be an adequate answer. To prevent the silent creeping erosion of our European project we have to be more focused on essentials and on meeting the concrete expectations of our citizens. We are convinced that it is not the existence of the Union that they object to but the way it functions. Our task is twofold: we have to strictly focus our joints efforts on leaving others to national or regional decision making and variation. And we must deliver better on those issues we have chosen to focus on.\nFrance and Germany remain most firmly of the belief that the European Union provides a unique and indispensable framework for the pursuit of freedom, prosperity and security in Europe, for shaping peaceful and mutually beneficial relationships amongst its people and for contributing to peace and stability in the world. Our two countries share a common destiny and a common set of values that provide the foundation for ever closer union between our peoples. We will therefore move further towards political union in Europe and invite the other Europeans to join us in this endeavour. France and Germany recognize their responsibility to reinforce solidarity and cohesion within the European Union. To that end, we need to recognize that member states differ in their levels of ambition member state when it comes to the project of European integration. While not stepping back from what we have achieved, we have to find better ways of dealing with different levels of ambition so as to ensure that Europe delivers better on the expectations of all European citizens.\nWe believe the EU can and needs to develop common answers to today’s challenges abroad and at home. In a context of rising global challenges and opportunities, we see the European Union as more necessary than ever and as the only framework capable of providing appropriate collective answers to the changing international environment. France and Germany will therefore promote a more coherent and a more assertive Europe on the world stage. To deliver better, Europe must focus on today’s main challenges — ensure the security of our citizens confronted with growing external and internal threats; establish a stable cooperative framework for dealing with migration and refugee flows; boost the European economy by promoting convergence and sustainable and job-creating growth and advancing towards the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union.\nWe are seeing the European Union being severely put to the test. It is challenged by a series of crises in its southern and eastern environment. It is recovering slowly on the path of economic growth. Looking back at the history of the European edifice, we strongly believe in the strength of the EU and its ability to overcome these situations. But something is new in these critical times, namely the perception that these crises jeopardise the very fabric of our societies, our values, our way of life. We see terrorists attempting to spread fear and division in our societies. We have to face increasingly interwoven internal and external challenges. We see the need to preserve the combination of growth, competitiveness and social cohesion which lies at the heart of our European model while preserving our common values both internally and vis-a-vis the outside world.\nWe know there are no quick solutions to these very demanding problems. But we are determined to address them, working to deal with current challenges while remaining focused on important long-term issues. In this spirit, we have agreed on the following proposals\nA European Security Compact\nThe EU has to face a deteriorating security environment and an unprecedented level of threat. External crises have become more numerous, closer to Europe — both east and south of its borders — and more likely to have immediate consequences for European territory and the security of EU citizens. Power politics are back on the world stage and conflict is being imported into our continent. The terrorist threat is growing, feeding on complex networks in and outside Europe and stemming from crisis zones and unstable, war-torn regions all over the world. Europe’s role as a credible force for peace is more important than ever.\nThe security of EU member states is deeply interconnected, as these threats now affect the continent as a whole: any threat to one member state is also a threat to others. We therefore regard our security as one and indivisible. We consider the European Union and the European security order to be part of our core interests and will safeguard them in any circumstances.\nIn this context, France and Germany recommit to a shared vision of Europe as a security union, based on solidarity and mutual assistance between member states in support of common security and defence policy. Providing security for Europe as well as contributing to peace and stability globally is at the heart of the European project.\nWe see the EU as a key power in its neighborhood but also as an actor for peace and stability with global reach. An actor able to make a decisive contribution to tackling global challenges and to support a rules-based international order underpinned by strategic stability, based on a peaceful balance of interests. We have considerable achievements that deserve recognition and can provide inspiration. The historic agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme was only possible because of the EU’s determined and persistent commitment. European engagement in the Minsk process has helped to contain a military confrontation in eastern Ukraine that could have easily spiralled out of control. Our diplomatic efforts have paved the way for a political settlement to the conflict which we will continue to pursue. In Libya, we support the emerging government of national accord endeavouring to address the risks posed by state fragility and instability in the Southern Mediterranean. Beyond the crises, we are convinced that Africa needs also a continuous commitment, being a continent of great challenges and opportunities.\nOne of the mean features of today’s security environment is the interdependence between internal and external security, since the most dangerous and destabilising risks emanate from the interaction between external threats and internal weaknesses. To respond to this challenge, Germany and France propose a European Security Compact which encompasses all aspects of security and defence dealt with at the European level and thus delivers on the EU’s promise to strengthen security for its citizens.\nA first step is to share a common analysis of our strategic environment and common understanding of our interests. France and Germany propose that the EU conduct regular reviews of its strategic environment, to be submitted and discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council and at the European Council. These reviews will be supported by an independent situation assessment capability, based on the EU intelligence and situation centre and expertise from outside European institutions, with production of strategic and intelligence analysis approved at European level.\n- On the basis of this common understanding, the European Union should establish agreed strategic priorities for its foreign and security policy, in accordance with European interests.\n- The European Union Global Strategy is a first step in that direction. But we need to push further: on a more contested and competitive international scene, France and Germany will promote the EU as an independent and global actor able to leverage its unique array of expertise and tools, civilian and military, in order to defend and promote the interests of its citizens. France and Germany will promote integrated EU foreign and security policy bringing together all EU policy instruments.\n- The EU will need to take action more often in order to manage crises that directly affect its own security. We therefore need stronger and more flexible crisis prevention and crisis management capabilities. The EU should be able to plan and conduct civil and military operations more effectively, with the support of a permanent civil-military chain of command. The EU should be able to rely on employable high-readiness forces and provide common financing for its operations. Within the framework of the EU, member states should consider establishing standing maritime forces or acquiring EU-owned capabilities in other key areas.\n- In order to live up to the growing security challenges, Europeans need to step up their defence efforts. European member states should reaffirm and abide by the commitments made collectively on defence budgets and the portion of spending dedicated to the procurement of equipment and to research and technology (R&T). Within the EU, France and Germany propose the establishment of a European semester on defence capabilities. Through this process, the EU will support efforts by member states by ensuring the coherence of defence and capability-building processes and encourage member states to discuss the priorities of their respective military spending plans. The establishment of a European defence research programme will support an innovative European industry.\n- The European Union must invest more in preventing conflict, in promoting human security and in stabilising its neighbourhood and regions affected by crisis all over the world. The EU should help its partners and neighbors develop their capacity and governance structures, to strengthen their crisis resilience and their ability to prevent and control emerging crises as well as terrorist threats. France and Germany will conduct join initiatives in stabilisation, development and reconstruction in Syria and Iraq when the situation allows. Together, France and Germany will strengthen their civilian crisis management tools and reaffirm their commitment to support and sustain political processes of conflict resolution.\n- In order to ensure our internal security, the immediate challenges are primarily operational. The objectives are to implement and monitor EU decisions and make the best use of existing frameworks: PNR; Europol and its counterterrorism centre; the fight against terrorist financing; and EU action plans against trafficking of weapons and explosives. A special emphasis should be put on strengthening transport safety. We also want to increase our dialogue and cooperation with third countries in North Africa, the Sahel strip, the Lake Chad Basin, West Africa, the horn of Africa and the Middle East, as well as regional and sub-regional organizations (Africa Union, G5).\n- In order to address the root causes of terrorism, France and Germany will develop a European platform to share experience and best practice in preventing and counteracting radicalisation.\n- In the medium term, we should work towards a more integrated approach for EU internal security, based on the following measures: creation of a European platform for intelligence cooperation, fully respecting national prerogatives and using the current frameworks (e.g. CTG); improvement of data exchange; European contingency planning for major crisis scenarios affecting several member states; creation of a European response capability; establishment of a European civil protection corps.\n- In the longer term, it would make sense to enlarge the scope of the European public prosecutor’s office in future (currently limited to prosecuting offenses concerning the EU’s financial interests) to include fighting terrorism and organised crime. This would require harmonisation of criminal law among the member states.\nIn order to drive this effort, France and Germany propose that the European Council should meet once a year as a European Security Council, in order to address internal and external security and defence issues facing the EU. This European Security Council should be prepared by a meeting of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Interior Ministers.\nCommon European asylum and migration policy\nLarge-scale migration towards Europe will be the key challenge for Europe’s future.\nThere shall be no unilateral answers to the migration challenge, which is a truly European challenge of the 21th century. Our citizens expect that we firmly regain control on our external borders while preserving our European values. We have to act jointly to live up to this expectation. Germany and France are convinced that it is high time to work towards establishing truly integrated European asylum, refugee and migration policy. Given the urgency of the matter, we should not rule out the possibility of a group of member states that share a sense of common responsibility making progress on common policies.\n- Securing our external border is no longer exclusively a national task but also a common responsibility. We are determined that the EU should establish the world’s first multinational border and coast guard. In the short term, FRONTEX will be manned by mean of secondments from member states. France and Germany should propose a join contribution to that end. Over the medium term FRONTEX should be scaled up not only in terms of having its own permanent staff but also with adequate technical equipment to fulfill this task.\n- We also propose the creation of a European ESTA for visa-exempt third country nationals as a useful instrument to reinforce our borders and security.\n- It is our common duty to protect those fleeing from war or political persecution. In our efforts we strive to allow refugees to find shelter as close to their homeland as possible.\n- Asylum seekers reaching Europe have a right to be treated according to the Geneva Convention no matter where they reach our shores. To this end we must further harmonise and simplify our standards and procedures in specific areas. We shall stand ready to grant EU support for the establishment of efficient asylum systems where needed. Over the medium term the European Asylum Office should be transformed into a European Asylum Agency to support this process of standardisation and host join databases to prevent the misuse of differences in standards as well as multiple registrations and discourage secondary movements. This European Asylum Agency would help reinforce convergence in the way applications for international protection are assessed, with due regard to the Dublin basic principles such as the responsibility of the member state of first entry to deal with an asylum application.\n- Solidarity remains a cornerstone of our European project. Citizens expect that the benefits and burdens of EU membership be evenly shared among member states. A situation in which the burden of migration is unevenly carried by a limited number of member states is unsustainable. As a first step, the Dublin system has to be improved to deal with exceptional circumstances by means of a permanent and binding mechanism which forsees burden sharing among all member states. If necessary, Germany and France stand ready to proceed on this matter with a group of like-minded partners.\n- The EU must find a common answer to the rising number of migrants seeking to enter the EU for economic reasons. The asylum system is a misleading entry point for them to use. Europe should stay open to what migration and mobility can contribute to our societies in the fields of the economy, culture and diversity. We need to work towards a European Immigration Act that clearly states what the legal options are when it comes to working in Europe, taking into account the different states of national labour markets in the EU. At the same time, we have to improve EU tools and support in the field of return policy, underpinned by EU funds to finance the deportation of those who entered the EU illegally.\n- In our relations with the key countries of origin and transit, we will work to reduce push factors for irregular migration, for example by generating economic and social opportunities, particularly for young people. We expect constructive cooperation in crucial fields such as return and readmission, border management and control and the fight against migrant smuggling. Germany and France have already held high-level migration dialogues with a number of African states on behalf of the EU and will extend this dialogue to other countries. Root causes of migration, such as poverty, lack of security and political instability should also be addressed by the EU.\nFinally, hosting and, in some cases, integrating refugees and migrants poses a challenge to all European societies that must be dealt with in a spirit of responsibility and solidarity. Germany and France to not share the same historical experience of immigration and integration but are committed to learning from each other. Through dialogue, exchange and cooperation, we intend to foster a more objective debate about the challenges and opportunities of immigration and integration for our societies. We hope thus to use the lessons we have learned to benefit other European states that are confronted with similar challenges.\nFostering growth and completing the Economic and Monetary Union\nTo this day, our common currency constitutions the most visible and ambitious undertaking of European unification. The euro has helped protect its member states from international speculation and contributed to building a common economic area. The euro reflects our commitment to the irreversibility of European integration.\nHowever, we must admit that the crisis and its aftermath have shown up deficiencies that make citizens question whether the common currency delivers on its promises and even casts doubt on the sustainability of the project itself. We therefore intend to proceed on three fronts simultaneously: strengthening economic convergence, enhancing social justice and democratic accountability and improving shock resistance to safeguard the irreversibility of the euro. France and Germany have always seen it as their major responsibility to build a robust Eurozone able to assert its model in a more and more competitive world.\nWe believe we urgently need to revive this spirit to carry the debate forward. And it is the responsibility of our two countries to bilaterally proceed beyond that. We have to acknowledge that the requirements of membership and the fiscal implications stemming from the common currency have been higher than one could have expected when the euro was founded. We must therefore respect the wish of others to decide on their own when to join the euro.\n- To overcome the crisis, the euro area has to enter into a renewed phase of economic convergence. To this end, France and Germany will shoulder the main responsibility of organising a process of economic convergence and political governance which balances obligations and solidarity to accompany the process. Surplus and deficit countries will have to move, as a one-sided alignment is politically unfeasible.\n- Growth potential has been severely hampered by the crisis. Europe urgently needs to unlock the untapped potential inherent in the completion of the single market in specific sectors of strategic interest. France and Germany remain committed to bilateral initiatives to rapidly harmonise regulation and oversight as well as corporate tax schemes. To unlock growth and to increase the productivity of the European economy, a renewed effort for more investment, both private and public, is necessary. France and Germany reiterate their commitment to structural reforms to attract international investment and to further enhance the competitiveness of their economies.\n- In that respect, specific initiatives should be taken in order to foster growth and convergence between member states in strategic sectors such as energy, the digital sector, research and innovation or professional training. In the short term, common targets could be set, linked to regulatory objectives and investment means based on the amplification of the European Fund for Strategic Investment. Over the medium term, those strategic sectors should evolve towards a common regulatory framework and even a shared supervisory authority, and benefit from a structured European investment capability to foster convergence through cross-border investment. Bilateral initiatives by Germany and France should be undertaken within that framework.\n- The current architecture of the euro is not sufficiently resilient to external shocks or internal imbalances. Leaving the EMU incomplete jeopardises the survival of our common currency in the long term. Completing the EMU will involve the continuous intensification of political governance as well as fiscal burden sharing. In light of existing imbalances a deepening of the EMU will not come as a big bang but as the result of a pragmatic and gradual evolution taking into account the necessary results in terms of growth and employment. These results are indispensable to reinforce confidence in the European Union among member states and citizens and create the appropriate political conditions for new steps of integration towards completing the EMU.\n- We should acknowledge that EMU member states share different traditions of economic policy making, which have to be balanced out for the euro to function properly. A future architecture of the euro will neither be solely rules based nor prone to mere political decision making nor will it be steered exclusively by market forces. Every step in deepening the EMU will encompass all of these aspects.\n- Since economic policy-making in the EMU is increasing a domain of shared decisions, citizens rightly expect to regain control via supranational institutions accountable to them. In the short term a full time president of the Eurogroup should be accountable to a Eurozone subcommmittee in the European Parliament. In the longer term, the Eurogroup and its president should be accountable to a parliamentary body comprising members of the European Parliament with the participation of members of national parliaments. This chamber should have full authority on any matters regarding fiscal and macroeconomic oversight.\n- In this context we should develop the European STability Mechanism (ESM) into a fully-fledged European Monetary Fund subject to parliamentary control.\n- A fiscal capacity — a common feature of any successful monetary union around the globe — remains a missing keystone in the EMU architecture. In the long run it should provide macroeconomic stabilisation at the eurozone level while avoiding permanent unidirectional transfers. Whereas these capabilities should be built up over time and in line with progress on common decision making regarding fiscal and economic policy, it should start by 2018 at th latest to support investment in the member states most severely hit by the crisis. Germany and France should form a group prepared to lead on this matter.\n- Public support for the euro is undermined by a lack of progress on its social dimension and fair taxation among its member states. Hence, as a general principle, any step to further deepen the EMU should be accompanied by progress in the field of common taxation, in particular with regard to transnational corporations, as well as the development of a social union underpinned by common social minimum standards.",

Neither do crises.\nJust who does Gordon Brown think he is kidding?\nThis is the man who voted time and time again, against building more Nuclear power stations, starting the slippery slope of British energy dependence upon Russian Gas, along with wind and solar power that is about as reliable as the weather! (pardon pun)\nSuccessive governments have neglected to address our energy with adequate foresight, resulting in our entire nation being held to ransom, by Russia, the middle east and the weather! Solar power is an excellent supplement to our energy supply, were it to be utilised correctly, for example, developers could be encouraged with incentives to fit solar roofs to all new properties. If every property, residential or commercial that has been built over the last decade had a solar roof, who much supplementary energy would that supply?\nWind power is also good, provided that expectations are realistic, when the wind does not blow, and for many months it has not, they are about as useful as a Chocolate Tea Pot, yet the ‘virtue-signalling’ political classes were determined to make us dependant on that which is least dependable!\n“When Trump warned about the danger of becoming dependent on Russian Gas, the German delegation were laughing, I bet they are not laughing now!”\nWe have a wonderful and clean source of energy, which would never be of any risk in a safety conscious nation like ours. Many people had concerns about Nuclear energy, but there is nothing that even comes close. The ideal would be Nuclear Fusion, which is just about 100% safe, but that has been thirty years away for the last thirty years, so who knows when that will become a realistic option. In the meantime, we need to stick with Nuclear Fission and Rolls Royce have a wonder modular reactor that can power an entire city. They are not only discreet, camouflaged in beautiful buildings, they are safe and can be commissioned much faster than large, ugly traditional facilities.\nWe need to learn from the never ending crisis that we are in, that is for sure. However, to have Gordon Brown, taking this opportunity to cast aspersions on the current administration (who are just as much to blame, perhaps Boris should have put his foot down with Carrie and her delusional passion for net-zero) is an insult.\nIt would have been far more commendable if Gordon Brown had the maturity to stand up and admit that his position on energy was WRONG and encourage support for Nuclear power that could offer the UK so many benefits, including the production of Hydrogen.\nJust as motorists are turning to EVs in droves, there is a distinct possibility that in the not too distant future, these motorists will find themselves victims of the near-sighted, virtue-signalling, irresponsible Green agenda!",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_women-and-the-sexual-revolution/content_34.html": "Women and the sexual revolution\nFeminist author LOUISE PERRY recently wrote an article in The Mail, titled “Why the sexual revolution has been a disaster for women today” which makes a very real and relative argument, about the real loss to women, hidden behind a cloud of ’empowerment’\nHere is the full article:\nWhen Emma Watson, the film star and women’s rights campaigner, was criticised for showing her breasts on the cover of Vanity Fair, she hit back by asserting ‘feminism is about giving women choice. It’s about freedom’. For liberal feminists like her that might be true.\nBut for many other women — perhaps a sizeable majority — that freedom has spectacularly backfired. It has turned out to be a lie and a con.\nFor younger women in particular, today’s sexual culture is destructive, divorcing love and commitment from sex and favouring one-night stands, casual ‘hook-ups’ and ‘friends with benefits’ arrangements. Worse still, it pressures them into promiscuity, bombards them with violent pornography and tells them to enjoy being humiliated and assaulted in bed. Rather than selfies, many young women on social media now post ‘belfies’ (photos of their bottoms). Instagram and TikTok are filled with the youthful breasts and buttocks of women desperate for some positive male attention.\nSociety now has a sexual script that is increasingly aggressive and loveless, typified by men sending women pictures of their penises, so-called ‘d*ck pics’.\nI don’t know what they think the recipients are supposed to do with them. I know of no woman who would be turned on by an image in which the rest of the person has been cropped away, leaving only a slab of flesh ready to be laid out on the anatomist’s table. Typical female sexuality isn’t orientated towards these kinds of images. But the internet abounds with them. Violence is available, not only on mainstream porn sites but also on social media platforms marketed as suitable for children. Dating apps such as Tinder turn people into products in a sexual marketplace that encourages users to browse the available merchandise and select their preferred options from the comfort of their homes, with very little effort and no intimacy whatsoever.\nOne male user described the voracious appetite that the apps encourage: ‘You’re always prowling. ‘In a bar you might have two or three girls to choose from but online you can swipe a couple of hundred a day and set up two or three Tinder dates a week and, chances are, sleeping with all of them.\n‘You could rack up 100 girls you’ve slept with in a year.’\nAnother user compares Tinder to an online food delivery service —‘but you’re ordering a person’. He saw no harm in scrolling through would-be sexual partners in the same way as we scroll through any other kinds of consumables. In reality, once you permit the idea that people can be products, everything is corroded. When Wonderbra released its famous ‘Hello Boys’ ad campaign, featuring Eva Herzigova admiring her own boosted cleavage, the posters were so distracting that they reportedly caused car crashes. That was in 1994.\nIn contrast, try walking down any British High Street today and keep a tally of how many lingerie-clad boobs and bums you see in shop windows, on the sides of buses and on the covers of newspapers and magazines. The flaunting of sexuality has been so normalised we hardly notice any more.\nWhat all this shows is that sexual liberation — the result primarily of the contraceptive pill which separated sexual activity from procreation — was flawed, largely benefiting men rather than women. It was so from the outset. Take two of the sexual revolution’s earliest icons — Hugh Hefner and Marilyn Monroe. They never met, but they were born in the same year and laid to rest in the same place, side by side.\nMarilyn Monroe was the first naked centrefold in the first edition of Hefner’s Playboy magazine. She had been paid just $50 for a two-hour shoot with a freelance photographer, curling up on a red velvet bedspread\nIn 1992, Hefner bought the crypt next to Monroe’s in a Los Angeles cemetery, commenting that ‘spending eternity next to Marilyn is too sweet to pass up’. At the age of 91, Hefner got his wish. The long-dead Monroe had no say in the matter. But then she had never been given much say in what men did to her over the course of her short life. She was the first naked centrefold in the first edition of Hefner’s Playboy magazine.\n‘Entertainment for men’ was the promise offered on the cover and it was a commercial success from that very first issue. Monroe had been paid just $50 for a two-hour shoot with a freelance photographer, curling up on a red velvet bedspread. She was humiliated by the session, which she resorted to only out of desperate need for money. Hefner didn’t pay her to use her images and didn’t seek her consent before publishing them. Monroe told a friend that she had ‘never even received a thank you from all those who made millions from a nude Marilyn photograph. I even had to buy a copy of the magazine to see myself in it’.\nIn her provocative thesis, Ms Perry looks back at a 16-year-old Britney Spears who ‘gyrated in a school uniform and begged viewers to hit me baby one more time’\nThe courses of these two lives show us in perfect vignette the nature of the sexual revolution’s impact on men and women. Monroe and Hefner both began in obscurity and ended their lives rich and famous. But, while Hefner lived a long, grubby life in his mansion with his ‘Playmates’, Monroe’s life was cut short by misery and substance abuse. As radical feminist Andrea Dworkin wrote: ‘She grinned, she posed, she pretended, she had affairs with famous and powerful men.\n‘She had so many illegal abortions wrongly performed that her reproductive organs were severely injured.\n‘She died alone, possibly acting on her own behalf for the first time. Her lovers in both flesh and fantasy had f***ed her to death.’\nMore than half a century after her death, not much has changed. At the age of 16, pop star Britney Spears gyrated in a school uniform and begged viewers to ‘hit me baby one more time’. She has since suffered a protracted and very public nervous breakdown. Hefner, on the other hand, experienced ‘sexual liberation’ very differently from Monroe, as men typically do. He lived the fantasy of a particularly immature adolescent boy, hosting parties for his celebrity friends and then retiring upstairs with his harem of identical 20-something blondes.\nAccording to one of his Playmates, in old age, life in the Playboy mansion consisted of ‘Hef just lying there with his Viagra erection. Each girl gets on top of him for two minutes while the girls in the background try to keep him excited by yelling obscenities’.\nHe took an obsessive and coercive attitude towards the girls, dictating how they wore their hair and make-up, keeping a detailed log of all his sexual encounters and becoming angry if refused sex. He never experienced any guilt for the harm he perpetrated. Asked, aged 83, if he regretted any of the dark consequences of the Playboy revolution he set in motion, he was confident in his innocence: ‘It’s a small price to pay for personal freedom.’\nBy which he meant, of course, personal freedom for men like him. After his death in 2017, a British journalist argued that Hefner had indeed ‘helped push feminism forwards’ by taking a progressive stance to the contraceptive pill and abortion rights and promoting them in his magazines. But his commitment to decoupling reproduction from sex had nothing to do with a commitment to women’s well-being. When fear of pregnancy was one of the last remaining reasons for women saying ‘no’, he had every reason to wish for a change that would widen the pool of women available to him.\nThe sexual revolution that began in the 1960s certainly freed women from the burdens of chastity and motherhood, giving them control over their reproductive lives. But it also brought the triumph of the playboy, pretending they were liberating women when in truth it was their own libidos and depravities they were liberating. There have been plenty of periods in history in which the norms around sex have been loosened for a while.\nBut the sexual revolution of the 1960s stuck and its ideology is now a murky sea we all swim in. I used to believe the liberal narrative that this free-and-easy attitude to sex was unalloyed progress. As a younger woman, I conformed to liberal feminist ideas that saw nothing wrong in porn, bondage, sadomasochism and hook-up culture. Women were just expressing the same casual and adventurous approach to sex as men did.\nI let go of these beliefs after working at a rape crisis centre, where I witnessed the reality of male violence up close. It made me realise that the sexual revolution has not freed all of us, but it has freed some of us, selectively and at a price. Believe me, I’m not anti-liberal and I don’t reject the desire for freedom. I recognise that with the right tools, freedom from the constraints imposed on women by our societies and our bodies now becomes increasingly possible.\nDon’t want to have children in your 20s or 30s? Freeze your eggs. Called away on a work trip post-partum? FedEx your breast milk to your newborn. Want to continue working full-time without interruption? Employ a nanny or a surrogate who can bear your child. But I am critical of any ideology that fails to balance freedom against other values. And I am baffled why so many women desire a kind of sexual freedom that so obviously serves male interests.\nIt has happened because the idea has taken root in our society that sex is nothing more than a leisure activity. It has no intrinsic specialness, it is not innately different from any other kind of social interaction and can therefore be commodified without any trouble. In general terms, that has long been the male attitude to sex. But, with feminism coming to the fore, women were encouraged to think along the same lines.\nIn the first ever episode of Sex And The City, the liberated Carrie resolves to stop looking for ‘Mr Perfect’ and start enjoying herself.\nShe hooks up with a man she can’t stand, uses him solely for her pleasure and then walks away, congratulating herself for having sex ‘like a man’ and ‘feeling powerful, potent and incredibly alive. Nothing and no one could get in my way’. Liberal feminists see having sex ‘like a man’ as an obvious route by which women can free themselves from old-fashioned expectations of chastity and obedience.\nIf you believe there is nothing wrong in instrumentalising other people in pursuit of your own sexual gratification, then this makes sense. And if you believe that men and women are both physically and psychologically much the same, save for a few hang-ups absorbed from a sex-negative culture, then why wouldn’t you want women to have access to the kind of sexual fun that men have always had. I don’t doubt that there are some women who genuinely enjoy casual sex and who decide, having weighed the risks and benefits, that it is in their best interests to pursue it.\nWhat I question is the claim that a culture of casual sex is of benefit to women as a group. What is being ignored is the basic fact that men and women are not the same. Physically, almost all women are weaker than almost all men. Men can out-run women as well as out-punch them. Psychologically too, men and women are wired differently. On average, men want casual sex more often than women do, and women want committed monogamy more often than men do. In other words, there are a lot more super-horny men out there than super-horny women, and a lot more super-not-horny women than super-not-horny men.\nYet casual, hook-up culture which treats men and women as the same in their sexual appetites is now the norm among today’s adolescents and young adults. Sexual behaviour outside of traditional committed romantic relationships has become increasingly typical and socially acceptable. Although it is possible for young women to opt out, research suggests that only a minority do so.\nOn our university campuses the gospel of sexual hedonism is openly preached.\nAt Sex Weeks, freshers are given a lecture on the importance of consent and sent on their way with ‘I love consent’ badges and tote bags. They’re taught that, with consent, anything goes. Yet this simple rule is broken again and again, both through rape and the more subtle forms of coercion. The prevailing culture is a terrible deal for women. It demands that they suppress their natural instincts in order to match male sexuality and thus meet the male demand for no-strings sex. Inexperienced young women are encouraged into situations in which they are alone and drunk with horny men who are not only bigger and stronger than they are but are also likely to have been raised on the kind of porn that normalises aggression, coercion and pain.\nMany of these women are naively unaware that men are, in general, much better suited to emotionless sex and find it much easier to regard their sexual partners as disposable. Ignorant of this, women can all too easily fail to recognise that being desired is not at all the same thing as being held in high esteem. And yet this prevailing hook-up culture is endorsed by feminists as a form of liberation. Young women don’t have to look far for advice on how to overcome their perfectly normal and healthy preference for intimacy and commitment in sexual relationships.\nGuides abound with titles such as ‘How to have sex without getting emotionally attached’.\nOne suggestion I saw was just avoid making eye contact during sex. Some women are Carries, quite happy to do this, but most find it unpleasant, or even distressing. It also places them at risk. Some learn the hard way that freedom has costs. Meanwhile, we scoff at the past, believing we have inevitably progressed from those Neanderthal days of the 1950s when a home economics book offered tips to housewives on ‘how to look after your husband’. The housewife was advised that, when her husband got home from work, she should have dinner on the table, her apron off and a ribbon in her hair, and that she should always make sure to let her husband ‘talk first’.\nThis was ridiculed on social media when it was put online in 2016. How reactionary, how stupid and backward! But then take a look at a small sample of Cosmopolitan magazine guides published within the last decade: ‘30 ways to please a man’, ‘20 ways to turn on your man’, or ‘42 things to do with a naked man’.\n‘The flaunting of sexuality has been so normalised we hardly notice any more’ – in today’s sexual era society are increasingly taking provocative pictures to gain positive male attention\nIn what sense are these guides not encouraging precisely the same degree of focus on male desires, except in this case it is sexual pleasure rather than domestic comfort? Women are still expected to please men and to make it look effortless. We have smoothly transitioned from one form of feminine subservience to another, but we pretend that this one is liberation. Liberal ideology flatters women by telling us our desires are good and that we can find meaning in satisfying them, whatever the cost. I propose an alternative sexual culture that recognises other human beings as real people, invested with real value and dignity.\nFor a start, women need to avoid courting danger. Most feminists dislike this suggestion, believing that women should not be expected to be the ones who modify their behaviour. Every now and again, a police force will launch a campaign on rape prevention, with posters advising women to stick together on nights out, to keep their friends safe and so on. Invariably these efforts invite a feminist backlash.\nThey see this as victim blaming, when it’s the rapists the police should be concentrating on. Which is true. But here’s the point: rapists don’t care what feminists have to say. Posters that say ‘don’t rape’ will prevent precisely zero rapes, because rape is already illegal and would-be rapists know that. It has to be possible to say simultaneously that rape is reprehensible and that it is okay — in fact, essential — to offer advice that could help to reduce its incidence. I could hardly have more contempt for rapists.\nI fantasise with friends about marketing a range of tiny guillotines to deal with rapists in a very direct manner. And yet I’m exhausted by a feminist discourse that can’t move beyond just saying over and over that rape is bad. Yes, rape is bad. Now let’s actually do something about it. There are two ways of reducing rape. The first is to constrain would-be rapists by imprisoning them. Prosecution rates for sexual crimes are appallingly low in every part of the world — in the UK, less than one per cent result in a conviction. Convicted rapists should spend much longer in prison — life, if need be — because I have very little faith in the effectiveness of sex offender rehabilitation programmes. One such programme in England and Wales was actually found to slightly increase rates of reoffending. The other course of action is to limit opportunities for rapists.\nThey are men who are aroused by violence and unable to control their impulses when presented with a suitable victim and a suitable set of circumstances — a victim who is drunk, high, or otherwise vulnerable, the absence of witnesses and no fear of legal or social repercussions. Young women aged between 13 and 25 are prime targets, which is why if you wanted to design the perfect environment for the would-be rapist, you couldn’t do much better than a party or nightclub filled with young women who are wearing high heels (limiting mobility) and drinking or taking drugs (limiting awareness).\nIs it appalling for a person even to contemplate assaulting these women? Yes. Does that moral statement provide any protection to these women whatsoever? No. I made this mistake many, many times as a young woman and I understand the cultural pressure. But, while young women should feel free to get hammered with their girlfriends or highly trusted men, doing so among strange men will always be risky. I think we all know this, just as we all know that it’s risky for young women to hitch-hike, travel alone or go back to a strange man’s house. The sorry truth is that something in the region of 10 per cent of men pose a risk and those men aren’t always identifiable on first sight, or even after long acquaintance.\nSo my advice to young women has to be this: avoid putting yourself in a situation where you are alone with a man you don’t know or a man who gives you a bad feeling in your gut. He is almost certainly stronger and faster than you, which means the only thing standing between you and rape is that man’s self-control. This advice doesn’t protect against all forms of rape, including (but not limited to) incestuous, prison, child and marital rape. I wish I could offer advice to protect against these atrocities, but I can’t.\nOther feminists can gnash their teeth all they like, accuse me of victim blaming and insist that the burden should be on rapists, not their victims, to prevent rape. But they have no other solutions to offer. I have no doubt that, in this free-and-easy, sleeping-around sexual climate, vulnerable young women need to be cautious for their own protection. My advice to them is this: only have sex with a man if you think he would make a good father to your children. Not because you necessarily intend to have children with him, but because this is a good rule of thumb in deciding whether he’s worthy of your trust. Or whether, just like Marilyn Monroe, you may be putting yourself at risk of exploitation and worse.\nComment:\nYou may find this surprising, but despite being a man, I completely agree with Louise, I have long believed that women and ultimately society as a whole, has been sold a lie, under the guise of ’empowering women’\nOver a century ago (1903) when Emmeline Pankhurst and her friends began the suffragette movement, they were fighting for the very basic rights that women should have been entitled to by default in a civilised society. This was at a time when women were not allowed to own property, where they were little more than chattels and when the ‘rule of thumb’ was in place. (The rule of thumb was the law that permitted the beating of your wife with a stick not thicker than your thumb, yes it really existed!)\nFast forward a century and the original cause has been long lost. When feminism was hijacked in the 80s leading to what is referred to as ‘third wave feminism’ it was not about protecting women, it was about hostility and the destruction of men, but as we have been seeing in the media, this has recently given way to the ‘trans’ brigade instigating the destruction of women.\nWhat has been overlooked, in society’s haste to empower women, is that the side-effect of this has been men being absolved of responsibility to be men. There are vast numbers of men under 35 who take no responsibility, do not enter relationships and live contently with their X-Boxes and Porn!\nAt the same time, women have taken the world on their shoulders, working harder than ever, supporting themselves, raising children alone and still having to deal with the physical and emotional issues of being a woman. On top of this, there has never been a time where women or rather young women, little more than children have been sexualised and pressured, as much as they are today. One need only take a fleeting glance at Instagram to see the hundreds, thousands even millions of young girls, flaunting themselves sexually and being judged like cattle at an auction.\nWhilst romance and the ways of Eros are a natural desire, to both men and women in different ways, the commercialisation of individuals has become little more than a cynical corporate cancer, that is destroying society at its very core. There are so many different causes to this, from ridiculous divorce settlements, making marriage the choice of fools, to the notion that women can be sexual in the same manner as men, they cannot, there are consequences and invariably, it is women who are suffering the consequences as well as society as a whole.\nHistorically, all societies that have moved to the left, have ultimately been destroyed!\nThe question here is, has the quest for women to have more rights, mitigated something far more important…………the moral obligation that women should be respected???",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-erosion-of-our-society-immigration/content_720.html": "The erosion of our society – Immigration\nOver the last few years, immigration has increased exponentially as we all know. Firstly there was the mass migration that was facilitated by the last expansion of the EU on the 1st of May 2004. Citizens of Cyprus and Malta join the EU along with 8 Central and Eastern European countries — Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, were immediately granted the right to move freely throughout the block, resulting in an influx of millions of Europeans heading for the UK since that date. This migration was continual, until the Brexit referendum, began to reverse the trend and by 2020, many left during the pandemic.\nHowever, in September 2016 the General Assembly decided, through the adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, to develop a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. This was finalised and signed by all 193 members by 2018. The compact is an international agreement for continued and sustained migration. In other words, immigration will continue and signatory members have very limited means to prevent this.\nSince this date, it is not surprising that coincidentally the number of migrants arriving in the UK by boat has increased dramatically, with successive promises for action, without success. We are now at a point where the government is sourcing hotels throughout the country, to place these people, with many hotels now being full to the brim.\nThe chances of anyone being deported are very slim, in fact, many of the migrants arriving by boats, even have friends waiting for them in cars, enabling them to disappear immediately and avoid any form or identification, by simply vanishing.\nUnderstandably, many people are becoming increasingly frustrated and angry that people are arriving illegally, costing the country so much money, when the people in the UK are suffering a serious cost of living crisis.\nIn fact, I cannot remember a time when there was so much frustration, anger and hate, as there is now and this is alarming. It is my feeling, that were people’s minds and hearts are filled with hate, this does not dissipate, there is actually a serious risk that it could simply be directed to a common scapegoat, which is a socially toxic situation. This is how extremists have come to power in the past, but is the wrath of the public misdirected?\nWe need only look at the changes in demographics of some other nations to begin to see a common factor.\nAlbania has seen its population fall from 4,000,000 a decade ago to around 2,500,000 today. With 80% of Albanians wanting to leave and 51% actively planning to leave, the infrastructure has began to collapse, due to the serious decline in young men, who are all leaving.\nThere is a similar problem in Italy, Greece, Lithuania, Croatia, Poland and many more.\nThe question is thus:\nIs the immigration really an uncontrolled movement of people that the government is unable to prevent, or is the reality that the UK is actually harvesting the young men of poorer nations for its own benefit?\nIs the narrative of immigrants forcing their way in the UK, simply a smoke-screen, to avoid admitting that they are actually being encouraged to make their way here.\nThousands and thousands of migrants housed in hotels will not be there for ever, the vast majority will not be deported, in fact, little more than a token gesture, in an attempt to demonstrate that they are trying to do something about it, when in fact, they have no intention of doing anything. All these migrants will slowly make their way in the community, stretching our infrastructure even further.\nPerhaps it is time that we viewed this a little more objectively and questioned the motives of the government, rather than be turning on each other. If there is a door to a better life left wide open, we cannot blame those who make their way through it for doing so.",

We are a country in the European Union that cannot control our northern borders and Frontex cannot patrol as in other countries so we cannot take these measures taken by other countries,” he said.\n“In the absence of any permanent solution at a European level, namely the Dublin Regulation, which provides for temporary and voluntary arrangements, and because it seems that a permanent solution is not going forward, we are officially demanding a more substantial redistribution of people.”\nPetrides said that next week an official letter would be sent by Cyprus, “from me to all my counterparts but also to the European Commission” to request the relocation of a significant number of people who are protected in Cyprus,” he added.\nThe aim, Petrides said is to stop at least to some degree the disproportionate burden on Cyprus.\n“With the official response from these countries in writing, we will see to what extent this solidarity that we are seeking and that the European Union itself says is at its core, exists, Petrides said.\nAsked to comment on criticisms that Cyprus is not properly managing the large influx of migrants, the minister said the management that has been carried out by the Republic was one that has prevented a humanitarian crisis in EU countries that do not have the minimum number Cyprus.\n“So this criticism is unfair because of the overwhelming burden when you have to process a thousand applications a year means there will be delays,” he added.\nHe said Cyprus was constantly improving infrastructure and facilities but in any country the local labour market and economy as a whole can only absorb a certain number of people and “when that number is far exceeded then the system, whether it is called an asylum system or a welfare system, cannot cope sufficiently and quickly.”\nHe repeated that the criticism is unfair and suggested the media ask Labour Minister Zeta Emilianidou how much the welfare system has been burdened by the management of so many thousands of extra people.\nPetrides announced on Wednesday that his ministry would create one or two more refugee reception centres catering for 1,000 persons to respond to the increased migration flow.\nHe said there were 15,000 asylum seekers and that another 15,000 had been granted subsidiary protection status.\nOne or two more reception centres catering for a total of 1,000 people would be needed, he said.\nThe minister reiterated however that Cyprus could not host 30 to 40 reception centres and end up another “depository of souls”.\nCOMMENT\nI believe the true consequences of joining the EU are only now being felt, since Italy closed its ports to migrants and made the rescuing of migrants a criminal offence, many of them are actually being sneaked in to Cyprus. Along with many others who are being pushed out of Italy, because they have had enough.\nOver the last 2/3 years the numbers have swelled exponentially, but it has been a quiet, even distribution that many people have not noticed, but block after block of apartments in the major towns are being set aside for migrants, as the Landlords/Agents receive €150.00 per month for each one that they squeeze in, turning many blocks in to ghettos and making the lives of the residents a misery.\nThis situation has gotten totally out of control, but it has been conducted by stealth and most people are only now beginning to notice that Cyprus has been FLOODED! However, the numbers are already so great that any change in public opinion will lead to unrest. Before feeling that the appropriate thing to say is that we should take them in, then consider this, the numbers arriving have been increasing constantly, with a massive jump in June, there are millions more where they came from, how many can we take?\nIronically, the government is looking to the EU to solve this, it is in fact the EU that has created this, whilst simultaneously implementing laws, making it harder and harder to object. It is sad that our own government has to beg, cap in hand for the EU to respect our own sovereignty that we handed to them on a plate.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-case-for-neo-malthusianism/content_409.html": "The case for Neo-Malthusianism\nNeo-Malthusianism: Striking a Balance for a Sustainable Future\nIntroduction:\nIn today’s world, the topic of population growth and its impact on resources and the environment continues to be a pressing concern. While the ideas of Thomas Robert Malthus, an influential 18th-century economist, were often a subject of debate, modern thinkers have built upon his concepts to create what is known as Neo-Malthusianism. This approach aims to address the potential consequences of unchecked population growth and promote sustainable resource management. In this blog post, we will delve into the key tenets of Neo-Malthusianism and explore how it seeks to strike a balance for a sustainable future.\nThe Neo-Malthusian Perspective:\nNeo-Malthusianism, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, echoes Malthus’s concern that population growth can outpace the availability of resources. Advocates of this perspective highlight the risks of overpopulation, such as environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social unrest. Neo-Malthusians argue that unless measures are taken to control population growth, humanity may face dire consequences in the long run.\nStrategies for Sustainable Growth:\nTo address these challenges, Neo-Malthusians propose a range of strategies aimed at achieving sustainable growth. One key aspect of their approach is advocating for family planning and promoting access to contraceptives. By empowering individuals and families to make informed decisions about family size, it is believed that population growth can be managed responsibly.\nEducation and Awareness:\nAnother critical aspect of Neo-Malthusianism is education. Raising awareness about the implications of population growth and resource consumption is vital to fostering a sense of responsibility towards the environment and future generations. By promoting a culture of environmental consciousness, Neo-Malthusians hope to encourage more sustainable lifestyles and resource management practices.\nCritics and Counterarguments:\nWhile Neo-Malthusianism has its proponents, it also faces criticism from various quarters. Some argue that technological advancements and economic development can mitigate the challenges posed by population growth. They advocate for focusing on innovation and efficiency to meet the demands of a growing population.\nMoreover, critics contend that Neo-Malthusian policies, if not implemented thoughtfully, may infringe upon individual rights and autonomy. Balancing population management with personal freedoms remains an ongoing challenge for those who espouse these ideas.\nFinding a Middle Ground:\nIt is essential to recognize that addressing the issues raised by Neo-Malthusianism requires finding a middle ground between population control and economic development. Rather than adopting extreme measures, embracing a holistic approach that combines technological innovation, sustainable resource management, and responsible family planning could pave the way for a more promising future.\nConclusion:\nNeo-Malthusianism represents a modern iteration of the concerns raised by Thomas Malthus regarding population growth and its effects on resources and the environment. While the ideas have evolved over time, the core message remains relevant: achieving a sustainable future requires a delicate balance between population size and resource availability. By embracing family planning, promoting education, and implementing responsible policies, we can strive to strike this balance and create a more sustainable and prosperous world for generations to come.",

The EU has announced its intention to introduce their own version of the Rwanda plan, which would involve deporting illegal immigrants to non-EU third countries for processing, in an effort to head-off the growing far right and following protest from Ireland for the UK to take back illegal immigrants from Ireland was refused, all hailed as political triumphs.\nIrish Migrant Crisis Escalates\nThe situation in Ireland took centre stage, with the High Court declaring Britain an ‘unsafe country’, preventing the return of illegal immigrants over fears they could be sent to Rwanda. This led to a surge of migrant hotels across Ireland, much to the dismay of its citizens. This is when woke can go broke, because the immigration-osbessed Irish administration are now facing a serious backlash from the people of Ireland, who are quite rightly, at the end of their tether, after being bullied in to silence whilst they are being slowly replaced.\nCalls grew for Ireland to regain its ability to deport illegal immigrants to the UK. However, the British government firmly rejected these pleas, stating that post-Brexit, the UK must deal with the EU as a whole entity on such matters.\nIrish Backlash Intensifies\nAs the crisis deepened, former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar faced public anger over his ‘soft touch’ on illegal immigration, with reports of people shouting expletives at him on the street. Even UFC star Conor McGregor advocated a ‘military fightback’, referring to those in power as ‘human worms’.\nChristys proposed flooding hotels along the Irish border with illegal immigrants, allowing them to cross into the Republic of Ireland as a lesson to Irish politicians.\nEU’s U-Turn on Asylum Policy\nIn a stunning reversal, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s own party backed a ‘Rwanda-style plan’ to deport asylum seekers to third countries. This move came after von der Leyen had previously espoused values of inclusion and tolerance, painting a vision of Europe as ‘a union where it doesn’t matter what you look like, who you love, how you pray and where you were born.’\nThe turning point seemed to be a rally by ‘rabid Islamists’ in Hamburg, calling for an Islamic caliphate in Europe.\nLabour’s Potential U-Turn on Rwanda Plan\nWith the EU’s policy shift and early signs that the UK’s Rwanda plan may be curbing small boat crossings, Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer could face pressure to backtrack on his opposition to the scheme. Starmer had vowed to reverse the policy, describing it as ‘hugely expensive’ and dealing with only a ‘tiny number’.\n“What if the entire European Union starts doing it? He’s been completely shafted by this.”\nIt remains to be seen how the migration landscape will further evolve, but this week’s events marked a significant victory in their ongoing battle.\nIs it all beginning to fall apart?\nThe EU in dire straits, with Schengen all but abandoned as European nations begin to enforce borders as the people of Europe are sick to death of taking second place to immigrants. Since the UK left the EU, the economical status of the EU has plummeted, in 2017 it represented 22% of global trade, but by last year it was less than 15% and on target to fall below 10% by the end of this decade.\nIn a twist of political fate, the ECHR has now declared the UK an unsafe country, because there is the risk of migrants being deported to Rwanda and this has frustrated Ireland, but in parallel, the EU is also at loggerheads with the ECHR over their plans to process illegal migrants in a third country.\nIn the meantime, the loud and very vocal remainers have began to slowly withdraw as their delusional vision of a Utopian Europe is rapidly deteriorating into a Marxist mess.",

I used to share news constantly, just about anything that came up in the media, that was in the category of news, current affairs, etc. would end up on my website via an RSS feed and subsequently shared automatically to Twitter and Facebook.\nAs I began to spend more time on my business a few years ago, I had not time for posting news, as I was not earning from it, so I rebuilt my website and stopped posting en-mass, and began to post as normal.\nYears later, I decided to stand as a candidate for Reform UK, I had kept my Twitter account, because I know I have never said anything to offend anyone, but I had not factored the determination of the media to find a story.\nOut of 71,000+ posts, I understand that there were half a dozen that they picked up on, a post about Bill Gates, the Rothschilds, George Soros, David Icke and Hitler. They accept that I never commented or indicated an opinion or support for these in any way, but presented in the way that they have, the could be damaging.\nHaving said that, they did not bother to look at other posts that report stories that are anti-Semitic. Indeed, on this website alone, I have written several articles supporting Israel, explaining the creation of the state and why it is a legal sovereign state, but the media seemed to have had no interest in this whatsoever.\nI can’t take credit for these posts below, as they were posted automatically, but they do confirm that news was being posted unbiased and randomly. As I have said to those in the media who I have spoken to, if mainstream media report on a historical event that is horrid, does that mean that they support it?\nHistorical events that are evil must not be forgotten, people who continue to incite hate must be called out, but there again, that was my personal logic and all elements of logic and decency seem to be abandoned when the media is out to tarnish a candidate, especially a candidate standing for Reform UK.\nNone of the journalists I have spoken to took any notice of the content on this website, or even referenced to it.\nThe Bio in my Twitter clearly stated, “Tweets DO NOT reflect my opinion in any way”\nHowever, it seems that sadly our media are more concerned about scoring points, rather than conducting some research and establishing my character, they have not even taken the time to look through this website, where the articles I have written speak for themselves and I stand by them.",

This article delves into the key points raised during the conference and Reform UK’s proposed solutions.\nThe Broken State of Britain:\nTice opened the conference by highlighting the disillusionment among voters due to the perceived failure of successive Conservative governments. He argued that after 14 years of Conservative rule, the country is in disarray, with public faith in traditional parties eroding. Reform UK asserts itself as a beacon of change, offering new solutions and bold leadership to address Britain’s myriad problems.\n**Labour’s Betrayal of the Working Class:**\nTice didn’t mince words in accusing Labour of betraying its roots and catering solely to the ‘woke managerial middle class’. He lambasted Labour’s lack of concrete plans and solutions for the working class, pointing out their neglect of crucial issues such as the Mine Workers pension fund scandal.\nHealthcare Crisis:\nOne of the key areas of focus for Reform UK is healthcare reform. Despite the NHS being hailed as a symbol of national pride, Tice argued that the reality is starkly different. With record funding failing to alleviate crises in waiting lists, staffing shortages, and subpar outcomes in areas like Cancer Care and heart disease, Reform UK asserts the urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system.\nReform UK’s Healthcare Agenda:\nReform UK’s healthcare agenda aims for zero waiting lists within two years, a goal that Tice acknowledges as ambitious but necessary. To achieve this, the party proposes incentivizing frontline healthcare workers with tax relief and recruiting logistics experts from the private sector to improve productivity. Additionally, they advocate for utilizing the independent healthcare sector to alleviate strain on the NHS.\nLabour’s Lacklustre Healthcare Plans:\nIn contrast to Reform UK’s bold proposals, Tice criticized Labour’s lack of a coherent healthcare strategy. He derided their ‘secret plan’ to impose VAT on independent healthcare, which he argued would exacerbate pressure on the NHS and hinder reforms. Tice questioned Labour’s commitment to healthcare, citing their disproportionate allocation of funds to green initiatives over healthcare reforms.\nFunding Reform:\nAddressing concerns over funding, Tice outlined a plan to reallocate resources from the government’s Net Zero agenda to healthcare reforms. By reprioritizing expenditures, Reform UK aims to secure the necessary funding for their ambitious healthcare proposals.\nConclusion:\nIn concluding the conference, Tice reiterated the imperative need for reform in Britain, highlighting Reform UK’s commitment to addressing pressing issues and providing real solutions. He called upon voters to consider the stark contrast between Reform UK’s bold agenda and Labour’s purported neglect of the working class. Ultimately, Tice argued, the choice between Reform UK’s vision for a reformed Britain and Labour’s agenda lies at the heart of the nation’s future.\nIn summary\n- Tice highlights voter disillusionment after years of Conservative rule, citing Reform UK as a new solution.\n- Labour accused of ignoring working-class issues, exemplified by neglect of the Mine Workers pension scandal.\n- Despite NHS pride, Tice points to record waiting lists, staff shortages, and poor outcomes in Cancer Care, urging for reform.\n- Aiming for zero waiting lists in two years, Reform UK proposes tax incentives for healthcare workers and collaboration with the private sector.\n- Criticism of Labour’s VAT proposal on independent healthcare, seen as detrimental to NHS and lacking compared to Reform UK’s bold strategy.\n- Tice suggests reallocating funds from the government’s Net Zero agenda to finance healthcare reforms.\n- Tice emphasises the urgency for reform, urging voters to consider the contrast between Reform UK’s agenda and Labour’s purported neglect.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_understanding-the-windsor-framework/content_991.html": "Understanding the Windsor Framework\nUnveiling the Windsor Framework: A New Era for UK Trade and Northern Ireland\nIntroduction\nOn the 27th of February, a historic agreement was reached between the United Kingdom and the European Union, ushering in a transformative set of arrangements known as the Windsor Framework. These arrangements aim to restore the smooth flow of trade within the UK internal market, safeguard Northern Ireland’s place in the Union, and address the democratic deficit that had been a central issue within the original Northern Ireland Protocol. The agreement was formally adopted at the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee on March 24th, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing Brexit process.\nThe Path Forward\nAs part of the UK government’s commitment to supporting businesses during the implementation of these groundbreaking arrangements, this blog post provides an overview of how the Windsor Framework will work in practice. It is important to note that further guidance and details will be continually updated as they become available.\nThe implementation of the Windsor Framework will occur in stages, extending into 2025, to ensure that businesses have sufficient time to adapt to the new arrangements. Some aspects of the framework have already come into force, while others are scheduled to take effect in the coming years.\nImmediate Changes\nAs of May 1st, 2023, a temporary VAT zero-rate was introduced in Northern Ireland for the domestic installation of solar panels, insulation, heat pumps, and other energy-saving materials, a relief that was previously blocked by the Protocol. Additionally, a permanent scheme has been introduced to support the movement and sale of second-hand cars from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Moreover, a new reimbursement scheme for EU duty paid on “at-risk” goods sold or used outside the EU was launched on June 30th, 2023.\nUpcoming Milestones\nFrom September 30th, 2023, a new UK Internal Market Scheme will expand the scope of businesses benefiting from the new arrangements, including the removal of EU tariffs. Simultaneously, “green lane” sanitary and phytosanitary arrangements will take effect, streamlining the movement of agrifood retail products and allowing plants and seed potatoes to move smoothly into Northern Ireland.\nBy September 2024, the full “green lane” will be operational for all goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, minimizing bureaucracy and customs requirements. New arrangements for parcel movements between these regions will also simplify customs declarations for deliveries to consumers.\nIn 2025, a new framework for the supply of medicines into Northern Ireland will be established, ensuring that medicines approved by UK authorities are readily available. This will enable a unified licensing and packaging system for medicines across the United Kingdom.\nThroughout this transition, existing grace periods and practical arrangements will be maintained to provide businesses with certainty and a smooth shift to the new framework.\nContinual Updates and Support\nFor detailed information on each of these new arrangements, please refer to the linked guidance pages provided throughout this post. The UK government remains committed to updating this guidance regularly, in addition to engaging with industry and stakeholders to ensure a seamless transition.\nConclusion\nThe Windsor Framework represents a significant step forward in the ongoing efforts to redefine the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. It is designed to streamline trade, protect Northern Ireland’s place in the Union, and address key issues that emerged during the Brexit process. As these arrangements are gradually implemented, businesses and stakeholders will play a vital role in shaping the future of trade in this dynamic region.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-real-lessons-to-learn-from-the-cypriot-serial-killings/content_430.html": "OVER the past two years, 22 women from the Philippines have gone missing in Cyprus. A 35-year-old man, Nicos Metaxas, has so far confessed to the killing seven missing women and children. Mary Rose (38) and Arian Palanas Lozano (28) were the first victims to be identified.\nLocals were aghast at the news, expressing their shock that something like this could happen in a place like theirs. They emphasised how ‘close-knit’ the community is and how everyone knows and looks out for each other.\nProfessor Elizabeth Yardley and I argue that the reality is something altogether different. Whilst the perpetrator chose to end the lives of these women, social and cultural forces that continue to divide communities facilitated it.\nMary Rose went missing in May 2018. She and her daughter had gone to spend the night in Nicosia and were never seen again. They were thought to have simply left the island. The subsequent disappearance of Arian in July raised questions about the level of urgency in the police investigations. Had the police taken Mary’s disappearance more seriously, perhaps Arian’s death could have been prevented. Her case was classed as a non-police matter.\nCypriot police have announced that they expect to find more victims. As such, the alleged perpetrator has been labelled a serial killer – someone who kills three or more victims in separate incidents in a period greater than 30 days (Wilson, Yardley, Lynes, 2015). He hunted for victims online and strangled them as he sexually assaulted them. To him these women were objects, simply there for his own gratification, fulfilling his need for complete power and domination. He took photographs of the body disposal sites, mementoes (Miller, 2014) which enabled him to relive the events and continue to exert control over his victims after their deaths.\nThis killer devalued and demeaned Mary and Arian. But so did Cypriot society. These women have been described as ‘domestic workers’. That their relationship to the economy is the main criteria upon which they are defined is very revealing. They existed on the margins, fulfilling a role in Cypriot society without ever really being part of it. They were women in the shadows. Women who went unseen. Women who didn’t matter – until they became victims. It’s a tragedy that the ‘victim’ label carries more status than that of ‘domestic worker’ or ‘migrant’. But Mary and Arian were not just domestic workers. They were mothers, sisters, daughters and friends. Women with hopes, aspirations and plans.\nOne of us was born and raised in the south Mediterranean and believe that Cypriot society is in a state of interpretive denial (Cohen, 2001) about migrant domestic workers. They know these women are there, they see their vulnerability – but they respond in ways that justify not acting on what they see. This runs completely counter to the principles and spirit of south-east Mediterranean culture.\nXenios Zeus, the ancient Greek God of hospitality emphasised the importance of accommodating travellers. Hospitality is deeply rooted in our consciousness – a moral mandate. Xenios Zeus’s philosophy is still very much embraced, this part of the world, after all, is heavily reliant upon the tourist trade. It attracts travellers from Europe and the USA whose holidays are preceded by much daydreaming about the sandy beaches, blue seas and mouth-watering cuisine of the region. However, it seems that some travellers are more valuable – and valued – than others.\nTourists are welcomed with open arms as they burn through their holiday spending money in bars, restaurants and tavernas. They are warmly waved off at the end of their vacations, ‘Please come again next year’. Migrant domestic workers do not receive quite the same reception. They live behind closed doors. A parallel population. Present and absent. Working in the basement of the economy. Taking on responsibilities without acquiring many rights. There but unseen.\nInterpretive denial is not a Cypriot thing. It’s endemic across all neoliberal political economies of the world. We prioritise wealth and ‘liberty’ above all else, under the illusion that we are free to thrive and achieve success if only we are prepared to work hard enough. But the reality is that some are freer than others, some have more choices than others, some have more protection from harm.\nAs Wilson (2007) argues, serial killers target the vulnerable and the marginalised, those we don’t notice or choose not to see. It is no coincidence that sex workers, gay men, elderly people and young people who have run away – or been pushed away – from home are among the groups targeted most often by perpetrators. In these cases, it is the victim rather than the offender who becomes the other.\nMuch discussion has focused upon the alleged racism of the Cypriot police. However, this is merely a symptom of an underlying disease. If the police did not provide the service that Mary and Arian deserved simply because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin then this must be investigated and those involved held accountable. However, actions can only grow from values and beliefs. When we judge people, when we see ourselves as above them, when we don’t embrace them into our culture, when they are separate from ‘the rest of us’ they become vulnerable to the worst kinds of harm. For as long as we continue to other them, women like Mary and Arian will continue to be preyed upon and this will not be the last case of its kind that we will see. It will simply be the tip of an iceberg.\nBy Lucas Danos and Elizabeth Yardley – The Cyprus Mail\nLucas Danos and Professor Elizabeth Yardley are Birmingham City University Criminologists\nCOMMENT\nI actually agree with the opinion of the writers, this has not just uncovered a form of institutional and cultural prejudice and discrimination. As the writers have stated, this is just the tip of the iceberg and runs very deep, it is one of the reasons that the island was divided and remains divided, yet nothing has been done to change attitudes withing Cypriots of different ethnic backgrounds, let alone migrant workers.\nCyprus may have joined the EU, but it is only European in name, culturally, it still has a long way to go.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_nhs/content_86.html": "NHS\nOur NHS needs urgent Reform.\nWe must make it a national endeavour to get to Zero NHS Waiting Lists in 2 years. This can be done, but only with a fresh, bold, can-do approach. Healthcare must remain free at the point of use.\nWhilst we treasure some of the front line care provided by the NHS, we must be honest. The NHS is in crisis: patients are suffering. Too often the care lets people down badly. Waiting lists are at record highs. Hospital beds have been cut from 300,000 to 141,000 while the population has grown by 20%.\nHundreds die every week because of delays in Accident and Emergency. Ambulance waiting times are at record highs. This has contributed to an excess deaths crisis and some of the worst health outcomes in Europe.\nThis is not about funding. Per head of population, NHS spending is similar to other western countries. Sadly, the NHS is being let down by incompetent management, bureaucracy, waste, cover-ups and scandals. The NHS has a crisis in leadership. This will take time to fix. It is about structure and motivation.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nTransform Doctor and Nurse Availability.\nAll frontline NHS and social care staff to pay zero basic rate tax for 3 years. This will help retain existing staff and attract back many who have recently left. We want the best staff with patients, not in offices behind desks or retired.\nUse Independent Healthcare Capacity.\nCut waiting lists by using UK & overseas providers. The vast majority do not mind who delivers the cure, we just want the pain gone. This independent sector includes many not for profit health providers that provide some of the best care. Organisations such as Nuffield Health and Marie Curie, which provides end of life cancer care are charities. We want to encourage more of these organisations to end the NHS crisis.\nTax Relief of 20% on all Private Healthcare and Insurance.\nWe will incentivise people who can afford to pay more. This will improve care for all as pressure on the NHS is significantly reduced. Those who rely on the NHS will enjoy faster better care. Independent healthcare capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs. Firms should be encouraged to offer staff health insurance – this will become standard. Labour will instead add VAT on independent healthcare, which will make the NHS worse off.\nDoctor and Nurse Training.\nEnd training caps for all UK medical students. Write off student fees pro rata per year over 10 years of NHS service for all doctors, nurses & medical staff.\nThereafter:\nPut Patients in Charge With a New NHS Voucher Scheme..\nPatients will receive a voucher for private treatment if they can’t see a GP within 3 days. For a consultant, the time limit would be 3 weeks. For an operation, 9 weeks.\nCut Waste, Bureaucracy and Unnecessary Managers.\nFocus on results, not targets. Nail down better prices using economies of scale. Better IT for example. Review all Private Finance Contracts in NHS. Significant savings potential. Remove Lifetime Cap on NHS Pensions. This causes 70% of surgeons to reduce their hours.\nSave A&E.\nGP waiting lists are hitting A&E. Cut waiting times with a campaign of ‘Pharmacy First, GP Second, A&E Last’. More beds in A & E and other parts of the NHS are essential.\nExcess Deaths and Vaccine Harms Public Inquiry.\nExcess deaths are nearly as high as they were during the Covid pandemic. Young people are overrepresented.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_eu-implements-stricter-measures-russians-no-longer-allowed-to-bring-cars-into-the-eu/content_971.html": "EU Implements Stricter Measures – Russians No Longer Allowed to Bring Cars into the EU\nIn a recent development that sent shockwaves across Europe, Russian nationals have been dealt a major blow as they can no longer bring their cars into the European Union. The news came to light on September 11th after the European Commission clarified an update to the EU sanctions policy, which now mandates the confiscation of vehicles with Russian license plates.\nThe European Commission’s update, outlined in a document titled “Frequently asked questions on import, purchase, and transfer of listed goods” dated September 8, 2023, addressed a crucial question: Can Russian nationals temporarily bring personal goods and vehicles into the EU under the sanctions regime imposed on Moscow? The answer was an unequivocal “no.”\nThis new restriction applies irrespective of whether these vehicles are intended for private or commercial use. It also encompasses all vehicles bearing Russian license plates, regardless of the duration of their stay in the EU and the customs procedures they undergo.\nThis recent update goes beyond a prior ban on Russians bringing what the EU categorizes as “luxury” cars into the EU, which was part of the 11th package of sanctions. Luxury cars, according to EU criteria, are those with a value exceeding €50,000 or with an engine capacity of over 1,900 cm³. It also includes all electric and hybrid cars, regardless of their other specifications.\nOne aspect left unclear by the new sanctions policy update is the status of cars owned by Russian nationals that already exist within EU territory. Many EU countries have witnessed an influx of cars with Russian number plates, notably Bulgaria, where an estimated 300,000 Russian nationals have invested in real estate and continue to drive their Russian-registered vehicles.\nAmidst the confusion, Commission spokesperson Daniel Ferrie emphasized that member states are expected to rigorously enforce the ban on car imports, even if the vehicle only crosses the border for tourism or short-term purposes. The statement left open the question of whether exceptions might be considered for Russian nationals who permanently reside in a member state or hold refugee or humanitarian status.\nThis development has far-reaching implications for Russian nationals in the EU and raises questions about the broader impact of the EU’s sanctions policy on various sectors and industries. As this situation continues to evolve, it remains crucial to monitor any further updates and clarifications from the European Commission and the member states regarding the status of Russian-owned vehicles on EU soil.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-legacy-of-afghanistan-reflecting-on-two-years-since-withdrawal/content_990.html": "The Legacy of Afghanistan – Reflecting on Two Years Since Withdrawal\nIt has been two years since the withdrawal from Afghanistan, a country that became synonymous with a complex web of events triggered by the devastating 9/11 attacks. The aftermath of those attacks led to a series of events that shaped the course of history, involving Saudi Arabian figures, Western military interventions, and a struggle for stability that remains relevant today. As we reflect on this milestone, it’s crucial to examine the costs, the outcomes, and the lessons that can be drawn from this tumultuous period.\n**The Aftermath of 9/11 and Western Intervention**\nIn the wake of the 9/11 attacks carried out by individuals inspired by a Saudi Arabian origin, the world witnessed a seismic shift in geopolitics. The subsequent invasion of Afghanistan was an effort spearheaded by the United States and supported by its allies, including the United Kingdom, driven by a desire to eliminate the threat of terrorism and bring justice to those responsible for the attacks.\nThe coalition’s efforts were relentless, spanning over two decades and costing staggering amounts both in terms of lives lost and financial resources expended. For the UK, a total expenditure of 28 billion pounds was incurred, resulting in the tragic loss of 454 troops and over seven and a half thousand injuries. Meanwhile, the United States spent a staggering 950 billion dollars, with 2,300 soldiers losing their lives, including 13 in a heart-wrenching suicide bomb attack during the final stages of the retreat at Kabul Airport.\n**The Broken Promises and Human Cost**\nOne of the promises made by the US and NATO was to provide financial support to Afghanistan’s own security forces, pledging four billion dollars annually until 2024. Tragically, these forces eventually crumbled, leaving a void that the Taliban seized upon. This crumbling was accompanied by an even more significant loss – Afghan civilians. Around 111,000 were injured or killed, and a staggering 64,100 Afghan soldiers sacrificed their lives in the pursuit of a stable future for their nation.\nBeyond the battlefields, the human cost extended to Afghan civilians displaced from their homes. Approximately 5.9 million people found themselves without a home due to the conflict, and approximately 70,000 sought refuge in the UK. However, the process wasn’t without flaws – many who had assisted the Western forces were left stranded, their information carelessly exposed by the foreign office, putting their lives in danger at the hands of the Taliban.\n**A Landscape Transformed by Loss and Inefficiency**\nThe aftermath of the conflict revealed a transformed Afghanistan, one grappling with the aftermath of a long war. The Taliban, notorious for their radical Islamist ideology, returned to power, dealing a significant blow to the progress that had been achieved in terms of women’s rights and education. The extensive infrastructure built with Western funds also ironically facilitated the Taliban’s resurgence, as they harnessed these very resources to reclaim control over the country.\nThe financial toll of the war was monumental, with the US investing a staggering 131 billion dollars in reconstruction projects, inadvertently enabling the Taliban’s resurgence. Additionally, the Taliban found themselves in possession of around seven billion dollars worth of abandoned US military equipment, amplifying their capabilities.\n**A Look Back with Mixed Emotions**\nAs we gaze back upon the legacy of the Afghan war, it’s difficult to ignore the emotions it elicits. The sacrifice of hundreds of young soldiers, coupled with a colossal financial investment, has led to a sense of loss and questioning. Many have questioned the true purpose of the war, as the Taliban’s resurgence paints a grim picture of the lasting impact.\nIn the midst of these reflections, the sentiment expressed by Mrs. Whitaker, who lost her son in the conflict, rings especially true. “Our sons may have been cannon fodder to him, but they were our flesh and blood.” This statement encapsulates the human toll, the lives that were sacrificed for a cause that now seems blurred and uncertain.\n**Conclusion: A Glimpse Into the Shadows of War**\nTwo years after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, we stand at the intersection of reflection and understanding. The legacy of this war is one of sacrifice, missed opportunities, and the painful realization that geopolitical interventions can be fraught with unintended consequences. The lessons of Afghanistan are a reminder that the complexities of global affairs demand nuanced strategies and a vigilant awareness of the potential repercussions that can span generations.\nAs we continue to grapple with the fallout of Afghanistan, it’s essential to recognize the value of learning from history, ensuring that decisions that shape lives and destinies are made with the utmost care and consideration. The legacy of Afghanistan, for better or worse, will continue to cast its shadows upon the course of global events for years to come.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-demise-of-the-two-party-system/content_926.html": "The Demise of the Two-Party System\nA Looming Electoral Catastrophe\nBritain’s venerable two-party system, a cornerstone of its political landscape for centuries, is teetering on the brink of collapse. The upcoming vote may well deliver the fatal blow, ushering in an era of unprecedented political uncertainty and constitutional crisis. As the nation grapples with this seismic shift, it becomes increasingly apparent that the current electoral framework is woefully ill-equipped to reflect the true will of the people.\nThe United Kingdom finds itself in the peculiar position of a populace voting as though it were operating under a system of proportional representation, whilst the archaic First Past the Post (FPTP) mechanism continues to deliver Soviet-style majorities to parties that fail to secure even half of the popular vote. This glaring disparity between the electorate’s intentions and the resultant distribution of parliamentary seats has reached a critical juncture, threatening to undermine the very foundations of British democracy.\nShould the most recent polling data prove accurate, the 4th of July may well go down in history as the day that finally compels even the most stalwart conservatives to embrace the concept of proportional representation. The projections paint a picture of political absurdity: the Labour Party, despite failing to crack the 50 per cent threshold of the popular vote, stands poised to enjoy a Soviet-style majority in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party, though securing the second-highest share of votes, finds itself languishing in third place in terms of seat allocation. In a further twist of electoral irony, the Liberal Democrats, having garnered the third-largest share of votes, may find themselves on the cusp of forming His Majesty’s Opposition. Perhaps most egregiously, the Reform Party, despite attracting a not insignificant portion of the electorate, faces the prospect of securing precisely zero seats in Parliament.\nFor decades, right-wing politicians and pundits have staunchly defended the FPTP system, arguing that it serves the dual purpose of rooting Members of Parliament in their local constituencies whilst simultaneously providing stable national governance. Proportional representation, they contended, was best left to continental Europeans, particularly the Italians, who seemed to relish being governed by chaotic coalitions cobbled together from party lists.\nHowever, what the FPTP system was never intended to do – and what it now threatens to accomplish – is to create a de facto dictatorship. A Labour landslide of the magnitude currently projected would amount to precisely that: an unchecked concentration of power in the hands of a single party that failed to secure a majority of votes. Under the British constitutional system, a parliamentary majority wields nearly unlimited power to enact its agenda (as evidenced by the Brexit process). A left-wing government facing only token opposition would have carte blanche to steer the country in a decidedly leftward direction for a full five-year term, with nary a check nor balance to temper its ambitions – despite the fact that the majority of the country will have either voted against such a government or abstained from voting altogether.\nThe Liberal Democrats, no strangers to the vagaries of the FPTP system, might be tempted to adopt a “turnabout is fair play” attitude, pointing out that they endured similar electoral injustices throughout the 1980s. During that era, despite consistently securing approximately a quarter of the popular vote, the party was rewarded with a paltry number of parliamentary seats. When they clamoured for proportional representation, their pleas fell on deaf Conservative ears, met with derision and dismissal.\nHowever, the present political landscape differs markedly from that of the 1980s. The old SDP/Liberal Alliance, whilst securing a significant portion of the popular vote, consistently placed third behind Labour and the Conservatives. Thus, while their seat allocation may have been disproportionately low, it nevertheless reflected their failure to supplant Labour as the dominant party of the urban working class.\nIn stark contrast, the current possibility of the Conservatives and Reform Party collectively winning nearly as many votes as Labour, yet securing only a handful of seats – or potentially none at all – is patently absurd. Such an outcome would serve as incontrovertible evidence that the British constitution is no longer capable of accurately expressing the will of the voters. The situation would be akin to being governed by a council of bishops long after the majority of the population had ceased attending church – an anachronistic vestige of a bygone era, utterly divorced from the realities of contemporary British society.\nAt the heart of this electoral conundrum lies a fundamental problem: while the two-party system is in its death throes, the constitutional framework continues to prop up this increasingly obsolete political paradigm. A mere five years ago, the Labour Party suffered historically abysmal results; now, it is the Conservatives’ turn to face electoral annihilation. This rapid oscillation between extremes is symptomatic of a deeper malaise afflicting the British body politic: a governing class that is perceived as incompetent, out of touch, and utterly devoid of charisma. Indeed, one might argue that being governed by a council of vicars would prove more compelling to the electorate than the current crop of political leaders.\nIn response to this crisis of representation, smaller parties are emerging to give voice to various segments of society: the young, the disenfranchised, and the discontented. The Reform Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, the Scottish National Party, and perhaps even the Workers Party are all vying for a place in the political spotlight. As a result, British voters are increasingly behaving as though they live under a system of proportional representation, seeking out new ideas and fresh faces that ought to result in a kaleidoscopic House of Commons, reflecting the true diversity of political opinion in the country.\nYet, due to the vagaries of the FPTP system, the electorate is instead confronted with results more befitting the mass-membership party system of 1945 – a Labour landslide that wildly exaggerates the actual level of support for Sir Keir Starmer in the country. It bears emphasising that Sir Keir, for all his qualities, is no Clement Attlee, and the current Labour Party bears little resemblance to the transformative force that reshaped post-war Britain.\nPerhaps the most curious aspect of this impending constitutional crisis is the near-certainty that Sir Keir Starmer, should he ascend to the office of Prime Minister, will do precious little to address the fundamental flaws in the electoral system. While he may pay lip service to democratic reform – perhaps advocating for votes for 16-year-olds or tinkering with the composition of the House of Lords – it is nigh inconceivable that any leader would willingly dismantle an electoral system that hands them quasi-Napoleonic powers, even as the public grows increasingly cynical about the ability of any single party to effectively address the myriad challenges facing the nation.\nAs Britain stands on the precipice of this electoral revolution, it behoves all citizens, regardless of political affiliation, to engage in a serious and sustained dialogue about the future of their democracy. The time has come to consider whether the FPTP system, for all its historical merits, remains fit for purpose in an era of increasingly fragmented political loyalties and complex, multifaceted policy challenges.\nThe upcoming vote may well serve as a watershed moment in British political history, forcing a long-overdue reckoning with the limitations of the current electoral system. As the two-party paradigm crumbles, it is incumbent upon the British people to demand a more representative, responsive, and ultimately more democratic system of governance – one that truly reflects the will of the electorate and ensures that all voices are heard in the halls of power.\nThe fate of British democracy hangs in the balance. The question remains: will the nation seize this moment of crisis as an opportunity for meaningful reform, or will it allow an increasingly antiquated system to further erode public faith in the democratic process? The answer to this question will shape the course of British politics for generations to come.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_court-issues-fresh-remand-against-self-confessed-serial-killer/content_767.html": "The Nicosia district court on Monday issued a fresh remand order against 35-year-old suspected serial killer Nikos Metaxas to allow police to continue investigations into premeditated murder, kidnapping, and rape.\nThe 35-year-old, who appeared before the court once again without a lawyer, was escorted by members of the counter-terrorism unit.\nRequesting a fresh remand order, lead investigator Ioannis Yiorkadjis outlined the progress of the continuing investigation into multiple crimes connected with the suspect, which involve the murder of seven victims and one rape charge.\nSo far, police have taken 450 statements and collected 355 pieces of evidence. Some 100 additional statements remain to be collected, Yiorkadjis said. Police have also found a third car belonging to the 35-year-old, which he used in 2016. Authorities have also tracked down where the suspect found the cement blocks used to weigh down the body-containing suitcases into the red lake in Mitsero.\nYiorkadjis added that police are continuing investigations into Metaxas’ phone data, as well as into the allegation of rape of a Filipino woman in 2017, which the 35-year-old denied. In a previous hearing, Yiorkadjis had told the court that Metaxas handed police a 10-page handwritten confession, outlining six murders, five women and one child aged eight. He denied killing a second child, six, claiming she had choked on her own vomit.\nFive bodies have so far been found at three locations, including a mine shaft in Mitsero, a toxic red lake near the mine, and a firing range in Orounta. On May 5, the second out of the three bodies that Metaxas told police he dumped in the red lake in suitcases was found by search crews.\nThe UK-based Cypriot state pathologist Andreas Marnerides, who was among the five-member team of British experts who had assisted in the investigations earlier in the month, participated in the post-mortem that was conducted on the retrieved body along with two other local state pathologists on Monday.\nThe body is believed to be eight-year-old Elena Natalia, daughter of Livia Florentina, 36, from Romania, whose body is believed to be that retrieved from the red lake on April 28.\nTissue was taken for histopathological examinations at the time while the post mortem will be continued at a later stage, police said.\nSearch crews continued scouring the red lake on Monday for a third suitcase, believed to contain 30-year-old Marricar Valdez Arguiola from the Philippines. The search for the suitcase ended unsuccessfully on Sunday, reportedly due to the limited visibility in the waters of the red lake as a result of the waist-high mud.\nAccording to the Cyprus News Agency, should search crews fail to locate the third suitcase on Monday, the search will continue with an additional diver, as only one has entered the lake so far.\nThe sonar technology is also expected to return to the USA on Tuesday, as it has already provided search crews with underwater scans of both the red lake and Memi lake in the Xyliatos reservoir area, where Metaxas told police he dumped the body of six-year-old Sierra Graze Seucalliuc, which has yet to be found.\nSierra is the daughter of Mary Rose Tiburcio, 39, from the Philippines, whose body was the first of Metaxas’ victims to be found on April 14 in the Mitsero mine shaft. Mother and daughter Sierra went missing last May.\nLast week, fire chief Marcos Trangolas announced that should the current search strategy fail to locate the two remaining bodies, a ground penetrating radar will be employed.\nCOMMENT\n“The 35-year-old, who appeared before the court once again without a lawyer, was escorted by members of the counter-terrorism unit.”\nThis is worrying, whether he wants a solicitor or not, they are gathering too much without adequate legal representation. I don’t think people realise how important that is, because they may be setting themselves up for a shock.\nThe importance of good legal representation for the accused is to ensure that the prosecution is forced to prove their case, bare in mind that the burden of proof lays with the prosecution. In this instance, he should have been assigned the BEST legal representation possible, not to get him off, but to ensure that every step of the way, the prosecution is forced to account for their case and that every shred of evidence is gathered in accordance with the law and presented in accordance of the law, to ensure a safe conviction.\nIf this is not done, there could be a terrible shock down the road in the ECHR and for those who think otherwise, confessions CAN be revoked, they CAN be discredited and they CAN be thrown out. I just hope that in their hast to cover up their incompetence and negligence, that they do not end up with an unsafe conviction and rest assured, that despite the overwhelming evidence that we believe that they have, anything is possible if the case is not watertight….and they are dealing with PSYCHOPATH, I still wonder, is he confessing or misleading? I’m still not convinced.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_istanbul-pogrom-1955/content_210.html": "The events of September 1955\nThe Istanbul pogrom, also known as the Istanbul riots or September events (Greek: Σεπτεμβριανά Septemvriana, “Events of September”; Turkish: 6–7 Eylül Olayları, “Events of September 6–7”), were organized mob attacks directed primarily at Istanbul’s Greek minority on 6–7 September 1955. The riots were orchestrated by the Tactical Mobilisation Group, the seat of Operation Gladio’s Turkish branch; the Counter-Guerrilla, and National Security Service, the precursor of today’s National Intelligence Organisation. The events were triggered by the false news that the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki, in northern Greece—the house where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had been born in 1881—had been bombed the day before. A bomb planted by a Turkish usher at the consulate, who was later arrested and confessed, incited the events. The Turkish press, conveying the news in Turkey, was silent about the arrest and instead insinuated that Greeks had set off the bomb.\nA Turkish mob, most of which had been trucked into the city in advance, assaulted Istanbul’s Greek community for nine hours. Although the mob did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, over a dozen people died during or after the attacks as a result of beatings and arson. Armenians and Jews were also harmed. The police remained mostly ineffective, and the violence continued until the government declared martial law in İstanbul and called in the army to put down the riots.\nThe pogrom greatly accelerated emigration of ethnic Greeks from Turkey, and the Istanbul region in particular. The Greek population of Turkey declined from 119,822 persons in 1927, to about 7,000 in 1978. In Istanbul alone, the Greek population decreased from 65,108 to 49,081 between 1955 and 1960. The 2008 figures released by the Turkish Foreign Ministry placed the number of Turkish citizens of Greek descent at 3,000–4,000; while according to the Human Rights Watch (2006) their number was estimated to be 2,500.\nSome see the attacks as a continuation of a process of Turkification that started with the decline of the Ottoman Empire,rather than being a contemporary, bilateral issue. To back this claim they adduce the fact that roughly 40% of the properties attacked belonged to other minorities. The pogrom has been compared in some media to the Kristallnacht, the 1938 pogrom against Jews throughout Nazi Germany. Historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas has written that in his view, despite the small number of deaths in the pogrom, the riots met the “intent to destroy in whole or in part” criterion of the Genocide Convention.\nConstantinople (modern Istanbul) was the capital of the Byzantine Empire until 1453, when the city was conquered by Ottoman forces. A large indigenous Greek community continued to live in the multi-ethnic Ottoman capital city. The city’s Greek population, particularly the Phanariotes, came to play a significant role in the social and economic life of the city and in the political and diplomatic life of the Islamic but multi-ethnic, multi-religious Ottoman Empire in general. This continued even after rebellions against Ottoman rule in Greece and the establishment of an independent Greek state in 1829, although during the Greek War of Independence massacres against local Greek communities occurred. A number of ethnic Armenians and Greeks, who served in the Ottoman Imperial diplomatic service and were even leading politicians in the 19th and early 20th century, were targeted.\nFollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the population exchange agreement signed between Greece and Turkey resulted in the uprooting of all Greeks in modern Turkey (and Turks in Greece) from where many of them had lived for centuries. But due to the Greeks’ strong emotional attachment to their first capital as well as the importance of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for Greek and worldwide orthodoxy, the Greek population of Istanbul was specifically exempted and allowed to stay in place. Nevertheless, this population began to decline, as evinced by demographic statistics.\nPunitive Turkish nationalist exclusivist measures, such as a 1932 parliamentary law, barred Greek citizens living in Turkey from a series of 30 trades and professions from tailoring and carpentry to medicine, law and real estate. The Varlık Vergisi tax imposed in 1942 also served to reduce the economic potential of Greek businesspeople in Turkey.\nContext\nIn early 1950s, Turkey had close relations with Greece. In 1952, Paul of Greece became the first Greek Monarch to visit a Turkish head of state, which was soon followed by Turkish president Celal Bayar’s visit to Greece. However, the relations soured starting in 1953, when the armed struggle of the Greek Cypriots aiming for Enosis, annexation of Cyprus by Greece, started. Soon after, Georgios Grivas, a retired general of the Greek Army formed EOKA. This turn of events was politically exploited in Turkey by the Turkish nationalists of Kibris Türktür Cemiyeti (Cyprus is Turkish) organization, although EOKA had never targeted the Turkish Cypriot community before the anti-Greek pogrom events of September 1955.\nGreece appealed in 1954 to the United Nations to demand self-determination for Cyprus. Britain had the ruling mandate over the mostly ethnic Greek island, and wanted the Cyprus dispute to be resolved without being taken to the United Nations Security Council, where it could be problematically framed as an anti-colonialist struggle. To this end, Britain diplomatically encouraged Turkey to agitate Greece. The British ambassador to Greece also incited, saying in an August 1954 speech that Greco-Turkish ties were superficial, so nothing would be lost if, for example, something were to happen to Atatürk’s house in Thessaloniki. More bluntly, an official of the Foreign Office said that some agitation would be much to Turkey’s benefit. In any case, said parliamentarian John Strachey, Turkey had a large ethnic Greek minority in Istanbul as a card to play against Greece if it considered annexing an independent Cyprus to Greece.\nThe concerns about the events in Cyprus led to the formation of a number of nationalist student and irredentist organizations in İstanbul, such as the National Federation of Turkish Students (Turkish: Türkiye Milli Talebe Federasyonu), the National Union of Turkish Students, and Hikmet Bil’s (editor of the major newspaper Hürriyet) “Cyprus is Turkish” Association (Turkish: Kıbrıs Türktür Cemiyeti), who had protested against the Greek minority and the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\nIn 1955, a propaganda campaign involving the Turkish press galvanized public opinion against the Greek minority, targeting Athenogoras, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, in particular, accusing him of collecting donations for Enosis. Leading the pack was Hürriyet, which wrote on 28 August 1955: “If the Greeks dare touch our brethren, then there are plenty of Greeks in Istanbul to retaliate upon.” Ömer Sami Coşar from Cumhuriyet wrote on 30 August:\nNeither the Patriarchate nor the Rum minority ever openly supported Turkish national interests when Turkey and Athens clashed over certain issues. In return, the great Turkish nation never raised its voice about this. But do the Phanar Patriarchate and our Rum citizens in Istanbul have special missions assigned by Greece in its plans to annex Cyprus? While Greece was crushing Turks in Western Thrace and was appropriating their properties by force, our Rum Turkish citizens lived as free as we do, sometimes even more comfortably. We think that these Rums, who choose to remain silent in our struggle with Greece, are clever enough not to fall into the trap of four or five provocateurs.\nTercüman, Yeni Sabah, and Gece Postası followed suit. The “Cyprus is Turkish” Association (CTA) stepped up activities in the weeks leading up to the riots, increasing the number of branches from three in August to ten by the time the attacks took place. On September 4, Hikmet Bil ordered students at Taksim Square, the heart of the city, to burn Greek newspapers. The same day, Kamil Önal of the CTA—and the National Security Service—handed out to students twenty thousands banners emblazoned “Cyprus is Turkish”.\nThe intercommunal violence in Cyprus prompted Turkey to transmit a diplomatic note to United Kingdom. United Kingdom then invited Turkey and Greece to a conference in London, which started on August 26. The day before the Tripartite London Conference (29 August–7 September 1955) began, Prime Minister Menderes claimed that Greek Cypriots were planning a massacre of Turkish Cypriots. Seeing the opportunity to extricate Britain, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan advised the Turkish delegates that they should be stern. Foreign minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu paid heed to Macmillan and launched a harsh opening salvo, stating that Turkey would reconsider its commitment to the Treaty of Lausanne unless Greece reconsidered its position on Cyprus. The Greek delegates, surprised by harshness of the speech, blamed the British.\nDeflecting domestic attention to Cyprus was politically convenient for the Menderes government, which was suffering from an ailing economy. Although a minority, the Greek population played a prominent role in the city’s business life, making it a convenient scapegoat during the economic crisis in the mid-50s which saw Turkey’s economy contract (with an 11% GDP/capita decrease in 1954). The DP responded first with inflationary policies, then when that failed, with authoritarianism and populism.[13] DP’s policies also introduced rural-urban mobility, which exposed some of the rural population to the lifestyles of the urban minorities. The three chief destinations were the largest three cities: Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. Between 1945 and 1955, the population of Istanbul increased from 1 million to about 1.6 million. Many of these new residents found themselves in shantytowns (Turkish: gecekondus), and constituted a prime target for populist policies.\nFinally, the conference fell apart on 6 September, the first day the subject of Cyprus would be broached at the conference, when news broke of the bombing of the Turkish consulate (and birthplace of Atatürk) in Greece’s second-largest city, Thessaloniki.\nMain targets of the Istanbul riots.\nPlanning\nThe 1961 Yassıada Trial after 1960 coup d’état accused Menderes and Foreign Minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu of planning the riots. Though both of them rejected the claims, it is believed by scholars that Menderes assented to the organization of protests in İstanbul against the Greeks, but the extent of knowledge of Zorlu, who had been in London for the conference, is unclear. Interior minister Namık Gedik was also accused of involvement, though he was not tried as he committed suicide before the trials started. According to Zorlu’s lawyer at the Yassiada trial, a mob of 300,000 was marshaled in a radius of 40 miles (60 km) around the city for the attacks. The role of National Security Service was not clarified at the trials, since the sole aim of the junta was to sentence the DP government.\nThe trial revealed that the fuse for the consulate bomb was sent from Turkey to Thessaloniki on 3 September. During the Yassıada Trial it was claimed that a twenty-year-old university student named Oktay Engin was given the mission of installing the explosives, two sticks of gelignite, in the consulate’s garden.[24][26][27] The consul M. Ali Balin allegedly first pressured consulate employee Hasan Uçar, but Engin was brought in when Uçar resisted. Both of them were arrested after the attack.\nEngin was born in Komotini (Turkish: Gümülcine) to Faik Engin (a well-known parliamentarian in the late ’40s; he was one of the three Turkish members of the Greek parliament between 1946-1950) and became one of the few Turkish students to graduate from the Greek gymnasium in those years. Turkish officials encouraged him to study law, offering him a scholarship, so that he could promote the interests of Turkish citizens in Greece. He thus entered Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1953. When he was in his second year, he was accused of incitement in the bombing incident. Engin said that he had been followed by Greek intelligence agents so closely from the start of his university education, that he could name one (“Triondafilos”).\nIn his 2005 book, Speros Vryonis documents the direct role of the Demokrat Parti organization and government-controlled trade unions in amassing the rioters that swept Istanbul. Ten of Istanbul’s 18 branches of the “Cyprus is Turkish” Association were run by DP officials. This organization played a crucial role in inciting anti-Greek activities. Most of the rioters came from western Asia Minor. His case study of Eskişehir shows how the party there recruited 400 to 500 workers from local factories, who were carted by train with third class-tickets to Istanbul. These recruits were promised the equivalent of 6 USD, which was never paid. They were accompanied by Eskişehir police, who were charged with coordinating the destruction and looting once the contingent was broken up into groups of 20–30 men, and the leaders of the party branches.\nWhile the DP took the blame for the events, it was revealed in 2005 that the riots were in actuality a product of the Turkey’s Tactical Mobilization Group; a clandestine special forces unit. Four star general Sabri Yirmibeşoğlu, the right-hand man of General Kemal Yamak who led the Turkish outpost of Operation Gladio under the Tactical Mobilization Group (Turkish: Seferberlik Taktik Kurulu), proudly reminisced about his involvement in the riots, calling them “a magnificent organization”.\nBefore the 6 September, some of the buildings of the Greeks and other non-Muslim minorities are marked with cross signs in order to make the arson easier,\nExecution\nMunicipal and government trucks were placed in strategic points all around the city to distribute the tools of destruction (shovels, pickaxes, crowbars, ramrods and petrol), while 4,000 taxis were requisitioned from the Drivers Association and Motor Vehicle Workers’ Trade Union (Turkish: Şoförler Cemiyeti ve Motorlu Taşıt İşçileri Sendikası) to transport the perpetrators. In addition, flags had been prepared by the Textile Workers’ Union (Turkish: Tekstil İşçileri Sendikası).\nA protest rally on the night of 6 September, organised by the authorities in Istanbul, on the Cyprus issue and the bombing of Atatürk’s home was the cover for amassing the rioters. At 13:00, news reports of the bombing were announced by radio.[22] However, most people at the time did not have radios, so they had to wait until 16:30, when the daily İstanbul Ekspres, which was associated with the DP and the National Security Service (NSS), repeated the news in print.\nAccording to a September 2005 episode of the weekly show Files on the Greek Mega Channel, the accompanying photographs were seen by Salonican photographer Yannis Kyriakidis on September 4 (two days before the actual bombing). The consul’s wife had brought the film to the photo studio that belonged to Kyriakidis’ father to be printed. The photographs were then photomontaged, according to the program.\nOn the day of the event, the editor, Gökşin Sipahioğlu, called the owner, Mithat Perin, asking for permission for a second run. The weather was bad, so Perin declined thinking the prints would not get sold. The newspaper’s main dealer, Fuat Büke, soon called and offered to pay for the run in advance. By the time Perin went to inspect the Tan Press, 180,000 copies had already been printed. Sensing something fishy, Perin tore up the paper and stopped the run. The prototype was still intact however, and the workers secretly resumed printing after Perin left. They had eventually printed 300,000 copies (on paper stocked in advance), of which 296,000 were sold. This was far above the newspaper’s average circulation of 30,000–40,000 (by comparison, the best-selling Hürriyet sold 70–80 thousand copies). Perin was arrested the next day. Gökşin Sipahioğlu later alleged the NSS had pressured him to do it, while Perin says Sipahioğlu himself was an agent. Perin’s innocence, however, was cast into doubt after intrepid journalist Uğur Mumcu published an excerpt from a 1962 letter between Perin and the undersecretary of the NSS, Fuat Doğu, stating that in his 25 years of journalism, he had acted in full knowledge of the NSS and had not refrained from doing anything.\nAt 17:00, the riots started in Taksim Square, and rippled out during the evening through the old suburb of Beyoğlu (Pera), with smashing and looting of Greek commercial property, particularly along Yüksek Kaldırım street. By six o’clock at night, many of the Greek shops on Istanbul’s main shopping street, İstiklal Avenue, were ransacked.[22] Many commercial streets were littered with merchandise and fittings torn out of Greek-owned businesses. According to the eyewitness account of a Greek dentist, the mob chanted “Death to the Giaours” (non-Turks), “Massacre the Greek traitors”, “Down with Europe” and “Onward to Athens and Thessaloniki” as they attacked. Predictably, the situation came soon out of control and the mobs were shouting “First your property. Then your life”.\nThe riot died down by midnight with the intervention of the Turkish Army and declaration of martial law. The police, which supported the attacks by preparing and organizing the operations, was ordered to hold a passive stance and leave the mob to roam the streets of the city freely and commit atrocities against the civilian population. The Turkish militia and police that coordinated the attacks refrained from protecting the lives and properties of the victims. Their function was instead to preserve adjacent Turkish properties.[38] However, there were a few cases where police officers prevented criminal activity. On the other hand, the fire brigade, whenever it reached a fire, claimed that it was unable to deal with it.\nPersonal violence\nAccording to most sources, between 13 and 16 Greeks and one Armenian (including two clerics) died as a result of the pogrom. However, a number of deaths were never recorded due to the general chaos, so estimates vary. An early source gives the number of dead as 0, but later sources and witness accounts do not affirm this. According to a number of other sources the total death toll is estimated to be at least 30. Apart from the thirty identified victims, an additional of three unidentified bodies were found inside the shops, while three burned bodies were found in a sack in the region of Besiktas.[38] Moreover, 32 Greeks were severely wounded. Men and women were raped and islamized by force, and according to accounts including those of the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin, men, including a priest, were subjected to forced circumcision by members of the mob.[2] Moreover, an Armenian rite Christian priest died after the procedure.[citation needed] Priests were also scalped and burnt in their beds and Greek women raped. Nesin wrote:\nA man who was fearful of being beaten, lynched or cut into pieces would imply and try to prove that he was both a Turk and a Muslim. “Pull it out and let us see,” they would reply. The poor man would peel off his trousers and show his “Muslimness” and “Turkishness”: And what was the proof? That he had been circumcised. If the man was circumcised, he was saved. If not, he was doomed. Indeed, having lied, he could not be saved from a beating. For one of those aggressive young men would draw his knife and circumcise him in the middle of the street and amid the chaos. A difference of two or three centimetres does not justify such a commotion. That night, many men shouting and screaming were Islamized forcefully by the cruel knife. Among those circumcised there was also a priest.\nMaterial damage and cost\nThe material damage was considerable, with damage to 5317 properties, almost all Greek-owned. Among these were 4214 homes, 1004 businesses, 73 churches, 2 monasteries, 1 synagogue, and 26 schools.[5] Over 4,000 Greek-owned businesses, 110 hotels, 27 pharmacies, 23 schools, 21 factories, 73 Greek (and other Christian) churches and over a thousand Greek-owned homes were badly damaged or destroyed.[2][13] The American consulate estimates that 59% of the businesses were Greek-owned, 17% were Armenian-owned, 12% were Jewish-owned, 10% were Muslim-owned; while 80% of the homes were Greek-owned, 9% were Armenian-owned, 3% were Jewish-owned, and 5% were Muslim-owned.\nEstimates of the economic cost of the damage vary from Turkish government’s estimate of 69.5 million Turkish lira (equivalent to 24.8 million US$), the British diplomat estimates of 100 million GBP (about 200 million US$), the World Council of Churches’ estimate of 150 million USD, and the Greek government’s estimate of 500 million USD. The Turkish government paid 60 million Turkish lira of restitution to those who registered their losses.\nChurch property\nRepresentatives of the World Council of Churches investigating the vandalized sarcophaguses of the deceased Ecumenical Patriarchs, in the Patriarchal cemetery in Balıklı.\nIn addition to commercial targets, the mob clearly targeted property owned or administered by the Greek Orthodox Church. 73 churches and 23 schools were vandalized, burned or destroyed, as were 8 baptisteries [?] and 3 monasteries. This represented about 90 percent of the church property portfolio in the city. The ancient Byzantine church of Panagia in Belgradkapı was vandalised and burned down. The church at Yedikule was badly vandalised, as was the church of St. Constantine of Psammathos. At Zoodochos Pege church in Balıklı, the tombs of a number of ecumenical patriarchs were smashed open and desecrated. The abbot of the monastery, Bishop Gerasimos of Pamphilos, was severely beaten during the pogrom and died from his wounds some days later in Balıklı Hospital. In one church arson attack, Father Chrysanthos Mandas was burned alive. The Metropolitan of Liloupolis, Gennadios, was badly beaten and went mad.\nElsewhere in the city, the Greek cemetery of Şişli, as well as the cemetery of the Patriarchates in Balıklı were targeted. Crosses and statues were vandalized, while sepulchers and burial vaults were opened and the remains of the dead were removed and dispersed by the fanatic mobs. Moreover, at Balıklı cemetery, the sarcophaguses of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchs were desecrated.\nWitnesses\nAn eyewitness account was provided by journalist Noel Barber of the London Daily Mail on 14 September 1955:\nThe church of Yedikule was utterly smashed, and one priest was dragged from bed, the hair torn from his head and the beard literally torn from his chin. Another old Greek priest [Fr Mantas] in a house belonging to the church and who was too ill to be moved was left in bed, and the house was set on fire and he was burned alive. At the church of Yeniköy, a lovely spot on the edge of the Bosporus, a priest of 75 was taken out into the street, stripped of every stitch of clothing, tied behind a car and dragged through the streets. They tried to tear the hair of another priest, but failing that, they scalped him, as they did many others.\nOn the occasion of the pogrom’s 50th anniversary, a seventy-year-old Mehmet Ali Zeren said, “I was in the street that day and I remember very clearly…In a jewelry store, one guy had a hammer and he was breaking pearls one by one.”\nOne famous eyewitness was James Bond novelist Ian Fleming, who as an MI6 agent was present under the cover of the International Police Conference on 5 September (which he ditched in favour of covering the riots for The Sunday Times). Fleming’s account was published on 11 September, bearing the title “The Great Riot of Istanbul”. It has been said that Fleming may have been tipped off by Nâzim Kalkavan, the Istanbul station chief of the MI6, who appears in 1957’s From Russia, with Love as “Darko Kerim”. According to Fleming’s biographer, John Pearson, Kalkavan was rather like Kerim bey.\nA number of Turkish eyewitness accounts were published in 2008 by Ayşe Hür in an article that appeared in Taraf.\nResistance\nThere are accounts of protection offered to the minorities by their fellow citizens that were successful in fending off the mob. The most organized team rallied behind air force captain Reşat Mater. Mater happened to be off duty and visiting his home in Cevizli’s Muhasebeciler Street, which was right next to the rally point, İstanbul Caddesi. Mater first hid some of his neighbors in his house, then he took to the street with his gun and his uniform. The boys in the neighborhood joined him, bringing domestic implements as substitute weapons. The mob passed by after seeing the barricade. Mater later rose all the way to Commander of the Air Force, making him third in the military line of command. His son Tayfun, who witnessed the pogrom, maintains ties with those who survived and fled to Greece.\nSecondary action\nWhile the pogrom was predominantly an Istanbul affair, there were some outrages in other Turkish cities.[22] On the morning of 7 September 1955 In İzmir, a mob overran the İzmir National Park, where an international exhibition was taking place, and burned the Greek pavilion.[12] Moving next to the Church of Saint Fotini, built two years earlier to serve the needs of the NATO Regional Headquarters’ Greek officers, the mob destroyed it completely. The homes of the few Greek families and officers were then looted.\nDocumentation\nConsiderable contemporary documentation showing the extent of the destruction is provided by the photographs taken by Demetrios Kaloumenos, then official photographer of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Setting off just hours after the pogrom began, Kaloumenos set out with his camera to capture the damage and smuggled the film to Greece. Famous Turkish photojournalist of Armenian descent, Ara Güler, also took many photographs during the pogrom.\nReactions\nAfter the events, 3,151 people were immediately arrested, the number of arrested later rose to 5,104. On 7 September, the Menderes government closed the “Cyprus is Turkish” Association (CTA) and arrested its executives. 34 trade unions were dissolved. The Minister of Internal Affairs Namık Gedik resigned on 10 September.\nThe investigation initially focused on the “Cyprus is Turkish” Association. CTA detainee, and spy, named Kamil Önal had one of his CTA associates burn an intelligence report originating from the National Security Service (NSS) that was at the CTA office. In addition, a member from the Kızıltoprak branch, Serafim Sağlamel, was found to be carrying an address list of non-Muslim citizens. However, on September 12, the government blamed Turkish Communists for the pogrom, arresting 45 “card-carrying communists” (including Aziz Nesin, Kemal Tahir, and İlhan Berktay). This type of “false flag” anti-Communist propaganda was a staple of the Counter-Guerrilla. When opposition leader İsmet İnönü delivered a speech criticizing the government for rounding up innocent people instead of the actual perpetrators, the communists were released in December 1955. An angry Menderes said that İnönü would not be forgiven for his speech, pardoning the communists.\nOktay Engin and consulate employee Hasan Uçar were arrested on 18 September. Engin was first charged with executing the attack, but he presented an alibi so the charge was dropped to incitement. He was detained for nine months. Three months later, he escaped to Turkey before the Greek courts sentenced him to 3.5 years. In addition, Turkey refused Greece’s extradition request.\n87 CTA leaders were released in December 1955, while 17 were taken to court on 12 February 1956. The indictment initially blamed the CTA only for inciting some students to burn Greek newspapers in Taksim Square. In response to police chief Kemal Aygün’s question about the Cominform’s role in the affair, Şevki Mutlugil of the NSS cooked up a report, which concluded that the Comintern and Cominform had conspired to sabotage NATO. As proof, the prosecution submitted some brochures from the Communist Party of Turkey and a pair of letters from Nâzım Hikmet which called on the workers of Cyprus to stand against imperialism. To bolster the claims, the indictment claimed that NSS agent Kamil Önal had contacted the Comintern while on duty in Lebanon and defected, effectively exonerating the NSS.\nThe remaining prisoners were released on 12 January 1957 for lack of evidence, by order of the Istanbul First Penal Court (Turkish: İstanbul 1. Ceza Mahkemesi).\nThe chargé d’affaires at the British Embassy in Ankara, Michael Stewart, directly implicated Menderes’ Demokrat Parti in the execution of the attack. “There is fairly reliable evidence that local Demokrat Parti representatives were among the leaders of the rioting in various parts of Istanbul, notably in the Marmara islands, and it has been argued that only the Demokrat Parti had the political organisation in the country capable of demonstrations on the scale that occurred,” he reported, refusing to assign blame to the party as a whole or Menderes personally, however.[citation needed] The Foreign Office pointedly underscored the fact that British citizens were also victims of the attack.\nAlthough British ambassador to Ankara, Bowker, advised British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan that the United Kingdom should “court a sharp rebuff by admonishing Turkey”, only a note of distinctly mild disapproval was dispatched to Menderes. The context of the Cold War led Britain and the U.S. to absolve the Menderes government of direct political blame. The efforts of Greece to internationalize the human rights violations through international organizations such as the UN and NATO found little sympathy. British NATO representative Cheetham deemed it “undesirable” to probe the pogrom. U.S. representative Edwin M. Martin thought the effect on the alliance was exaggerated, and the French, Belgians and Norwegians urged the Greeks to “let bygones be bygones”.\nBy popular vote, the Cyprus issue was dropped from the U.N. agenda on 23 September 1955. Britain had successfully avoided a potential diplomatic embarrassment.\nAftermath\nGreek population in Istanbul and percentages of the city population (1844-1997). The Turkish policies, after 1923, led virtually to the elimination of the Greek community.\nThe compensation package allocated by the Turkish Assembly was only 60 million Turkish liras. While 12.7 million Turkish liras were given to churches for compensation out of 39 million Turkish liras claimed for damages, the rest of the 60 million Turkish liras was distributed among applicants.\nTensions continued, and in 1958–1959, Turkish nationalist students embarked on a campaign encouraging a boycott against all Greek businesses. The task was completed eight years later in 1964 when the Ankara government reneged on the 1930 Greco-Turkish Ankara Convention, which established the right of Greek établis (Greeks who were born and lived in Istanbul but held Greek citizenship) to live and work in Turkey. As a result of tensions over the Cyprus issue, Turkey prohibited all commercial dealings by Greeks holding a Greek passport resulting in the deportation from Turkey of around 40,000 ethnic Greeks. They were allowed to take with them only 20 kg of their belongings and cash of 22 dollars. Moreover, the property they left was confiscated by the Turkish state ten years later. As a result of these policies, the Greek community of Istanbul shrank from 80,000 (or 100,000 by some accounts) persons in 1955 to only 48,000 in 1965. Today, the Greek community numbers about 2,500, mostly older, Greeks.\nThe Georgian community in Istanbul was also affected. It is estimated that there were about 10,000 Catholic Georgian residents in Istanbul in 1955. Most of the Georgians emigrated to Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States following the pogrom. As of 1994, there were only about 200 Catholic Georgians and a handful of Jewish Georgian families left in Istanbul.\nAfter the military coup of 1960, Menderes and Zorlu were charged at the Yassiada Trial in 1960–61 with violating the constitution. The trial also made reference to the pogrom, for which they were blamed. The accused were denied fundamental rights regarding their defence, and they were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging.\nThe editor of the Istanbul Ekspres, Gökşin Sipahioğlu, went on to found Sipa Press; an international photo agency based in France. The owner, Mithat Perin, already a DP member, became a parliamentarian.\n2005 exhibition assault\nIn 2005, Turkish nationalists attacked a photography exhibition dedicated to the fiftieth anniversary of the 1955 riots held in İstanbul. The exhibition itself was initially heralded as a major step forward for the development of democratic values in preparation of Turkey’s admittance into the European Union. The military prosecutor at the time of the riots, vice admiral Fahri Çoker, kept documents and approximately 250 photographs of the events in order to educate posterity. He entrusted them to the Turkish Historical Society, stipulating that they be exhibited 25 years after his death.\nTwo hours prior the opening of the exhibition, a nationalist lawyer and former president of Ülkü Ocakları Ramazan Kirik, Kemal Kerinçsiz, inspected the gallery and angrily walked out.[60] Upon the opening of the exhibition, two people stood in front of the venue shouting and announcing that this exhibition was a misrepresentation of reality and that it wasn’t considerate towards the sufferings of the Turkish people.\nMoments later, a 20–30 militant nationalist mob that belonged to the Ülkücüler nationalist organization raided and defaced the exhibit by hurling eggs at the photographs and trampling over them. Some of the photographs were thrown outside windows only to be stamped upon by other raiders. The raiders also distributed pamphlets and flyers that said, “Turkey is Turkish, will remain Turkish,” “death to traitors,” “love it or leave it,” “Cyprus is Turkish and will remain Turkish,” “why not the pictures from Cyprus but these,” and “don’t defend those who set fire to Atatürk’s house.”\nThe raid was led by Kerinçsiz and nationalist lawyer Levent Temiz who have been taken into custody in 2008 for their suspected connection with Ergenekon. The assault was described by Feyyaz Yaman, the director of the gallery, as a repeat of the 1955 rioting in itself. The President of the Turkish Historical Society Orhan Silier condemned the attacks and stated that such acts of this event “will affect Turkey’s image abroad.” He also mentioned that “These protests show that groups based on the same violent methods, fear and paranoia, still exist.”\nThe incident was shown in Screamers, a 2006 documentary film about the Armenian Genocide.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_uk-population-set-to-surge-by-5-million-due-to-migration/content_554.html": "UK Population Set to Surge by 5 Million Due to Migration\nThe Office for National Statistics has released projections indicating that the UK’s population will reach 72.5 million by mid-2032, with the increase driven almost entirely by net migration. This significant demographic shift represents a continuation of recent trends, as the country’s population has already grown by more than 10 million over the past two decades.\nThe projected increase, averaging around 340,000 people annually, has sparked intense debate about the sustainability of current immigration policies. Critics argue that this level of population growth is placing unprecedented strain on public services and infrastructure, particularly affecting healthcare access and housing availability.\nDespite government promises to construct 1.5 million new homes, experts suggest this would be insufficient to accommodate even the next five years of population growth, let alone address existing housing shortages. GP services are experiencing particular pressure, with waiting times reportedly reaching unprecedented levels compared to previous generations.\nAnalysis of recent immigration patterns reveals that of the last 3 million people who entered the UK from outside the European Union under recent Conservative governments, only 22% are currently in employment. This statistic challenges the traditional economic argument for high levels of immigration, suggesting that the fiscal benefits may be less straightforward than previously assumed.\nHistorical context shows a dramatic shift in migration patterns. From the Windrush era until nearly the millennium, net migration averaged around 30,000 people annually. Current figures approach one million per year, representing a paradigm shift in the UK’s demographic composition.\nThe situation has highlighted tensions between economic needs and social infrastructure capacity. While some sectors argue for continued immigration to fill skills gaps, others point to the need to address domestic workforce participation, particularly regarding benefit dependency. The current system creates challenges for benefit recipients who wish to enter employment, as working more than 16 hours weekly can result in benefit losses that leave them financially worse off.\nThe debate extends to higher education, with universities playing a significant role in immigration figures. Recent developments, such as Cardiff University announcing 400 full-time job cuts, underscore the sector’s dependence on international students. Post-Brexit immigration patterns have shown significant changes, with new visa requirements affecting movement patterns.\nDemographics present additional complexities, with projections showing the number of over-85s will double to 3.3 million by 2047. This aging population raises questions about social care provision and the sustainability of pension commitments, including the triple lock system.\nThe discourse around population growth also touches on domestic demographics, with some experts highlighting the UK’s declining birth rate as a fundamental challenge. This demographic shift suggests that immigration levels are partially compensating for insufficient domestic population replacement, raising questions about long-term economic sustainability and the need for policies supporting family formation.\nThe situation remains fluid, with ongoing debates about potential solutions, including calls for improved vocational training, reforms to the benefits system, and more strategic approaches to managing migration levels while maintaining economic growth and public service quality.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-drive-towards-evs-is-threatening-the-economy/content_305.html": "The drive towards EVs is threatening the economy\nElectric Vehicle Manufacturing in the United Kingdom: A Sector Under Significant Strain\nThe British automotive industry is experiencing a pronounced downturn, with electric vehicle (EV) production facing unprecedented challenges that are sending shockwaves through the manufacturing sector. Recent data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reveals a stark decline in car production, highlighting the intense pressures confronting manufacturers during this critical transition period.\nProduction Decline and Market Dynamics\nIn October, overall car production plummeted by over 15% compared to the same period last year, primarily attributed to a substantial reduction in export volumes and weakening international demand. The most striking statistic is the one-third decline in electric and hybrid vehicle production, a figure that underscores the sector’s current volatility.\nThe challenges are not merely statistical but have tangible human and industrial consequences. Major automotive manufacturers are making difficult strategic decisions that are reshaping the landscape of UK manufacturing. Stellantis, the parent company of Vauxhall, has announced the closure of its Luton van-making factory, a move that puts 1,100 jobs at immediate risk. Similarly, Ford has declared plans to cut 800 jobs over the next three years, citing challenging trading conditions and diminished electric vehicle demand.\nIndustry Leadership Speaks Out\nMike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, has been unequivocal about the sector’s predicament. “These are deeply concerning times for the automotive industry,” he stated, emphasising the “massive investments in plants and new zero emission products” that are currently under intense scrutiny.\nThe global context is equally complex. While worldwide EV demand has experienced a slowdown, the UK faces unique challenges. Manufacturers are grappling with what Hawes describes as “the toughest targets and most accelerated timeline” without sufficient customer incentives to drive market adoption.\nRegulatory Landscape and Government Intervention\nThe UK’s Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandate represents a critical regulatory framework in this transition. From 2024, manufacturers are required to ensure that 22% of their car sales and 10% of van sales are zero-emission vehicles, with these targets set to increase progressively. Non-compliance carries significant financial penalties, including a £15,000 fine for each sale outside the mandate.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has acknowledged the industry’s concerns, promising a “fast track” consultation on how these EV targets will be enforced. Simultaneously, the government remains committed to the 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.\nThe Department for Business and Trade has emphasised its commitment, highlighting investments of £2 billion in car manufacturing and over £300 million to support electric vehicle uptake.\nPerspectives from Industry Insiders\nMark Noble, the former UK manufacturing lead for Stellantis, provided a candid assessment of the challenges. He pointed to multiple external factors impacting UK manufacturing, including Brexit-related uncertainties and tariff complexities that have particularly affected plants with high export ratios.\nCharging Infrastructure: A Critical Consideration\nThe transition to electric vehicles is not solely about manufacturing but also infrastructure. While some industry voices highlight charging infrastructure limitations, Vicky Read from Charge UK offers a more optimistic perspective, noting that a new charging point is being installed every 25 minutes.\nGovernment figures support this narrative, revealing over 71,000 public charge points across the United Kingdom, with an average of 57 being added daily.\nExpert Analysis and Future Outlook\nGovernment adviser James Richardson from the Climate Change Committee offers a forward-looking perspective. He warns that traditional automotive companies risk being overtaken by new competitors if they do not adapt quickly to the rapidly evolving market.\nThe electric vehicle sales targets, according to Richardson, are crucial in signalling the urgent need for manufacturers to innovate or risk market marginalisation.\nConclusion\nThe UK’s automotive sector stands at a critical juncture. The transition to electric vehicles presents both significant challenges and unprecedented opportunities. While the current landscape appears turbulent, with production declines and job uncertainties, the underlying commitment to sustainable transportation remains resolute.\nAs manufacturers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders continue to navigate this complex terrain, the coming months and years will be pivotal in determining the United Kingdom’s role in the global electric vehicle revolution.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_thirty-one-migrants-picked-up-in-kato-pyrgos/content_502.html": "The Cyprus mail reported: A group of 31 Syrian migrants were picked up near Kato Pyrgos late Monday. Despite the bad weather, their vessel had docked in occupied Limnitis from where the passengers were taken to Pyrgos. Among the Syrians on the boat were a family with two young children aged 5 and 6 and 27 men. The migrants were taken to the Polis Chrysochous police station. Later in the day they are expected to be taken to the reception centre at Kokkinothrimithia in Nicosia.\nOPINION\nHere we are repeating ourselves again, but I believe that many people do not realise the gravity of what is going on. Italy has turned on their immigrants, which is understandable considering they do nothing but make demands and show nothing but contempt for the countries that take them in. Most of these are now being dumped in Cyprus instead, the numbers have grown exponentially over the last year or two and here we are constantly saying what we think we should be seen to say.\nThe reality is, that they are being quietly dumped in Cyprus, they are coached on how to behave, what to do and what to say, so they can quietly slip under the radar until they are granted asylum and then they can move on to mainland Europe, where they are counted as ‘European migration’\nTHIS IS ALL PART OF AN AGENDA!\nThere are SIX BILLION people in the world, living in abject poverty, how many can we take? Every time we take one in, we encourage a hundred more to make their way here, but that does not matter to the left wing white shaming Snowflakes, who have nothing but contempt for everything that Europe stands for.\nWe SHOULD NOT take these people in, NONE OF THEM, migrations within Europe is one thing, but this is an invasion and it is not an accident.\nSadly this situation is actually being created and we should direct our attention to those who are causing this. Fortunately, our leaders here in Cyprus are not warmongers, they are just corrupt thieves!\nWe need to see through the narrative, Europe is under attack, we are under attack, along with everything we stand for. People need to stop saying what they think they should be seen to say, it’s time to call a spade a spade!",

Demetriou ultimately used the money to quit his job and to move his family into a listed £3,500-a-month Hertfordshire property, before purchasing expensive holidays, cars, and designer goods. One victim told The Sun: “We were told we would get our money back after he had sued the health authority and police.\n“But Demetriou was living it up on our money while pretending it was going to be used to win justice over his mum’s death.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-europe-is-failing-in-technology/content_317.html": "Why Europe is failing in technology\nThe Challenges Facing Europe in the Global Tech Race\nIntroduction\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of technology, Europe stands as a paradox. Home to some of the world’s most renowned scientific and technological minds, the continent has struggled to keep pace with the United States and Asia in the global tech arena. While Europe has a rich history of technological innovation, it has faced numerous challenges in recent years that have hindered its ability to produce tech giants capable of rivalling those in the United States and China. In this blog post, we will delve into the factors contributing to Europe’s lag in the tech industry and explore the potential solutions and opportunities that lie ahead.\n1. Market Capitalization Disparity\nOne striking indicator of Europe’s lag in the tech industry is the market capitalization of its top tech companies compared to those in the United States and China. The top tech giants in the United States and China boast staggering combined market capitalizations, while European tech companies fall significantly short. This discrepancy in market capitalization reflects the difference in the scale and impact of tech companies from these regions.\n2. Historical Turning Points\nHistorical turning points have contributed to Europe’s current position in the tech industry. The influx of European talent into the United States during the 20th century, the creation of Silicon Valley, and Asia’s focus on manufacturing and hardware development have all played a role in shaping the global tech landscape.\n3. Market Fragmentation\nThe diversity in languages, cultures, and regulatory frameworks across European countries has fostered innovation but has also hindered the development of a unified tech ecosystem. This fragmentation presents challenges for European tech startups seeking to expand across the continent, in contrast to the homogenous markets in the United States and China.\n4. Brain Drain\nThe Brain Drain phenomenon, where highly skilled European tech professionals migrate to regions like Silicon Valley in pursuit of better opportunities, poses a significant challenge to Europe’s tech industry. Retaining talent is crucial for cultivating a thriving tech ecosystem within Europe.\n5. Risk-Averse Culture\nEurope’s risk-averse culture, coupled with a preference for traditional career paths, has resulted in fewer investment opportunities for tech startups. This cultural divide has limited the growth of Europe’s startup culture, making it challenging for companies to secure the necessary funding for innovation and expansion.\n6. Regulatory Challenges\nStringent data protection laws and complex regulatory environments in Europe, such as GDPR, can create barriers to entry and increase compliance costs for tech companies. Tax regulations, including digital services taxes, have also impacted the growth of tech companies in the region.\nConclusion\nEurope’s challenges in the global tech race are multifaceted and complex, spanning market fragmentation, talent retention, cultural factors, and regulatory hurdles. However, despite these challenges, there is hope on the horizon. Initiatives like the European Commission’s Digital Single Market strategy and the European Innovation Council (EIC) are working to remove barriers and provide support for tech innovation in Europe.\nSuccess stories like Spotify and Adyen demonstrate that Europe has the potential to compete on a global scale. By addressing these challenges head-on, Europe can unlock its potential for growth and innovation in the tech industry. The future of Europe’s tech sector is not entirely bleak, but it will require concerted efforts to bridge the gap with the United States and Asia and secure its place in the global tech arena. Europe must rise to the occasion, for the tech race shows no signs of slowing down.",

This move comes amid concerns that Rishi Sunak’s controversial Rwanda plan is rerouting asylum seekers from Britain to Ireland.\nThe Taoiseach’s Request and Rationale\nThe Taoiseach, Simon Harris, has requested the Justice Minister, Helen McEntee, to bring proposals to the cabinet next week. These proposals would allow the return of inadmissible international protection applicants to the UK. This decision follows a claim by Sunak that the Conservative party’s deterrence policy is working and the revelation that 80% of recent asylum seekers to Ireland arrived via the land border with Northern Ireland.\nA spokesperson for Harris emphasised the need to protect the integrity of Ireland’s migration system, stating, “Ireland has a rules-based system that must always be applied firmly and fairly. This is one of a number of measures we are taking to strengthen our system and ensure that it is strong, effective and agile. Rules and the integrity of our migration system will be to the fore of our actions.”\nStrengthening Border Controls and Collaboration with UK\nMcEntee has pledged to reinforce Ireland’s border controls and discuss the return of refugees with James Cleverly and other British officials during her visit to London. “That’s why I’m introducing fast processing, that’s why I’ll have emergency legislation at cabinet this week to make sure that we can effectively return people to the UK, and that’s why I’ll be meeting with the home secretary to raise these issues on Monday,” she told RTÉ.\nPrevious Designation of UK as ‘Safe Third Country’\nIreland had previously designated the UK a “safe third country” to which asylum seekers could be returned. However, last month, the Irish High Court ruled that this practice breached EU law, impeding further returns.\nSunak’s Claim of Deterrence Impact\nIn an interview with Sky News on Sunday, Sunak claimed that the Rwanda legislation, signed into law last week, was already having an impact, as people were worried about coming to the UK. “Illegal migration is a global challenge, which is why you’re seeing multiple countries talk about doing third-country partnerships, looking at novel ways to solve this problem, and I believe will follow where the UK has led,” he said.\nRising Tensions and Anti-Immigrant Sentiment\nIreland’s refugee crisis has fuelled tensions and anti-immigrant sentiment across the country. Last week, a protest in County Wicklow over proposed refugee accommodation led to violent clashes with police, who used shields, sprays, and arrested six people. Police reported that rocks and other missiles were thrown, and they recovered an axe from the scene.\nIn recent years, there have been protests and arson attacks on proposed refugee accommodation centres around Ireland, raising anxiety over far-right agitation and threats against politicians.\nTaoiseach’s Warning on Abuse of Public Figures\nIn a speech to be delivered later on Sunday, the Taoiseach warned about the dangers of abuse towards public figures. “We know how this story ends,” Harris will say. “We have had too many warnings, and we need to take them seriously before the unthinkable happens.”\nInflux of Refugees and Housing Crisis\nIreland has taken in more than 100,000 refugees, about three-quarters from Ukraine. However, the country is facing an acute housing crisis that has driven up rents and homelessness, further fuelling anti-immigrant sentiment. In November, a riot wrecked parts of central Dublin, highlighting the escalating tensions surrounding the refugee crisis.\nBalancing Humanitarian Obligations and Domestic Concerns\nAs Ireland grapples with the influx of refugees and the strain on its resources, the government faces the challenge of balancing its humanitarian obligations with domestic concerns over housing, social cohesion, and public sentiment. The proposed emergency measures to return asylum seekers to the UK reflect the administration’s efforts to address these pressing issues and maintain the integrity of the country’s migration system.",

The youth mobility scheme would allow Europeans aged 18 to 30 to come to Britain for up to four years to work, travel, and study. This could pave the way for thousands of European workers, such as waiters, baristas, and au pairs, to fill gaps in the British workforce.\nUnder this reciprocal deal, proposed by the European Commission on Thursday, British citizens would also be able to move to the European continent for the same purposes.\nRebuilding Bridges Across the Channel\nMaros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, stated, “The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union has hit young people in the EU and the UK who would like to study, work and live abroad particularly hard. Today, we take the first step towards an ambitious but realistic agreement between the EU and the UK that would fix this issue. Our aim is to rebuild human bridges between young Europeans on both sides of the Channel.”\nAppeal to Labour’s Stance\nThe offer is likely to appeal to Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, who has signalled that he would seek closer ties with the EU if his party wins the upcoming general election.\nExisting Youth Mobility Schemes\nThe Home Office has already engaged in discussions with some EU countries after being asked by Rishi Sunak’s Downing Street to agree on more youth mobility schemes. The UK currently has reciprocal schemes with ten non-EU countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and Iceland.\nThese schemes allow eligible individuals to travel and work in Britain without needing a sponsor or meeting other requirements, such as salary thresholds, without significantly contributing to net migration.\nEU’s First Youth Mobility Treaty with a Third Country\nThe European Commission stated that it is making the offer of an EU-wide deal because the UK had already spoken with several member states to discuss youth mobility. If a deal is reached, it would be Brussels’ first youth mobility treaty with a third country.\nUnder the bloc’s offer, Britain would have to agree to equal treatment on tuition and visa fees, as well as healthcare surcharges.\nSafeguards and Limitations\nIn an online Q&A regarding its proposals, the EU made it clear that the scheme would not replace existing paths to obtaining visas and that either side would have the ability to reject applications due to threats to public security and health.\nPotential Stumbling Blocks\nIt is unlikely that negotiations will commence immediately, as the EU’s 27 member states are still required to agree on the Commission’s proposal. The forthcoming European Parliament elections and the general election in the UK are also likely to act as stumbling blocks to the talks beginning.\nCalls from Industry Leaders and Remain Campaigners\nIndustry leaders and Remain campaigners have been pushing for an EU-wide visa scheme to make it easier for young Britons to travel and work in the bloc, and vice-versa.\nNaomi Smith, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said, “This landmark intervention is a welcome acknowledgement of the immense impact that Brexit has had, not only on young Brits but young Europeans as well. The UK Government must now respond in kind. Until a reciprocal EU-UK youth mobility scheme is formalised, our young people will continue to be robbed of the irreplaceable formative experiences their parents and older siblings enjoyed, because of a failed Brexit project they did not vote for.”\nCharles Owen, of Seasonal Business in Travel, stated, “A reciprocal youth mobility scheme is a win-win for both Europe and the UK, and in particular for struggling businesses suffering from chronic labour shortages, made worse by Brexit. Momentum is building to get this deal done and we implore the prime minister to talk to Industry and prepare for the upcoming negotiations appropriately. This is a serious economic and cultural opportunity for all.”\nLabour’s Stance on the Proposal\nA Labour spokesperson responded to the EU’s proposal, saying, “This is a proposal from the EU Commission to EU member states, not to the UK. It has come about because the UK government is reportedly approaching other European countries to try to establish mobility arrangements.\n“Labour has no plans for a youth mobility scheme. We have already suggested some tangible ways that we would look to improve the relationship and deliver for British businesses and consumers, including seeking a veterinary agreement to tackle trade barriers, mutual recognition of professional qualifications, and improved touring opportunities for artists.\n“A Labour Government would seek to improve the UK’s working relationship with the EU within our red lines – no return to the single market, customs union, or free movement.”\nComment\nWho are they kidding? We now openly know, what we have known privately for a long time, the EU needs us more than we need it, that is official and they have admitted it.\nSo what is this motive behind this offer?\nFirstly the EU is in deep trouble both economically and socially. It has slipped from being 22% of global trade in 2017, to less than 15% last year, with expectations that it will sink to below 10% by the end of the decade. Brexit has been catastrophic for the EU and they are doing their best to sneak us back in, and if we are unfortunate enough to have a Labour government, this deceitful agenda will gain momentum. They do not care about the referendum, the will of the people or what is best for the UK, they care about the egotistical ambitions to be meddling in people’s lives at a higher level, with a bigger salary, it’s quite disgraceful really.\nIn the immediate future, this offer may seem like a wonderful gesture, with many Gen Z loving the idea of being free to endlessly wander around Europe, but in reality that does not happen anyway, this offer serves several purposes.\n- Where there is free movement, the years leading up to Brexit confirm that many more young people from the EU move here, rather than the other way round, and with the EU’s economy in crisis, this would be a very sneaky way for them to dump their youth unemployment on the UK.\n- This will be the thin end of the wedge, if we were to agree to this, it would only be a matter of time before the age limit were increased, taking us back to square one.\n- Immigrants who have been granted citizenship in the EU, who are mainly under 30s, would be free to move here.\nWho are they kidding?\nWe have not even executed Brexit yet, we need strong leadership, a clear agenda and better future for the UK away from this failed experiment, the EU in its current form is on borrowed time and they know it!",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_whistleblower-condemns-sir-keir-starmers-role-in-historical-grooming-cases/content_447.html": "Whistleblower Condemns Sir Keir Starmer’s Role in Historical Grooming Cases\nFormer Detective Inspector Criticises Labour Leader’s Past Leadership of Crown Prosecution Service\nA leading whistleblower has delivered a scathing assessment of Sir Keir Starmer’s involvement in addressing organised sexual exploitation, suggesting the current Prime Minister bears significant responsibility for systematic failures in prosecuting perpetrators.\nMaggie Oliver, the respected former Greater Manchester Police (GMP) detective who proved instrumental in exposing the devastating scale of abuse in Rochdale, has expressed profound scepticism regarding the Prime Minister’s commitment to uncovering the full extent of historical wrongdoing. She maintains that the time has come for comprehensive accountability from all parties involved in these institutional shortcomings.\nHistorical Context and Timeline:\nThe grooming gang scandals first came to widespread public attention in the early 2000s, with major cases emerging in several metropolitan areas across England. The Rochdale case, which Oliver helped expose, revealed systematic abuse between 2008 and 2010, though victims reported incidents dating back to 2004. Similar patterns emerged in Rotherham, where investigations uncovered abuse cases spanning from 1997 to 2013, affecting an estimated 1,400 children.\nPolitical Landscape:\nThe Labour Party’s recent opposition to establishing a comprehensive national public inquiry has sparked considerable controversy. The proposed investigation would examine the widespread sexual exploitation of vulnerable young women by predominantly British Pakistani gangs. This resistance has drawn criticism from various quarters, including international observers and victims’ advocates.\nInstitutional Failures:\nPrevious investigations have highlighted multiple institutional breakdowns across several regions:\n– Police forces repeatedly failed to act on victims’ reports\n– Local authorities overlooked clear warning signs\n– Social services often dismissed victims’ accounts\n– The Crown Prosecution Service frequently declined to pursue cases\n– Cultural sensitivities were prioritised over safeguarding responsibilities\nDuring Sir Keir’s tenure as Director of Public Prosecutions (2008-2013), numerous cases were either dropped or not pursued, despite what many argue was compelling evidence. He has subsequently acknowledged these failings, particularly regarding a notable case where substantial evidence against a rape suspect was deemed insufficient for prosecution.\nInternational Attention:\nThe controversy has attracted significant international attention, with prominent American figures including Elon Musk and Bill Ackman vocally criticising the UK’s handling of these cases. Ackman, a prominent hedge fund manager, has gone so far as to suggest international sanctions against Britain until the matter is adequately addressed.\nVictim Testimony:\nThe case of “Girl A” exemplifies the systematic failures. Despite providing police with DNA evidence and identifying her attackers in 2008, prosecutors initially dismissed her case, claiming she lacked credibility as a witness. It took two years and a case review before successful prosecutions were finally achieved, leading to a formal apology from the CPS.\nCurrent Developments:\nThe father of one Rochdale victim has joined growing calls for a national inquiry into what he terms “Britain’s untouchable grooming gangs.” He argues that contemporary cases continue to be overlooked due to misplaced concerns about social cohesion, suggesting that similar exploitation likely persists in major urban centres including Bradford, Leeds, London, and Birmingham.\nGovernment Response:\nThe current administration, through Health Secretary Wes Streeting, has pledged to implement recommendations from previous abuse inquiries fully. However, critics, including Oliver, argue that past investigations have consistently failed to deliver meaningful change or accountability.\nExpert Analysis:\nNazir Afzal, former chief crown prosecutor for the North West who successfully prosecuted numerous perpetrators, has expressed reservations about a new national inquiry. He suggests that implementing existing recommendations should take priority over launching fresh investigations.\nLooking Forward:\nThe debate continues over whether a new national inquiry would provide fresh insights or merely delay necessary reforms. However, there is growing consensus that whatever approach is taken must address both historical failings and current safeguarding challenges while ensuring genuine accountability for those who failed to protect vulnerable individuals.\nThis expanded version provides a more comprehensive examination of the issue while maintaining the core narrative and British English conventions. It incorporates additional historical context, expert perspectives, and analysis of both past failures and current challenges in addressing organised sexual exploitation in Britain.\nSummary Conclusion\nThe grooming gang scandals represent one of Britain’s most significant safeguarding failures, with repercussions continuing to influence current political discourse and child protection policies. The key points emerging from this analysis are:\n* Institutional accountability remains largely unfulfilled, with former detective Maggie Oliver highlighting how senior officials, including those at the Crown Prosecution Service under Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership, have yet to face meaningful consequences for their past decisions and oversights.\n* Cultural sensitivities and fears of being labelled racist or Islamophobic significantly hampered investigations and prosecutions, leading to thousands of vulnerable young people being failed by the very systems meant to protect them. This uncomfortable truth continues to influence contemporary discussions about safeguarding.\n* The resistance to a national public inquiry suggests ongoing tensions between political expediency and the need for transparency. Labour’s opposition to such an investigation, particularly given Sir Keir Starmer’s role as former DPP, raises questions about institutional willingness to confront past failures.\n* International scrutiny, particularly from prominent American figures like Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, has added a new dimension to the controversy, potentially influencing how Britain addresses these historical injustices and prevents future exploitation.\n* Victims and their families consistently report that similar exploitation patterns may still be occurring in major urban centres, suggesting that despite increased awareness, the fundamental issues enabling such abuse might not have been adequately addressed.\n* The debate over whether to launch a new national inquiry versus implementing existing recommendations highlights a broader challenge: balancing the need for historical accountability with the urgency of protecting vulnerable individuals today.\nThese findings underscore the complex interplay between political leadership, institutional responsibility, and the paramount importance of protecting vulnerable members of society, regardless of cultural or political sensitivities. In this regard, our leaders are guilty of a significant failure, this blatant cover-up and subsequent pandering the constant allegations of racism or Islamophobia have been exploited to allow these monsters to escape justice.\nWe must not stand for this behaviour, no matter who the perpetrators are, they must be brought to justice, and in parallel, all those who have facilitated these paedophiles escaping justice should also be punished. There is no doubt that we have a leadership in place that is unfit for the job, legally, ethically and morally.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-eu-has-its-eyes-on-irish-tax-revenue/content_585.html": "The EU has its eyes on Irish tax revenue\nIs the EU about to attempt to plunder Ireland’s tax revenues? Over the last decade or two, Ireland has done incredibly well, transitioning from where they were to where they are now. It serves as a model of enterprise and initiative. They were very wise to introduce a very low corporate tax rate of 12.5% for offshore companies, which attracted some of the largest companies in the world to base themselves in Ireland, bringing the country much-needed tax revenue merely for hosting them without providing anything in return.\nHowever, there is always a price for everything. When large offshore corporations establish a substantial presence in a small population and overall economy, it can distort the figures. If you were to look up Ireland’s GDP figures, they appear incredible, and the GDP per capita is one of the highest globally, with exceptions like Monaco and similar places. But all is not as it seems. As the saying goes, there are “lies, damn lies, and statistics,” and there is no greater fiscal lie than GDP.\nWithin GDP figures, government borrowing used for investment in a country is included. In Ireland’s case, where offshore corporations operate, their turnover is included in Ireland’s GDP. When divided up to calculate GDP per capita, it may seem like the average citizen of the Republic of Ireland enjoys a lifestyle similar to that of a citizen of Kuwait. However, this is far from the truth.\nThese offshore corporations have skewed the figures and created a bubble within the economy. They function as separate entities, having their own team of skilled workers that they bring in, impacting local housing. Many may recall the scenes of long queues for rental properties in Dublin a few months ago. Life for the average citizen has become even more challenging due to these distortions.\nNow, it may become even harder as the EU is showing interest in Ireland’s tax revenue. Despite the narrative, the EU is struggling to fund itself, exacerbated since the departure of the UK. They miss the UK’s contribution, and their relative position on the world stage is diminishing rapidly. In 2018, with the UK, the EU represented 22% of global GDP. Without the UK, it dropped to 16.5%, and this year it has fallen to around 15%, with Germany facing recession, which may push it below 15%. They are on course to represent no more than 10% of global GDP by the end of the decade. Hence, the EU is looking to expand and potentially exploit the wealth of other countries directly or indirectly.\nRegarding Ireland, the EU is pressuring the country to increase its corporate tax rate to 15%, an internationally agreed figure to prevent any country from having an unfair advantage. However, the speaker suggests that rules are often created to maintain an advantageous position and prevent others from changing the odds.\nThe speaker believes that Ireland should have the autonomy to decide its own tax rates for offshore companies. These decisions should be made internally by the government of the Republic of Ireland, without interference from the EU or the IMF. Another threat looming is the EU considering imposing a 0.5% levy on revenue from offshore companies in Ireland, which the speaker views as little more than theft.\nIn conclusion, the speaker hopes that Ireland can continue its progress without external interference. They believe that Ireland has come a long way, but there is still work to be done to ensure that everyday citizens benefit from the economic growth and are not left behind. The speaker also expresses dissatisfaction with the EU’s actions and decisions, emphasizing the importance of national sovereignty.\nAs for the UK, the speaker sees it as evidence supporting the decision to leave the EU and believes that they should have done so more abruptly, without allowing external influences to undermine their economy.",

The decision was based on multiple reservations about the visit. This move from Tunis comes nearly two months after the EU signed a memorandum of understanding with Tunisia to curb irregular migration. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the details of this development and discuss the broader issues surrounding European migration policies.\nTunisia’s Stance\nTunisia’s decision to deny entry to the European parliamentary delegation has raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about the state of migration and cooperation between the EU and North African countries. To shed light on this issue, Kami Lookers, the associate director at the Migration Policy Institute, shared insights during an interview on France 24.\nMigration Surge to Lampedusa\nOne of the critical issues discussed during the interview was the significant uptick in arrivals on the Italian island of Lampedusa in the past two days, with approximately seven thousand people making the dangerous journey. Lookers pointed out that this surge can be attributed to a mix of factors.\nFirstly, deteriorating conditions in Tunisia have prompted a series of boat departures, as individuals seek better opportunities and safety. The racist rhetoric of the Tunisian president over the past year has added to the challenges faced by migrants, especially those from sub-Saharan Africa.\nSecondly, many people are leaving their countries due to a variety of reasons, including social and economic conditions, civil conflicts, and civil wars, such as the case of Burkina Faso. Climate change is also playing a role in displacing people, further contributing to the migration crisis.\nEffectiveness of EU-Tunisia Agreements\nThe conversation then shifted to the effectiveness of agreements between the EU and countries like Tunisia in curbing irregular migration. Lookers acknowledged that these agreements can work in the short term if the primary goal is to decrease arrivals. However, recent events have shown that such agreements can have limitations.\nThe agreement negotiated in July with Tunisia was designed to provide financial support to the country in exchange for enhanced border control and reduced departures from its shores. The recent surge in arrivals on Lampedusa indicates that the agreement’s effectiveness is questionable. Moreover, there are concerns that the EU is prioritizing short-term goals of reducing arrivals over supporting Tunisia as a stable democracy and advocating for migrant rights within the country.\nEU’s Approach: Combating Trafficking vs. Encouraging Legal Migration\nAnother significant aspect discussed in the interview was the EU’s approach to migration policies. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently emphasized the need to combat trafficking networks as a strategy to stop illegal migration. However, the interview raised a critical question: Is enough attention being given to encouraging legal migration?\nLookers pointed out that the EU has been struggling to reach a consensus among its member states regarding the reform of a common European asylum system. As a result, the focus has often shifted towards partnering with countries of origin to address the root causes of migration.\nWhile this approach has some merit, it takes time to yield results, and as conditions improve in source countries, people may still aspire to seek better opportunities in Europe. To address the issue effectively, there must be a balance between discouraging irregular migration and creating legal pathways for migrants to come to Europe.\nConclusion\nThe ongoing challenges and controversies surrounding European migration policies highlight the complex nature of the issue. While agreements with countries like Tunisia may offer short-term solutions, they do not address the root causes of migration. Additionally, the EU’s struggle to unite its member states on migration policies and the need to balance combating irregular migration with promoting legal pathways for migrants remain significant challenges.\nThe recent developments in Tunisia and the surge in arrivals on Lampedusa underscore the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to migration in Europe. Achieving this will require not only political will but also a commitment to long-term solutions that prioritize the rights and well-being of migrants and the stability of the countries involved.",

The legislation, officially termed a ‘workers rights charter’, could potentially restrict conversations in pubs if they’re deemed offensive to staff members.\nAccording to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the proposed legislation, set to take effect next year, might significantly impact freedom of expression and could even apply to overheard conversations. Under the new rules, pub conversations could be classified as harassment if they constitute “unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating a recipient’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.”\nThe legislation has drawn particular attention for its focus on discussions involving protected characteristics, such as gender, which could face increased scrutiny. Critics argue this could lead to situations where long-standing patrons face ejection from their local establishments over innocuous comments or traditional pub banter.\nThe timing of this legislation comes during a particularly challenging period for British pubs, with statistics showing that more than 400 pubs closed last year, averaging 34 closures per month. Critics suggest that adding more regulatory burden could further accelerate this decline.\nThe proposal has sparked a broader debate about Labour’s priorities and approach to workplace regulation. Some political commentators argue that the party should focus more on job creation and economic growth rather than introducing additional workplace restrictions. There are concerns that the legislation could make employment less attractive for businesses, potentially leading to situations similar to those seen in France, where complex employment laws have sometimes resulted in extended internship periods rather than proper employment contracts.\nCritics of the legislation point out potential practical challenges in implementation. The subjective nature of what constitutes offensive speech could lead to inconsistent enforcement. Contemporary discussions about current affairs, including international conflicts or domestic policy issues, could potentially fall foul of the new rules if staff members find them offensive.\nDefenders of the proposal argue that there needs to be a balance between free expression and protecting workers from genuine harassment. They suggest that the legislation isn’t aimed at stopping reasonable pub conversation but rather at preventing extreme cases where offensive language or behaviour creates an hostile environment for staff.\nThe debate touches on broader themes of British culture, with pubs traditionally serving as informal community forums where people can freely discuss current affairs and societal issues. Some view the legislation as a threat to this cultural institution, while others see it as a necessary modernisation of workplace protections.\nThere are also concerns about the potential legal implications for pub owners. Under the proposed rules, staff members could potentially take legal action against their employers over conversations they overhear, which critics argue could force some establishments to close rather than risk such liability.\nThe proposal has drawn comparisons to other controversial speech-related legislation, including attempts in Scotland to regulate speech within private homes. This has led to broader discussions about the balance between protecting individuals from harassment and maintaining fundamental freedoms of expression.\nThe timing of this legislation has also raised questions about Labour’s connection with its traditional working-class base, with some suggesting that such regulations represent a disconnect between the party’s current policies and its historical roots in working-class communities.\nAs the debate continues, questions remain about how such legislation would be practically implemented in the dynamic environment of a typical British pub, where conversations naturally flow and the line between acceptable banter and offensive speech can often be subjective. The coming months are likely to see continued discussion about this significant potential change to Britain’s pub culture and workplace regulations.\nSummary\n* Labour’s proposed ‘workers rights charter’ could restrict pub conversations if staff members find them offensive, particularly regarding topics involving protected characteristics like gender or discussions that might create a “hostile environment.”\n* The Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned that the law, planned for next year, could limit freedom of expression and would apply to overheard conversations in pubs, not just direct interactions with staff.\n* The timing is particularly concerning as the pub industry is already struggling, with over 400 pubs closing last year (averaging 34 closures monthly). Critics argue this additional regulation could accelerate pub closures.\n* There are practical concerns about implementation, since determining what constitutes offensive speech is highly subjective and could lead to inconsistent enforcement across different establishments.\n* The legislation has sparked debate about Labour’s priorities, with critics arguing the party should focus more on job creation and economic growth rather than introducing additional workplace restrictions.\n* Pub owners could face legal liability if staff members take action over conversations they overhear, potentially creating an unsustainable business environment.\n* Critics view this as a threat to British pub culture, where pubs have traditionally served as informal community forums for open discussion of current affairs and societal issues.\n* The proposal has drawn comparisons to other controversial speech-related legislation, including attempts in Scotland to regulate speech within private homes.\n* Defenders argue the legislation aims to protect workers from genuine harassment rather than stop reasonable pub conversation, though critics question how this distinction would be made in practice.\n* The debate highlights a perceived disconnect between Labour’s current policies and its historical connection to working-class communities and traditions.",

The minister announced the release of three more video clips on animal welfare that aim to raise awareness about micro-chipping dogs, adopting shelter dogs, and neutering and spaying cats.\nIn one video clip a boy loses his dog, which ends up in a shelter because it didn’t have a microchip. Another video clip stresses the importance of adopting dogs from shelters and the third one, aiming to raise awareness on cat neutering and spaying, shows a couple abandoning kittens born by their cat in a field.\n“It is imperative to change the way many people treat animals. Such information campaigns contribute in this direction,” Kadis said.\nHe said an effort is underway in cooperation with the Game and Wildlife Fund and the Cyprus Hunters’ Federation for the obligatory registration of hunting dogs, including their microchipping, during the procedure of issuing hunting permits.\n“This measure is expected to contribute substantially to the reduction of stray dogs as well as to the phenomenon of dog theft.”\nAt the same time, he said, the agriculture ministry has developed a single database in which veterinarians have to add the microchip number of each animal as they install it. Kadis said his ministry is currently in consultations in the Veterinary Association to implement a dog micro-chipping programme at a very low price to offer an incentive to owners to microchip their dogs and gradually reduce the problem of strays.\nA cat neutering and spaying programme has been successfully implemented for the second consecutive year in collaboration with animal welfare organisations, he said, adding that this programme is improving year after year and that his ministry intends to continue it. He also referred to the government bill aimed at amending the law on dogs, which, he said, introduces new provisions for better living conditions of dogs. Among other things, the bill forbids keeping dogs permanently tied to a chain and keeping them on roofs and balconies.\n“An important provision of this law is that there are incentives to neuter and spay dogs and reduce their uncontrolled breeding. At the same time, harsh fines are being introduced on pollution and nuisance,” he said.\nA public consultation is currently underway on the bill.\nThe minister also said that state funding to animal welfare organisations has been doubled and that he would table to cabinet within the coming days a proposal on further supporting organisations that also have animal shelters to meet the conditions of the new law.\nCOMMENT\nAlthough an increasing number of people in Cyprus have begun to care about animals, generally, they are not treated well. There is a big problem with stray Cats, that roam the streets in huge numbers, although many do find regular sources of food, many do not. The problem with this is that lost of them are actually rounded up and mistreated, dumped or attacked. There is also an issue with Dogs, many people take on a Dog to use for hunting, but when they have finished with it, they dump it, or mistreat it. The majority of people in Cyprus keep Dogs tied up day and night and rarely take them for a walk.\nThere is an urgent need for people to learn to respect animals and an even greater need for those who abuse them to be prosecuted.",

However, it seems that some Albanians have found a way to free themselves from these digital constraints, sparking discussions around immigration policy and enforcement measures.\nThe TikTok videos depict individuals deftly removing their ankle tags using nothing more than kitchen scissors. Their apparent success in this endeavor has generated both fascination and concern, as they tout this method as a means to abscond without fear of legal repercussions. The ease with which they remove the tags and evade authorities raises questions about the effectiveness of such monitoring devices.\nAnkle Tags: The “British Rolexes”\nThe moniker “British Rolexes” is an ironic twist on the fact that these ankle tags are often seen as an attempt to enforce stringent control over individuals, much like the prestige associated with a luxury watch. These tags, however, are not symbols of affluence; instead, they symbolize a contentious aspect of immigration and criminal justice policy.\nEscaping Constraints: The TikTok Phenomenon\nThe TikTok videos showcase individuals nonchalantly severing their ankle tags, revealing a potentially critical loophole in the system. The tag-removers even humorously respond to questions like “Where are the police?” with quips like “In the police station, lol. I took it off myself.” These seemingly fearless acts suggest that some individuals are willing to face jail time or other penalties just to elude the clutches of immigration enforcement.\nOne commenter inquires about the effectiveness of cutting off the tag and changing addresses, to which a reply advises against returning home after the deed is done. Another video showcases an individual boasting about scamming an older-style tag, which only confirms an individual’s presence at home, unlike a GPS tag that tracks movements 24/7. Their brazenness and apparent success are sparking conversations about the role and limitations of technology in immigration control.\nPolicy Implications: A Balancing Act\nThe proliferation of these videos comes at a time when discussions around immigration policies and enforcement mechanisms are at the forefront of political discourse. Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, has hinted at the potential expansion of electronic ankle tag usage as part of a broader strategy to detain and deport those who arrive in the UK illegally.\nWith the surge in migrants arriving via small boats across the Channel, the UK government is grappling with the need for effective detention measures. A shortage of detention places and the evolving dynamics of immigration necessitate a reevaluation of the existing system.\nThe Challenge Ahead: Balancing Technology and Human Ingenuity\nAs discussions unfold about how to enhance the effectiveness of ankle tags and immigration enforcement, the Albanian migrants’ TikTok videos highlight a crucial aspect of the equation: the indomitable spirit of human ingenuity. The videos serve as a reminder that no matter how advanced technology becomes, individuals can find ways to outwit it. This underscores the importance of considering a comprehensive approach that blends technology with measures that minimize potential loopholes.\nThe intersection of immigration policy, technology, and human determination is complex. It remains to be seen how governments worldwide will navigate this challenging landscape, striving to strike a balance between control and respect for individual rights.\nIn the midst of this digital age, where even ankle tags can be dubbed “British Rolexes,” the conversation continues about how to ensure immigration enforcement that is not only effective but also adaptable to the resourcefulness of those it seeks to monitor.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-exploiting-greta-thunberg-was-disgraceful/content_128.html": "This week, the UN climate conference was hijacked by a 16 year old Swedish girl, Greta Thunberg, who made a passionate speech, that was obviously scripted by her supervisor, who works for one.org, an organisation that is funded by George soros, amongst others. The people behind this mass hysteria are manipulating the youth en mass, in to a frenzy of fear that the end of the world is coming. There is even a new buzz-word for this, it is called ‘Eco-anziety’\nwithout a carefully rehearsed script to work from, Greta doesn’t really have a lot to say, as can be seen in the video below, where she is asked a simple question by a reporter, but after glancing at her supervisor for help, Greta suggested that the reporter ask other people.\nThe response to any questioning of this carefully staged insult, is one of ‘conspiracy’ or the fact that Greta has Asperger’s, means that questioning the cynical reasons for her performance. The world’s media and the sheep all over social media have been busy attacking anyone who can see through this pre-meditated insult, by accusing them of attacking an innocent child.\nGreta is not to blame here, she is just a child, but she is a child who has been brainwashed, terrified and is being exploited by the people behind her, to nurture a culture of hate by the young, for the old.\nIn fact, the degree of passion, fear and hate that is being cultivated in people like Greta is very reminiscent of the ‘Hitler Youth’ Where will this end, will this next generation happily support the punishment of the older generation? Will they support going to any lengths to ‘save the planet’ that is about to end, by turning a blind eye to the so called solution that the instigators of this media show reveal in good time.\nThere are many sources of unbiased facts to refute this scaremongering campaign, but as expected, most of the dedicated scientists who have evidence that we are being lied to are kept out of the lime light, discredited or ridiculed.\nHere is a chart with the historical trends of average global temperature and the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Correlation? The idea that CO2 is the regulator of Earth’s temperature is counterfactual, yet the narrative that human emissions of CO2 will produce a climate disaster is routinely drummed into our children.\nGreta Thunberg has been indoctrinated with climate alarmism, and so have American students. The National Environmental Education Act of 1990 mandated that our public schools’ environmental curriculum be cleared through the Office for Environmental Education at the EPA. This means that warnings of global warming have been pounded into our kids for many years. There is even a famous recording of Al Gore telling children a decade ago to pay attention to what their schools teach them about climate change, because schools have the latest “scientific” information and their parents don’t.\nWhat we know with certainty is this: 1) It is impossible to predict the climate (the U.N.’s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change correctly stated this) and 2) Natural disasters and horrific weather events are unavoidable, but the more prosperous human societies become, the better able we are to cope with and survive nature’s fury, and that is good news indeed.\nThe climate-change cabal has succeeded in making Greta Thunberg a poster child for their movement. Inadvertently, they also have made her a poster child for the cynical exploitation of innocent children. Shame on them.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_elon-musk-disables-starlink-in-ukraine/content_367.html": "Elon Musk Disables Starlink in Ukraine\nElon Musk’s Starlink Dilemma: A Balancing Act Amidst Geopolitical Tensions\nIntroduction:\nElon Musk, the maverick entrepreneur behind SpaceX and Tesla, recently found himself at the center of a controversy involving his Starlink communications network and the ongoing conflict in Crimea. The story unfolds against a backdrop of geopolitical tension, with accusations of complicity, evil deeds, and moral dilemmas. In this blog post, we will delve into the details of this intriguing saga.\nA Refusal to Provide Access:\nElon Musk revealed that he had refused Kyiv’s request for access to Starlink over Crimea to avoid being drawn into what he called a “major act of war.” Kyiv had sought an emergency request to activate Starlink in Sevastopol, a city housing a significant Russian naval port.\nThe Allegations and Accusations:\nThis controversy erupted after the release of Walter Isaacson’s biography of Elon Musk. The book alleged that Musk had turned off Starlink to thwart a drone attack on Russian ships. A senior Ukrainian official accused him of “committing evil” by enabling Russian attacks on civilians.\nThe Ukrainian official claimed that by denying access to Starlink, Musk allowed Russian naval vessels to participate in deadly attacks on civilians, including firing Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities. The accusatory tone towards Musk was palpable, with questions raised about whether he was inadvertently aiding war criminals.\nSpaceX’s Role:\nSpaceX, where Elon Musk is the largest shareholder, had been providing thousands of Starlink satellite dishes to Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale assault on its neighbor in February of the previous year. These satellite terminals were crucial for maintaining internet connectivity and communication in Ukraine as the conflict disrupted the country’s infrastructure.\nMusk’s Response:\nIn response to the allegations in Isaacson’s book, Musk denied deactivating Starlink and clarified that it had not been activated in those regions in the first place. He revealed that there was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink in Sevastopol, with the apparent intent of sinking a significant portion of the Russian fleet at anchor.\nMusk’s firm refusal stemmed from his belief that complying with the request would make SpaceX explicitly complicit in a “major act of war” and escalate the conflict further. He emphasized that Starlink was never intended to be used for long-range drone strikes but rather for peaceful purposes like education and entertainment.\nGeopolitical Background:\nTo understand the gravity of the situation, it’s essential to note that Russia had illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, eight years before launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The region has been a focal point of international tension.\nMusk’s Plea for Peace:\nIn addition to defending his position, Musk offered a personal opinion, calling for a truce in the conflict. He argued that Ukrainians and Russians were losing their lives over “small pieces of land” and that such sacrifices were not worth the territorial disputes.\nControversial Proposals:\nMusk had previously sparked controversy by proposing a plan to end the war, suggesting the formal recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and allowing residents of seized regions to vote on their preferred country. This proposal received criticism, with Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov labeling it as “moral idiocy.”\nConclusion:\nElon Musk’s refusal to provide access to Starlink over Crimea highlights the intricate ethical and geopolitical challenges faced by technology giants in a world marked by conflict. As tensions persist, Musk’s actions raise profound questions about the role of technology in international disputes and the moral responsibilities of those who control it. The story continues to evolve, underscoring the complex interplay between innovation, geopolitics, and the quest for peace in a troubled world.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-true-demographic-crisis-of-immigration/content_596.html": "The true demographic crisis of immigration\nWhat if immigration is a far more calculated phenomenon than we have been led to believe?\nOver the past few years, immigration has become the ‘topic of the moment’ with MPs standing (and falling) due the ability or inability to control the mass immigration that the UK and Europe as a whole has endured over the last decade or two, but what is really the case?\nWe have been constantly told that this is a crisis, that these people are forcing their way in to our country, the government is taking steps to cut immigration and so on, and so on. On one side we have people presented as ‘racists’ because they object to the constant deluge of immigrants which has been thrust upon us, on the other, we have the ‘virtue signalling’ left, the BBC and the Guardian amongst many others, who sing the virtues of immigration, the need for compassion and the contribution that immigrants make to our society.\nHowever, the reality could be far removed from the narrative, so what’s really going on here?\nLet’s play Devil’s Advocate:\nRather than address the current narrative, which is that these people are fleeing to come here and what we do about it, is dependant upon our moral ocompass, let’s turn this around, but first, here are some interesting statistics:\nItaly is suffering the largest degree of depopulation in Europe, for the first time in 90 years the number of Italian citizens living in Italy has fallen to about 55 million, according to the national statistics agency (ISTAT). From 2014 to 2018, the number of Italian citizens resident in the country decreased by 677,000.\nIf the UK were to suffer the same fate, our population would now be around 40 million!\nPoland is also suffering serious depopulation, in 1946 the first post-war census counted 23.9 million people. As elsewhere in Europe, the ensuing baby-boom meant that the population grew fast, and it was to peak in 1996 at 38.3 million. At current rates, according to Eurostat, the EU’s statistical agency, Poland’s population could have shrunk to 34.1 million by 2050 and to 27.65 million by 2100.\nAlbania, although not in the EU, is still in mainland Europe and it is suffering the highest degree of depopulation, 2,845,955 people live in Albania (2020) Over 1.68 million Albanian citizens live outside their homeland, most of whom are men.\nAccording to a survey conducted in June 2020, 50% of Albanian citizens are still considering leaving the country (83% want to leave, and 49% are seriously considering such a decision). This is the largest number in the region, and Albania is the only country in the Balkans where the number of people willing to leave is higher than those who wish to stay.\nThere are similar stories from other former Eastern Block countries, who are having severe problems, due the exodus of their young male population, which has handicapped their infrastructure, their growth and is increasingly causing problems for them to pay for their aging populations.\nWhilst the UK, Germany and France have in parallel benefitted from the swelling of their young male population, I say benefitted, because like the rest of the western world, we have been suffering a severe decline in the birth rate, which would be a serious problem for our society over the next two of three decades at the current rate, or rather it would have been, were in not for immigration.\nWe need only take a look around our towns and cities in the UK, to see the incredible number of young immigrants, who tend to have children at a higher rate than us. We are already suffering a severe shortage of workers in the UK and that is after twenty years of relentless immigration from the EU, despite the pressure on housing, imagine where our industry would be if we had not had that?\nIs the notion of cutting immigration a smoke-screen for fulfilling a need for the UK?\nWhat if the reality is that the UK, Germany and France are actually engaged in an agenda to ‘harvest’ the young men of poorer nations for their own ends? We already know for a fact, that without the immigration of the last few decades, we would be in dire straits. We also know that the birth rate in these countries is collapsing, for a variety of reasons.\nWe also know for a fact, that young white men in the UK are, for a variety of reasons, increasingly withdrawing from relationships, marriage and fathering children, (the reasons for this are an entirely different story) what better way to address this than to flood the UK with millions of young, fertile, motivated men, who will not waste time fathering as many children as possible. The ratio of young single men to young single women may be changing, which only serves to further alienate British young men, but that is irrelevant, what matters is the birth rate and the ratio of young people to old.\nWhat is it that the UK, France and Germany really need?\nIn the first instance, they need young people, as I have already stated, without the existing immigration, the aging demographic of these countries would be like an upside down triangle, with the old people at the top, and a small number of young people at the bottom, struggling to pay for them. These people are actually needed to prop-up our aging and dwindling population. The government does not care about the pressure on housing, the social tensions, the lack of resources, or any of the other issues caused by mass immigration, after all, for the main part, it does not affect them. What they really care about, is balancing the books.\nWe are told that many immigrants are claiming benefits, or they are criminals or maybe they are sending money back home, that may or may not be the case, but one thing is for certain, if they are here, like it or not, they buy food, they buy cars, they pay rent, they rotate money and with every rotation, the Government takes a cut through VAT, amongst other things, like the proverbial ‘Madame’ no matter who gets ‘screwed’ she gets her cut.\nDo we have motive yet?\nI believe that we do. I put it to you, that we have no concern for the nations that are supplying us with these people, I put it to you that the bleeding heart lefties, who purport to be so supportive of these people, are actually repeating the narrative of distraction, that has been the secret policy of the government for years.\nI also fervently believe that the governments of the ‘immigrant destinations’ are more than capable of stopping immigration, but they refuse to, sighting one excuse after another for their failure to do so, after all, they cannot and would not admit the truth.\nThat’s true, but they send money home which helps, doesn’t it?\nYes, that is true, but what does the arrival of money with Western Union, along with images of the successful migrants living a life that is far removed from the one they left behind achieve? It only serves to encourage more to come here. We have all seen the images on social-media, taken by successful arriving migrants, demonstrating their joy are reaching the ‘promised land’ flaunting their mobile phones, their cars, their clothes and their money, what a wonderful PR campaign for continued migration.\nMany come here just to work for a few years and then return home, don’t they?\nYes, that is true, many immigrants do not care where they go, they want a better life, they want to make money, perhaps provide for their families, save up to buy a property in their homeland and then one day, return in glory, but the reality is that this hardly ever happens. As time goes by, people assimilate by some degree, be it willingly or unwillingly, this is the case with most immigrants, even those who come from very religious or strict communities, they gradually evolve, sometimes without realising that they are. One thing is for certain, if they don’t, their children certainly will, because they would have been raised here, English would be their first language and no matter how much they cling on to their faith, culture and tradition, they have been assimilated and their is nothing they can do to change that.\nThere are of course many who do get to their fifties, sixties and beyond, who have money, a home in their country of origin, who finally decide to repatriate and move back to their homeland, spending their twilight years with their family and former friends, but the reality is far removed from the fairy tale that they have imagined through all the years that they were working, saving and sending money home, for their ‘happy ever after’ because what invariably happens, is that when they return home, they begin to realise that their home, is no longer their home. Indeed, even if it is, that is not the case for their children, who were born and raised in the UK, for them, it is not home, the UK is home,\nFor most, and I have personal experience of this with my own parents, the ‘grand return’ to their motherland is little more than a broken dream, a bitter-sweet moment, when they leave everything that they have become accustomed to behind, their children, grandchildren and their friends. They find that the friends and family that they left behind, many years ago are now little more than strangers. They miss the most unexpected elements of British life, be it their new friends, the way of life, the freedom, the fairness, or even the rain!\nOnce again, I put it to you, that the reality behind immigration is not a losing battle that we are powerless to restrain, it is a cynical and calculated theft of human resources from poorer nations, who have nothing else to contribute, so we therefore steal that which is most precious to them, their people.\nI also stand by my belief that the notion of the sympathetic left, is little more than hypocrisy on a grand scale, their posturing, sympathy and support for ‘people who flee their homeland’ is little more than another voice of support for the narrative, for this is without doubt, the most calculated demographic political mission in recent history.\nOMG! I had never thought about it this way before, this really makes sense and explains everything.\nI work in the public sector, I have taken pride in helping people fleeing their homelands, but now I feel that I have been part of the theft of their people, this really hits home.\nWell done.",

As of today, there are over 300,000 people without a place to call home in the UK, but this number only accounts for the visible homeless population. When we consider the hidden homeless—those who couch surf or stay with friends and family—the actual figure is likely double that, and it’s increasing daily.\nSeveral years ago, I created a video in an attempt to rally the people of Northampton and encourage them to utilize the numerous vacant spaces across the city to create shelters for the homeless. While the response included thousands of views and promises of goodwill, nothing substantial materialized from these efforts. The empty warehouse featured in my video has remained vacant for over a decade.\nAcross the country, there are countless offices, warehouses, and other properties sitting idle while individuals endure the harsh reality of sleeping on the streets. This issue extends beyond commercial spaces; there are approximately 600,000 properties in the UK that are derelict, vacant, or unfit for habitation. These are not properties that large developers, driven by profit, are interested in revitalizing. Instead, it’s the British public who possesses a deep love for property, renovation, and the potential for a modest profit who would be willing to take on these projects.\nHowever, despite the willingness of the public, both the current and past governments have failed to provide adequate incentives to spur property renovation and address homelessness effectively. Instead of facilitating these efforts, the government has implemented policies such as the three percent stamp duty surcharge for non-primary residence purchases and the reduction of capital gains tax. These measures have disincentivized property renovation and decreased the number of properties being revitalized.\nA Call for Change: Tax Incentives and Greater Accessibility\nWhat the government should have done is offer financial incentives to motivate individuals to renovate these properties and bring them back into use. Simultaneously, there should be incentives for owners of empty buildings to at least make them available for emergency shelters. Many industrial units, for instance, are owned by pension funds that care little about the impact of their vacant properties on society.\nTo combat homelessness and make use of our nation’s vast housing stock, which should be considered a national asset rather than individual possessions, we must adopt a new perspective. Our beautiful properties have stood long before our time and will continue to do so after we’re gone. We are merely stewards of these spaces, and it is the government’s responsibility to incentivize their continual improvement rather than allowing them to fall into disrepair.\nIn conclusion, it is unacceptable for any citizen to sleep on the streets, regardless of their circumstances or background. While some individuals who have broken the law find themselves in hotels, flaunting their stay on social media, it’s unconscionable that fellow citizens born and bred in this country are left without shelter. It’s time for a change—a change that includes tax incentives for property renovation and measures to ensure that our housing stock remains a source of pride and dignity for all. The time to act is now, for a brighter, more inclusive future for all UK residents.",

The poll, conducted exclusively for GB News, puts Labour on a commanding 45% of the vote, with the Tories languishing far behind on just 20%.\nIn further bad news for Sunak, the poll shows that Reform UK, led by Richard Tice, has overtaken the Liberal Democrats as the third most popular party, with 12% support. This puts Tice’s insurgent outfit just 7 points behind the Conservatives. Among 2019 Tory voters, a worrying 14% say they would now vote Reform UK.\nSunak Failing to Inspire Confidence or Loyalty\nThe polling indicates that Sunak has comprehensively failed to assert his authority or inspire confidence since taking office. When asked who they would like to see replace him as Prime Minister, just 8% opted for Nigel Farage, with 7% preferring a return for Boris Johnson. 51% said that they do not favour any of the touted alternatives from within the Conservative party.\nThis shows that the Tories are sorely lacking credible leadership options to renew public trust. After 14 years of Conservative rule, their brand appears irreparably tarnished.\nPlummeting Patriotism Among British Youth\nOne of the most concerning findings was related to patriotism among the younger generation. When asked if they would voluntarily fight for their country in the event of another World War, just 14% of 18-24 year-olds said yes. This compares to 17% across all age groups.\nGenerational attitudes towards British identity appear to be rapidly shifting, with younger Brits increasingly disillusioned. The polling points to a lack of clear messaging from politicians about what modern British values are and why they are worth defending.\nPublic Split on School Prayer Ban\nThe poll also gauged public reaction towards a controversial decision to ban all prayer groups at an inner-city London school. 38% said they support the headteacher’s stance, while 28% oppose the prohibition of prayer under any circumstances.\nThis polarising issue taps into much broader debates around integration, multiculturalism, and religious freedom in education. With views sharply divided along partisan lines, it has the potential to become a political flashpoint.\nReform UK Well-Placed to Capitalise on Tory Collapse\nPolitical analyst Matt Goodwin, who oversaw the polling, believes Sunak’s Conservatives are now facing an “enormous hole” where their core support once lay. This creates major opportunities for insurgents like Reform UK.\nGoodwin even raises the possibility that Reform could be polling higher than the Tories before the next general election. This opens up the potential for a major realignment on the Right, akin to when the Reform Party displaced Canada’s Conservatives in 1993.\nMajor Challenges Ahead for Britain\nWhile this exclusive new polling makes grim reading for Rishi Sunak, its wider implications for Britain’s political landscape are even more concerning. Labour appears headed towards a landslide victory come the election, but the weakening of the Conservative establishment risks leaving moderate voters disenfranchised.\nWith patriotism plummeting among young people, and the country lacking stable, inspiring leadership, Britain faces major challenges ahead in defining its national identity and values for a new generation. Our politicians would do well to take note of this turbulent public mood.\nKey Takeaways\n* Labour holds a massive 25-point lead over the Conservatives in latest polling\n* Just 17% of British people now willing to voluntarily fight for their country\n* Patriotism is plummeting fastest among young people aged 18-24\n* 51% say they don’t want any touted replacements for PM Sunak\n* Reform UK now polling in third place on 12%, just 7 points behind Tories\n* Reform well-placed to capitalize on the Tories’ collapse under Sunak’s leadership\n* Conservatives face a growing existential crisis and could be overtaken by Reform UK\n* Britain lacks stable, inspiring leadership to unify country and define modern British identity\n* Labour headed for landslide victory at next election as things stand\nThe polling indicates growing disillusionment with the political status quo in Britain. With the Conservatives hemorrhaging support and the rise of populist challenger parties, we appear headed for a period of unpredictability and flux in UK politics not seen for a generation.",

Revelations of what the Cypriot president called “negligence” on the part of some police officers led to the justice minister’s resignation while the police chief was fired.\nThe suspect, who authorities haven’t formally identified, faces an additional charge of raping a woman he contacted through a social media platform. The woman, who was 19 in early 2017 when the alleged rape took place, told police the suspect had sex with her against her will in his car when he picked her up supposedly to give her modelling photographs he took of her.\nThe suspect is denying the rape allegation. Wearing a bulletproof vest, he represented himself in court on Monday and said he didn’t object to his detention.\nThe chance discovery of the bound body of Mary Rose Tiburcio, 38, from the Philippines, down an abandoned mineshaft triggered an investigation last month that led to the suspect’s arrest.\nThe suspect confessed to seven killings in a 10-page handwritten note and took investigators to where he dumped some of his victims.\nThey include a poisonous lake that is part of a disused copper mine where he said he disposed of the bodies of Bunea, her daughter and another Filipino woman after placing them in suitcases. Divers have so far retrieved two suitcases from the lake and are continuing to search for a third.\nA separate search is being carried out at another lake where the suspect said he dumped the body of Tiburcio’s 6-year-old daughter Sierra Grace.\nInvestigators said the suspect, who is divorced and has two children, had a six-month relationship with Tiburcio before she and her daughter vanished in May 2018.",

We have a population crisis, and unless that crisis is addressed at the highest level, no matter how many houses we build, we still will not be able to keep up. Just to give you an idea of how things stand, here are some figures for you: in London, nearly half of all social housing—47.6%—is headed by a foreign-born person, and in the private sector, it is a staggering 67%.\nIn order for house building to meet the demand caused by migration at the current rates—without it growing any more, which it will—we would need to build 1,150 villages the size of West Harbury every year. We do have more than enough housing stock for our population, especially if we take into account the 670,000 empty homes throughout England, not to mention the fact that we have brownfield capacity for up to 2 million homes. But we cannot house the world.\nUnfortunately, those who tend to sympathise with or even encourage immigration do not realise the potential for this catastrophe to snowball. There are globally millions, hundreds of millions, of people who want to head towards Europe, many of those to the UK. We simply cannot cope. Behind the scenes, in addition to all of the agendas that we may be concerned about, one thing that we do know for certain is that there is a crisis with an ageing population and not enough people working to support them. That is something that we should be addressing throughout Europe in a much more constructive way rather than actually opening the floodgates and allowing millions of people to come into this country, who take up our housing, take up our essential services, and become a burden on the state. Because a large number of these people who arrive here sit on benefits and add to the drain on this country’s resources, meaning that the government then looks to allowing even more in to cater for them. It is sheer madness, and it cannot go on.\nWe need to address this, and we need to address this sooner rather than later because this is the greatest catastrophe that we have faced in recent decades, and unless we do something about it, I can see this escalating into a national emergency within our lifetimes.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-anti-israel-lefts-ugly-new-low/content_636.html": "The Anti-Israel Left’s Ugly New Low\nTargeting a Young Pop Singer\nWhy is a young female Israeli pop singer being treated as if she’s somehow to blame for what’s happening in Gaza? The time has come for our leaders to face the horrifying truth: a possible genocide is under way. Since this awful conflict began last year, countless thousands of innocent people have been killed, many of them children, while thousands more are now desperate refugees.\nNo, I’m not talking about Gaza. I’m talking about Sudan. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch published a report detailing the atrocities that have been committed during the ongoing war in Sudan, which broke out in April last year.\nYet here’s a curious thing. Despite that conflict’s savage brutality, I don’t recall seeing any mass protests against it in the West. London is not swarmed every Saturday by hundreds of thousands of enraged demonstrators brandishing placards that liken the RSF (a Sudanese paramilitary force) to the Nazis. Nor have university campuses in the US and the UK been overrun by students shrieking that they stand with the Masalit (an ethnic group the RSF is accused of massacring) and calling for “ceasefire now” in Darfur. Come to think of it, I’m not sure I can recall Western Left-wing activists even mentioning the RSF.\nGreta Thunberg’s Misguided Protest\nSo furious is their hatred of Israel, however, that thousands of them have taken to the streets this week to rage against a young, female Israeli pop singer.\nEden Golan, who is just 20 years old, is Israel’s representative at this year’s Eurovision Song Contest. And for days, the city of Malmö in Sweden – where the contest is being held – has been overwhelmed by anti-Israel protesters, demanding that she be expelled from the competition. Spotted among the crowds on Thursday, as it happens, was Greta Thunberg, proudly wearing a Palestinian-style keffiyeh scarf. Previously famed for her campaigning against climate change, Ms Thunberg has recently expanded her repertoire by campaigning against Israel, as well.\n“Young people are leading the way,” she told Reuters, “and showing the world how we should react to this.”\nIs she quite sure? Are young people “leading the way” by treating a 20-year-old female pop singer as if she were somehow responsible for the actions of the Israeli military? Are they “leading the way” by leaving this poor woman with no option but to stay holed up in her Swedish hotel room all day, surrounded by security guards, for the sake of her own safety? And are they “showing the world how we should react” by booing her as she sings a song whose lyrics were reportedly written as a lament for the Israeli civilians who were kidnapped, raped and murdered on October 7?\nPersonally, I’m not convinced. In fact, I would say that, for the anti-Israel Left, this week’s scenes from Sweden represent an ugly new low. And it may grow uglier still, as Ms Golan is due to perform at tonight’s Eurovision final.\nA Call for Perspective\nGiven that their behaviour is only likely to undermine their cause, perhaps these blinkered bullies should consider taking the evening off. And if they need something else to be angry about in the meantime, they could always try googling Sudan. Country in Africa. Great big landmass, just below Europe. They can’t miss it.\nThe Nuisance of Bicycles on Trains\nOn your bike, cyclists\nTo deter passengers from placing their luggage on empty seats, train guards have reportedly started threatening to impose fines. Quite right, too. As a regular passenger myself, however, there is one sight that I find even more enraging than suitcases on seats.\nBicycles propped by the doors.\nHaving to spend your entire journey standing in a packed carriage is bad enough. But it’s unbearable when there are whacking great bikes taking up space, too. If someone has placed their luggage on a seat, you can at least tell them to remove it. But you can’t very well tell them to remove their bike. There’s nowhere else for it to go. And however tempted you may be to try wrapping the infernal thing round its owner’s neck, you must resist. Aluminium is notoriously difficult to tie a knot in, so you might easily do yourself an injury.\nLike all prime ministers nearing the end of their tenure, Rishi Sunak is eager to leave behind some kind of legacy. Something he did that changed Britain for the better. I suggest he bans cyclists from trains.\nThen again, if he bans them from trains, they’ll spend more time on the roads. Poor Mr Sunak. In politics, there really are no easy answers.\nThe Dimwitted “Gender-Neutral” Loo Argument\nThe stupidest argument for ‘gender-neutral’ loos\nFreddie Bailey, a Labour councillor, seems not to understand why the Tories want to make single-sex loos a legal requirement in all new bars, restaurants and offices. “I use gender-neutral toilets at home every day,” he tweeted this week.\nIt’s remarkable how often, and how smugly, progressives make this point. So perhaps it’s time to explain to them why it’s so stupendously dim. Women may be willing to use the same loo as their husbands and sons. But they tend to be rather less keen to use the same loo as large numbers of revoltingly unhygienic men they’ve never met. And few enjoy having to walk past a row of such men using the urinal.\nIf progressives truly believe that there is no difference between gender-neutral loos in public buildings and their “gender-neutral” bathrooms at home, they should leave their front doors permanently unlocked, so that strange men can pop in and use their facilities any time they like.",

The revelation, reported by The Herald newspaper, has shed light on the training materials being used to guide officers in the enforcement of the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, which comes into effect on 1st April.\nThe timing of the law’s introduction, coinciding with April Fool’s Day – a occasion traditionally marked by laughter and mirth – has not gone unnoticed. There are fears that, rather than inspiring chuckles, this year’s celebrations may be muted by an air of caution and restraint amongst Scotland’s renowned comedic talent.\nAt the heart of the consternation lies the Hate Crime Act’s potential to stifle artistic expression and open discourse. The legislation, which has been contentious since its conception under former Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, now First Minister, has raised alarms that it could be weaponised to steer the gender ideology debate in a particular direction.\nThe prospect of comedians being targeted for their material has struck a chord in a nation renowned for its vibrant comedy scene and revered funnymen, such as Frankie Boyle, Kevin Bridges, and the inimitable Glaswegian, Limmy. The iconic Stand Comedy Club in Glasgow, a veritable institution that has hosted countless comedic legends throughout their careers, now finds itself at the epicentre of this burgeoning controversy.\nAs Tony Maguire, GB News’ Scotland reporter, remarked outside the hallowed venue, “Scotland has some of those comedians like Frankie Boyle, Kevin Bridges, and of course our own Limmy. It’s very much a case of let’s wait and see who’s laughing on the 1st of April.”\nThe Hate Crime Act’s potential reach extends beyond the realm of comedy, with implications for a wide range of performers and artistic endeavours. Its provisions encompass offences such as “misgendering” individuals, a transgression that has already prompted defiance from high-profile figures like acclaimed author J.K. Rowling, who has vowed to deliberately flout the law to test its boundaries.\nMaguire encapsulated the gravity of the situation, stating, “It seems that maybe for the first time, it’s going to be rather some cautious laughter this year.”\nThe concerns surrounding the Hate Crime Act are not limited to the potential curtailment of comedic expression. Critics have raised broader fears about its potential to impinge upon free speech more generally, with some perceiving it as a draconian measure that could have far-reaching consequences for public discourse in Scotland.\nSupporters of the legislation, however, argue that it is a necessary step in combating hate speech and promoting inclusivity within Scottish society. They contend that the law provides a framework for protecting vulnerable groups from targeted harassment and discrimination, while still allowing for robust debate and artistic expression within reasonable bounds.\nAs the 1st of April looms, a date synonymous with mirth and tomfoolery, the spectre of the Hate Crime Act casts a long shadow over Scotland’s comedy scene. Performers and audiences alike find themselves navigating uncharted territory, where the boundaries between acceptable humour and potentially criminal speech remain ambiguous.\nIn this climate of uncertainty, the once-raucous laughter that echoed through the hallowed halls of venues like The Stand may give way to a more muted, cautious chuckle – a disquieting prospect for a nation that has long prided itself on its irreverent wit and satirical prowess.\nAs the curtain rises on this new era of regulated speech, all eyes will be on Scotland’s comedians and performers, who now find themselves thrust into the unlikely role of free speech vanguards. Their ability to navigate the",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-the-crisis-in-ukraine-was-inevitable/content_593.html": "The last few decades have seen the west become obsessed with all things woke. We are more concerned about using the correct pronouns, or the correct collective nouns, or stopping to think before we address anyone by gender, quite frankly the whole thing has become race to the bottom of social bankruptcy.\nWe’ve allowed a sulky, vegan teenager from Sweden to dictate the West’s energy policy.\nHow’s that working out for you?\nAs Russian tanks roll towards the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, which I predict will be taken by Sunday, the woke West, with its self-destructive obsession with net zero, has only itself to blame. Far from challenging and threatening the evil dictator Vladimir Putin, following his completely unacceptable annexation of Crimea in 2014, we have instead enriched him with the purchase of billions of dollars of oil, coal and gas and we have given him the strategic whip hand over countries like Germany.\nThe Germans now look set to have a very expensive and cold winter, given their reliance on old Vladimir’s fuel.\nThe sanctions meted out to Putin have been weaker than an arm wrestle with your grandma, and the Europeans are dragging their heels on blocking Russia’s access to the Swift global payments system – something we are ready to do – and which would hurt Moscow bigtime.\nWhat we are witnessing now, as apartment blocks in the democratic nation of Ukraine are struck by missiles, is a failure of values.\nThe west, so complacent and arrogant in their economic and military dominance, have turned a blind eye to what’s actually been going on. They’ve been asleep at the wheel. Anyone could’ve told you that Vladimir Putin has for years been trying to reassemble the Soviet union, a hellish totalitarian bloc we thought we’d consigned to the dustbin of history, under the heroic leadership of Ronald Reagan, Michael Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher.\nThat’s political leadership.\nAnd the real crime here is that we have helped Vlad the bad all the way. Here in the UK for example, we have deliberately chosen not to have energy independence. According to the Mail’s Ross Clark, we have chosen to ignore potentially 20 years worth of oil in the North Sea, five decades worth of clean shale gas from under our feet and potentially five hundred years worth of coal, deep in the ground.\nWe’ve also torn ourselves apart with the woke take over of our culture and history.\nTearing down statues and desecrating our glorious past. One which was not perfect, of course, but which has seen billions of people lifted out of poverty, and democracy and free markets rolled out across the world.\nI’d love to know why we’ve got to apologise for that. The woke West is now more interested in pronouns than peace.\nIn the same week that the MI5 chief Ken Mccallum rightly said that our way of life is now under threat from the likes of Russia, China and Islamic extremists, a leaked guide to improving diversity and inclusion in the security services suggests that spies should check their white privilege and avoid gendered terms such as ‘manpower’ and words such as ‘strong’ and ‘grip’ which can ‘reinforce dominant cultural patterns’. Get a grip.\nWhy we’ve been attacking men of late is a total mystery to me. Because whilst we have incredible women in the military – of course – we’re going to be relying on one hell of a lot of toxic masculinity, if our soldiers are ultimately dragged into this sorry mess.\nAnd then there’s the pandemic. Another example of stupefying western arrogance. When in human history have we ever successfully stopped a seasonal respiratory virus?\nBut oh no, the west knew better. We will send this virus packing said Boris Johnson. And Joe Biden declared war on Covid. A nasty virus yes but one non-fatal to most and with a third having no symptoms at all – it’s not a war. Do me a favour. Helicopters and fighter jets flying over Ukraine, China with aerial manoeuvres over Taiwan. That’s what a bloody war looks like.\nBut deliberately crippling our economy for two years as a matter of pandemic policy, has diminished the tools we would need to fight this real war. This truly existential crisis. I hate to be right, it doesn’t happen very often. But I’ve been stuck record since March 2020 about the billions we are borrowing and burning in this fruitless war against Covid, reducing our economic firepower for and this is a direct quote “a future pandemic, potentially worse than this one, a future natural disaster or God forbid, a future war”.\nWell here we are. We’ve appeased Putin for a decade and it hasn’t worked. Another pint-sized dictator French President Emanuel Macron was humiliated this week in a phone call with Vladimir Putin, who told the Frenchman where to go.\nHe knows his onions does old Vladimir. Not a great reward for Macron’s love bombing of Putin over the years. That’s what happens when you suck up to a bully. But this has been the abiding theme for too long. The West’s botched departure from Afghanistan was the very essence of what a weak foreign policy looks like. It equates in no uncertain terms to surrender.\nYes we want jaw-jaw, as Churchill used to describe diplomacy, and a diplomatic solution could still be in the offing once old Vladimir has flexed his muscles strutted his stuff and proved his point. So where do we go from here? Well we change tack. We need a plan for power.\nIt’s time to completely scrap the so-called war on Covid and get back to an active, uncompromising, thriving economy with which to pay for the colossal investment required by our armed services, as well as all of the other offices of state battered by bonkers lockdowns.\nWe need planes, helicopters, troops, counter terrorism, counter cyber – you name it we’ve got to counter it. We need all of that, rather than rainbow pedestrian crossings and gender inclusive police cars. We need robust energy independence.\nI would like to see the exploitation of every drop of shale gas you can find and until renewables can punch their weight, which in time they will, and we must develop that too, then oil and gas on our own shores will see us through.\nAnd we need to recalibrate our attitude to risk, given what was in my view an overreaction to a virus mild for most. So this is it folks, it’s a wake up call. A reality check. A woke country is a broke country, as we are finding out.\nIt’s time to fight for the very essence of what Western societies stand for.\nIt’s time for Britain and its allies to man up and grow a pair. Because if we don’t, with China, Russia and others circling their wagons around the free world, it may be lost forever.",

Is this the start of the end for the Euro?\nThere are many factors that have contributed to this fall, but it had to happen at some point. The Euro was at best a pseudo-currency that would always be doomed, held together with political rhetoric and collusion by the unelected, unaccountable and arrogant EU commissioners, who were always concerned with their own vision.\nThe Euro has fallen by 20% over the last two years, there is every possibility that it could fall by another 20% over the next two years, taking it in to junk territory. Once the tide of falling confidence begins to evolve in to a tsunami, anything is possible. With every fall in the Euro, the balance of payments rises as imported goods cost more and subsequently inflation will also rise.\nThe energy crisis caught Europe by surprise, despite being warned, they pursued a policy of becoming increasingly reliant on Russian Gas, then due to the sanctions and Putin’s demands to be paid in Rubles, they were unable to meet their needs. This led to the start of the ‘triangle of hypocrisy’ which is Russian Gas being sold to China, then quietly being sold by China to Germany, at inflated prices. It’s still the same gas, the money still makes its way to Russia, but thanks to its own arrogance and bad energy policies, Germany was now paying several times the previous rate, for the same gas, yielding China a massive profit.\nThis also had the effect of pushing up wholesale gas prices worldwide, therefore, the UK which only had a small dependence on Russian gas (it should had been zero) is now paying several times the price that it was previously.\nThe UK will recover much sooner, as we have the means to plug the gap very quickly, from the North sea and fracking, but the wholesale prices will still remain high for the foreseeable, pushing the poorest quarter, or even one third, of the UK population in to fuel poverty.\nBack in Europe, the cracks are being exacerbated by the cost of energy, inflation and recession, added to an already fragile structure that is based on massive debt, due to the insistence of the EU to expand, taking in countries that were not in economic sync with the Eurozone.\nAs it stands, the EU is caught between a rock and a hard place, on the one hand, they need to take drastic action to prop-up the Euro, but doing so, could push fragile economies, like Italy and Greece over the edge. If Italy in particular were to fall off a cliff-edge, there would be no salvation for the Euro, it could not survive the massive debt of Italy, the consequences could be catastrophic, to say the least.\nAs it stands, Germany has managed to stock up to 80% capacity, it needs to reach 85% to survive the winter, then at that point it could be in a position where it will not need to take the highest price when buying gas, but that will not repair the damage that has been done already.\nThe EU has managed to pull a Rabbit out of the hat many times, to protect the Euro, it remains to be seen if they will be able to do so once again, but as it stands, the Euro is now in the most precarious position that it has ever been.\nOnly time will tell, but for those who have any significant exposure to the Euro should think very carefully about their position, because as it stands, anything could happen.",

Accusations of insulting the electorate and implementing a “Marxist agenda”\n2. Claims of biased policing and judicial system abuse\n3. Criticism of economic policies, including changes to independent school taxation\n4. Allegations of hypocrisy and misconduct against the Prime Minister\n5.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_exploring-the-ramifications-and-urgency-for-action/content_828.html": "Exploring the Ramifications and Urgency for Action\nIntroduction:\nIn the previous blog post, we discussed the growing concern over banks closing accounts of individuals with controversial views, emphasizing the need to protect free speech. Senior Tory backbencher Sir Charles Walker shed light on the misapplication of money laundering rules and the lack of accountability in the banking sector. In this post, we delve deeper into the ramifications of these account closures and the urgency for immediate action.\nThe Implications of Account Closures:\nAccount closures based on political views have far-reaching consequences. It sets a dangerous precedent that financial institutions can wield their power to stifle dissent and silence individuals with differing opinions. Such actions undermine the democratic principles of free speech and open dialogue. If left unchecked, this trend could lead to a chilling effect on public discourse, as individuals fear reprisals for expressing their views.\nThe Need for Urgent Action:\nSir Charles Walker rightly points out that the current protections in place, outlined in the Bank of England Financial Services Act 2016, are ineffective if not enforced. It is imperative for regulatory bodies like the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Ombudsman to address complaints promptly and hold banks accountable for their actions. The government’s proposed legislative amendments should aim to strengthen these protections and ensure their implementation.\nPreserving a Fair Society:\nProtecting free speech goes beyond political affiliations. Sir Charles rightly highlights that if the political winds were to change, individuals from any background could face similar discrimination. It is crucial to create a fair society that upholds democratic values, irrespective of the party in power. Stricter enforcement of existing laws, along with necessary amendments, will foster an environment where differing opinions can coexist without fear of financial retribution.\nThe Role of the Media:\nThe media plays a significant role in bringing these issues to light. Independent and robust journalism, as exemplified by outlets like the Daily Mail, contributes to holding politicians and financial institutions accountable. The media’s scrutiny acts as a check against any potential misuse of power, ensuring transparency and fairness in the public discourse.\nPublic Engagement and Awareness:\nIndividuals who have faced discriminatory actions must not remain silent. They should exercise their rights by reporting such incidents to the FCA and the Ombudsman. Raising awareness about these issues through public engagement, media coverage, and social media can exert pressure on the banking sector to address the problem promptly. Collective action will reinforce the importance of protecting free speech and encourage others to stand up against any infringements.\nConclusion:\nThe closure of bank accounts based on political views poses a serious threat to free speech and democratic values. Immediate action is necessary to enforce existing protections and introduce further measures to hold banks accountable for their actions. Preserving a fair society requires the cooperation of regulatory bodies, media outlets, and public engagement. By standing together, we can protect the rights of individuals to express their opinions without fear of financial retribution and ensure that free speech remains a cornerstone of our democracy.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_dangerous-search-for-girls-body-continues-as-father-remanded/content_813.html": "Authorities will on Thursday start draining the water in the shaft at a mine in Mitsero where the body of a woman, 39, was found dumped, as they continue their search for the woman’s missing six-year-old daughter. Speaking at the mine, fire department chief, Markos Trangolas, told state broadcaster CyBC on Wednesday that the operation to drain the shaft, which may take two or more days, is an extremely dangerous task as the structure may cave in.\nTrangolas said that the goal is to completely drain the shaft, and that as the water levels are lowered, underwater cameras will be pushed deeper underground to help them establish whether the little girl suffered the same fate as her mother. The woman’s former partner and father of the girl, a 33-year-old Romanian national, was remanded for eight days on Wednesday, after the woman’s decomposed body was found naked, arms and legs bound, and wrapped in a sheet in the mine on Sunday.\nThe authorities are waiting for the results of DNA tests to confirm her identity beyond any doubt, but it is almost certain she is Mary Rose Tiburcio from the Philippines.\nTiburcio had been reported missing by her roommate on May 5, 2018, along with her daughter, Sierra Graze Seucalliuc. The passport of her missing six-year-old daughter has been found at the home of her father. Police said they have also found rope at the suspect’s home, which was similar to the one used to tie up the woman.\nThe roommate had told police that the day prior to her disappearance, Tiburcio had travelled to Nicosia from Larnaca, apparently to meet a man she had met on social media. She and her daughter never returned. On the day of her disappearance, Tiburcio did not take any of her personal effects with her, nor her passport.\nHer body was found on Sunday by two foreign nationals who were recording footage from the area.\nThree more individuals were present at the scene at the time, police said.\n“Two of them went down the shaft and saw the body up close, which was bound with the blue rope, confirming it was human,” lead investigator Ioannis Yiorkadjis told the court. The woman was still wearing two heart-shaped earrings, photos of which were shown to her roommate who recognised them as belonging to the victim.\nState pathologists also found that Tiburcio had two false teeth, a fact raised by her roommate in her statement to police. The court heard that Tiburcio and the suspect had been living together in the past but he used to drink and be abusive. Tiburcio took their daughter and left the man in 2015, cutting off all relations with him. The last time he saw his daughter was in March 2017 when his mother visited from Romania.\nPolice said they found the girl’s passport at his house and blue rope that was similar to the one used to tie the woman’s body. Investigators also seized three mobile phones and three phone cards, which will undergo forensic examination. They also ask the court for permission to access the suspect’s phone records.\nThe man denies harming his child and former partner though he admitted hitting her in the past, police told the court. Police spokesman Andreas Angelides said Wednesday that officers from other districts were called in to help with the investigation.\nFire fighters used special cameras to examine the water-filled shaft, spanning some 130 metres. The authorities were also assessing safety issues as they contemplated sending people down the shaft. Meanwhile the Filipino community in Nicosia were organising a vigil on Sunday in Tiburcio’s memory. The ceremony will be held at the municipal park near the town centre and those taking part should wear plain black t-shirts.",

However, a groundbreaking study by marine biologists at the University of Plymouth has shed light on an unexpected source of microplastic pollution – the tiny particles that infiltrate both land and sea. In this blog post, we’ll delve into their research and discover how millions of vehicles on British roads might be contributing to this alarming issue.\nIdentifying the Hidden Culprit\nFor the past two decades, dedicated researchers at the University of Plymouth have been on a mission to pinpoint the sources of microplastics in our marine environments. While it’s no secret that many microplastics originate from common items such as plastic bottles, bags, cosmetics, and even clothing fibers, the team stumbled upon a revelation.\nMillions of Tiny Particles: The Tire Connection\nWhat if we told you that every time a vehicle’s wheels turn on British roads, they leave something behind? Marine biologists have uncovered a surprising culprit – vehicle tires. As tires grip the road and brakes are applied, tiny particles of rubber are generated and released into the environment. These particles are so minuscule that they are virtually impossible to see.\nUnseen Pollutants in Our Seas\nTo understand the extent of this issue, scientists have had to develop innovative testing methods. One of their approaches involves sampling sediments from beneath road drains in the estuary, where rainwater washes the particles into waterways. Additionally, they examine what falls out from the atmosphere near roadways and search for tire particles in surface waters. The goal? To measure the prevalence of these tiny rubber fragments in the sea.\nMicroscopic Discoveries\nUnder the microscope, marine biologists find elongated black rubber particles finer than a grain of sand. Advanced chemical tests provide a more accurate estimate of the number of tire particles in our marine environments.\nThe Scale of the Problem\nAccording to Professor Richard Thompson, who leads this research, “We’ve been tracing microplastics in the environment for 30 years, looking at microbeads in cosmetics and fibers from clothing, but the biggest proportion might be from tire particles. It could even make up as much as two-thirds of all microplastics entering the environment.”\nHuman Health Concerns\nWhile the full impact of tire particle pollution on human health is not yet understood, concerns are growing. Researchers are diligently exploring the potential risks and effects.\nPotential Solutions on the Horizon\nSince embarking on this research six years ago, the team has been actively seeking ways to combat this emerging problem. The solutions may lie in a combination of factors, including improved driver behavior, correct tire maintenance, and more effective control of plastic emissions.\nConclusion\n– University of Plymouth marine biologists have spent 20 years researching microplastic pollution in the sea.\n– While known sources of microplastics include plastic bottles, bags, cosmetics, and clothing fibers, they have discovered another source: tire particles from vehicles on British roads.\n– These tire particles are so small that they are virtually invisible but have been found in the marine environment, including sediments under road drains and surface waters.\n– The researchers believe that tire particles could account for a significant portion of all microplastics entering the environment, possibly up to two-thirds.\n– While the impact on human health is not yet fully understood, there are concerns, and efforts to reduce this form of plastic pollution may involve better driver behavior, tire adjustments, and improved plastic emissions control. Professor Richard Thompson is leading this research, which is expected to conclude next year.\nThe University of Plymouth’s pioneering research into microplastic pollution originating from vehicle tires is set to conclude next year. While there’s still much to learn about the effects of these hidden pollutants on both our oceans and human health, this study serves as a crucial reminder of the urgent need for sustainable and environmentally responsible practices in every aspect of our lives. Together, we can work towards reducing the impact of tire particles and safeguarding our precious marine ecosystems.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_eus-embarrassing-climbdown-falklands-sovereignty-confirmed-as-british-2/content_544.html": "EU’s Embarrassing Climbdown: Falklands’ Sovereignty Confirmed as British\nIntroduction:\nIn a recent turn of events, the European Union found itself in an embarrassing climbdown after mistakenly referring to the Falkland Islands as the ‘Islas Malvinas’ and suggesting that the sovereignty of the islands was disputed. This diplomatic misstep sparked immediate criticism from Downing Street and war veterans, leading to a swift clarification from EU officials. Let’s delve into the details of this incident, the implications it carries, and the resounding victory for the Falkland Islanders in asserting their right to self-determination.\nThe EU’s Controversial Remarks:\nThe contentious remarks by the European Union came to light following talks in Brussels with Latin American and Caribbean political leaders. In an official communique released after the EU-CELAC heads of state conference, the EU referred to the Falkland Islands as the ‘Islas Malvinas,’ aligning with Argentina’s longstanding claim over the territory. The statement further called for a ‘peaceful solution of disputes’ surrounding the islands’ sovereignty, causing an uproar among those supporting the British claim.\nRebuke from Downing Street and War Veterans:\nThe remarks from the EU drew sharp criticism from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his official spokesperson. They called it a ‘regrettable choice of words’ and emphasized that the Falkland Islands are unequivocally British. They reiterated that the islanders themselves had chosen this status, and the EU’s position on the matter had not changed. The UK government vowed to continue defending the Falklands’ right to self-determination in international forums and urged the EU to respect the democratic rights of the Falkland Islanders.\nEU’s U-Turn and Clarification:\nFollowing widespread backlash, EU officials issued a clarification, emphasizing that the member states’ views and positions regarding the Falklands/Islas Malvinas had not changed. They asserted that the EU was not in a position to express any official stance on the matter, as there was no council discussion on the issue. This clarification was a crucial victory for the Falkland Islanders, reaffirming the international recognition of their status as a British overseas territory.\nImplications of the Incident:\nThe incident raises concerns about the EU’s handling of delicate geopolitical matters and its potential impact on diplomatic relations with the UK and other nations. Given that the Falkland Islands are no longer an overseas territory of an EU member state after Brexit, the EU’s misstep is seen as a provocative move by some, aimed at undermining the UK’s sovereignty.\nSupport for the Falkland Islands’ Status:\nThe people of the Falkland Islands have demonstrated their overwhelming support for remaining a part of the UK family. In a referendum ten years ago, 99.8% of the islanders voted to maintain their status as a British territory. Furthermore, the UN Charter recognizes their right to self-determination, and the EU’s own 2009 Lisbon Treaty acknowledges the islanders’ right to determine their future. The EU’s initial remarks thus stood in stark contrast to these established principles.\nConclusion:\nIn the wake of the EU’s embarrassing climbdown over the Falkland Islands, it is evident that the international community stands united in recognizing the islanders’ right to self-determination. The swift response from Downing Street and war veterans, coupled with the subsequent clarification from EU officials, highlights the importance of respecting the democratic rights of nations and territories worldwide. The Falkland Islanders can rest assured that their voice has been heard and their status as a British overseas territory remains firmly acknowledged on the international stage.\nComment:\nThis is an insult to the United Kingdom, but even more so, to the gallant soldiers who fought and won, against the odds, back in 1982. I believe that the EU owes them an apology for this pre-meditated act against out nation, which is one of a long list of despicable actions that this arrogant, unaccountable and malicious organisation is responsible for.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_city-watchdog-has-whitewashed-the-debanking-scandal/content_291.html": "City watchdog has whitewashed the debanking scandal\nCity watchdog admits it didn’t examine Farage case in ‘debanking’ review\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a report this week claiming that UK banks and financial institutions did not close customer accounts primarily due to political views between July 2022 and June 2023. However, the review has faced criticism for not including an examination of Nigel Farage’s high-profile case of alleged debanking over his Brexit stance.\nFarage, former leader of the Brexit Party and prominent pro-Leave campaigner, had his bank accounts with Coutts closed earlier this year. Coutts claimed Farage’s political views were contrary to the bank’s values and accused him of being “xenophobic and racist.”\nThe FCA admitted that Farage’s situation was not part of their debanking review, as regulators are looking into it separately. An FCA spokesperson said Farage’s case “fell outside of the reporting period” covered. The review focused on account closures between July 2022 and June 2023. Farage’s Coutts accounts remain open after the bank eventually reversed its decision to close them following public backlash.\nCritics have called the FCA’s report a “whitewash” for overlooking such a prominent alleged case of debanking over political opinions. Farage himself dismissed the review as a “joke” on Twitter, since the debanking concerns stemmed from his high-profile situation in the first place.\nThe FCA said it examined eight cases where “expression of political or any other opinions” were suspected as the reason for account closure. However, regulators concluded this was not the primary reason in any of the cases. Instead, offensive customer behavior, including using racist language against staff, was cited as the main factor leading to debanking.\nWhile claiming no accounts were closed primarily due to political beliefs, the FCA admitted the data was “gathered at speed” and requires further verification. Regulators say additional work is needed to confirm debanking is not occurring over political stances and opinions.\nThe report has fueled the ongoing heated debate regarding access to bank accounts and firms’ risk management policies. It raises questions around whether individuals and organizations should have the right to an account by law, as seen in some other countries.\nFarage’s Case: A Saga of Debanking Allegations\nThe FCA’s debanking review provides an incomplete picture without examining Nigel Farage’s high-profile allegations of having his accounts closed over his Brexit stance. In early 2022, it emerged that Farage had received notice from Coutts that they planned to terminate his bank accounts. Coutts, part of the NatWest Group, is known for serving wealthy clients like the Queen.\nFarage said he was given just 60 days notice and no proper explanation for the bank’s decision. He claims Coutts told him his political affiliations meant he was no longer “aligned with our values.”\nThe situation triggered a crisis at NatWest Group. It emerged the bank’s CEO, Dame Alison Rose, had been the source behind an inaccurate BBC story about Farage’s account closure being for commercial reasons. Rose resigned in July 2022 after admitting she was personally responsible for the misleading story. Coutts CEO Peter Flavel also resigned over the scandal of Farage’s debanking allegations.\nNatWest launched an internal review into the decision to close Farage’s Coutts accounts. In July 2022, Farage said Coutts had reversed course and offered to keep his accounts open. Farage’s case sparked wider concerns that debanking was happening to politically affiliated customers across the sector. It led directly to the FCA’s review of account closures published this week.\nCritics argue that excluding Farage, the most prominent alleged victim of debanking, renders the review futile. Farage called the FCA’s report “a whitewash” on Twitter and reiterated that Coutts clearly told him his political stances drove their decision. With Farage’s case still ongoing as NatWest probes his allegations internally, it fell outside the scope of the FCA’s review timeframe. But campaigners say that overlooking the scandal at the heart of debanking fears makes the watchdog seem oblivious.\nFCA Denies Political Debanking But Admits Data Limitations\nThe FCA stands by its finding that no accounts were closed primarily over political opinions based on data from firms. But it admits there are limitations to the information gathering process. Regulators asked banks, building societies and payments companies to report cases where politics seemed to be a factor in account closures. It received data on 70 situations for further investigation.\nThis found eight cases where expression of political or other opinions was suspected as playing a role. In none of these eight cases did the FCA find any evidence that politics was the main driver behind the closure. Other reasons cited were non-political social media posts, use of racist/offensive language and general anti-social behavior. Customers’ overall conduct was deemed the primary cause of account termination.\nWhile denying politics drove closures, the regulator concedes its findings rely on data that is not fully comprehensive. The information was self-reported by firms “at speed” within a short timescale. The FCA says further work is required to verify the accuracy and completeness of the data provided about account closures. It aims to ensure debanking over political views is not occurring under the radar.\nCritics argue this shows the data is clearly incomplete if the watchdog needs to corroborate it. Farage said the “admission they have conducted a review without investigating any specifics sums it up.”\nAccess to Banking Debates Reignited\nThe FCA’s report has catalyzed fresh debates about access to banking and potential curbs on firms’ account closure powers. Some campaigners and politicians argue individuals and organizations should have a legal right to basic banking services – as seen in France, for example.\nThey say leaving it to banks’ discretion creates situations where lawful political groups or beliefs can be discriminated against through account closures. Others counter that compelling firms to provide accounts against their will seems disproportionate. It could force banks to serve customers or entities that pose legal, regulatory or reputational risks.\nCritics of mandating banking access point to sectors like crypto – where exchanges and startups struggle to open accounts due to perceived money laundering risks. UK regulators are separately reviewing the current “politically exposed persons” (PEP) regime regarding enhanced due diligence on politically affiliated clients.\nCampaigners hope this may provide ways to stop lawful organizations being “debanked” over political associations without proper justification. The debate highlights challenges balancing non-discriminatory access to accounts with letting banks manage risks. There are no easy regulatory solutions, but ignoring alleged cases like Farage’s achieves little.\nFarage and Brexit Allies Cry Foul\nFor Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party allies, the FCA’s report is a whitewash that fails to engage with alleged partisan debanking. Farage said his Coutts case “triggered the crisis, led to resignations and exposed the scandal.” In his view, overlooking it renders the review “a joke.”\nRichard Tice, former Brexit Party chairman, agreed that Farage’s situation “directly led to the FCA even doing this report.” He argued the watchdog’s claim no political debanking occurs is therefore “simply not credible.”\nPro-Brexit groups argue Farage’s case exposed the strength of anti-Brexit bias in the banking sector. They claim the FCA ignoring this case shows establishment prejudice remains strong. However, some suggest Farage and his allies are exploiting his Coutts case to cast themselves as victims. Banks assert Farage’s conduct posed reputational risks beyond his politics.\nDespite Brexit having occurred, Farage and Reform UK continue campaigning against aspects of EU integration in the UK. The FCA report fuels their narrative of battling establishment biases, but offers no evidence of systematic political discrimination in account closures.\nWhat Comes Next in the Debanking Saga?\nThe FCA’s report is unlikely to resolve concerns that lawful political groups could be excluded from banking services without recourse. Nigel Farage’s Coutts case will continue to cast a shadow until fully resolved.\nUK Finance, representing major banks, said the report confirms “there are appropriate controls in place” regarding account closures. But it added that firms recognize the need to protect access for lawful organizations.\nOn Farage’s case specifically, NatWest is continuing to conduct an internal probe into the decisions made regarding his Coutts accounts. Its findings will be pivotal in determining whether politics played an unjustified role.\nRegulators plan to refine their data gathering and analysis methods to provide a clearer view of debanking risks in future. But they stress most closures have valid reasons beyond political factors.\nFor now, the FCA’s report dampens but does not extinguish concerns that lawful political stances could lead to debanking. Farage’s allegations will remain a thorn in the issue unless definitively settled by NatWest’s ongoing investigation.\nThe coming months will determine whether the FCA can provide conclusive assurance that political discrimination is not affecting account access at major UK banks and financial firms.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_disillusioned-tories-moving-to-reform/content_337.html": "Disillusioned ‘True Blue Tories’ Find a New Home: Standing as MPs for Richard Tice’s Reform UK\nIntroduction\nIn a surprising turn of events, a group of disillusioned ‘true blue Tories’ has made the decision to stand as Members of Parliament (MPs) for Richard Tice’s Reform UK. These former Conservative councillors, once staunch supporters of the party, now share their reasons for joining the insurgent Right-of-centre party.\nA Shift in Allegiance: From Conservatives to Reform UK\nDavid White, a 59-year-old councillor from the South Yorkshire market town of Barnsley East, never envisioned supporting any party other than the Conservatives. However, after twenty years as a loyal Conservative member, he made the bold move to join Reform UK at the end of 2022. Mr. White is now gearing up to stand against both the Conservatives and a shadow Labour minister candidate in the upcoming general election.\nConcerns Over the Tories’ Direction\nFormer chairman of his local Conservative association and a prominent figure in the wider South Yorkshire association, Mr. White expressed deep concerns about the direction of the Conservative Party. He cited dissatisfaction with Boris Johnson’s leadership, stating that the ousting of Liz Truss was the final straw. According to Mr. White, the backbiting, infighting, and the handling of leadership transitions left him disillusioned with the Tories.\nReform UK: A Return to Traditional Values\nMr. White, now a member of Reform, believes that the party’s leadership has “other people’s interests at heart” and that Reform represents a return to the Conservative values of the mid-80s. He pointed out the failure of the Tories to address fundamental issues such as the cost of living crisis, illegal immigration, and the housing market, which, he claims, Reform is addressing head-on.\nMigration Concerns and the Appeal of Reform\nCllr Robert Bromley, elected as a Conservative deputy mayor in Surrey in 2021, echoes the sentiment of discontent within the party. Unhappy with the infighting and believing that Rishi Sunak is in the wrong job, Cllr Bromley has joined Reform. One of the key issues attracting former Tories to Reform is the party’s stance on migration. Richard Tice advocates for a “net zero migration” policy, working on a “one in, one out” basis.\nPersonal Motivations: A Former Chairman Turns Candidate\nMark Hoath, Reform’s candidate in Sutton Coldfield, shares a personal motivation for his candidacy. As the former chairman of Andrew Mitchell’s Tory association until 2015, Hoath quit over Brexit and now views his one-time colleague as “acting more like a Lib Dem.” Dissatisfied with the current representation in his town, Hoath has turned to Reform and away from the Tories.\nGrowing Discontent: A Party in Turmoil\nAs discontent grows among parts of the Tory grassroots, the allure of Reform UK is becoming more evident. Despite Reform’s seemingly slim chances of winning seats in the House of Commons, the party is attracting a significant number of former Conservatives, polling as high as 13 per cent nationally. The once-struggling party is now drawing councillors and activists away from their former political home, highlighting the scale of dissatisfaction within the Conservative ranks as the country approaches the next election.",

Nevertheless, that is precisely what he has received.\nDuring those heady days after Joe Biden at long last and belatedly called time and passed the Democratic Party torch to his vice-president, when polling indicated Kamala was poised to sweep all before her, the Labour Party grew rather giddy with enthusiasm and publicly proclaimed it was lending the Democrats assistance.\nWho was bothered if The Orange One took umbrage at the participation of 100 Labour activists and staffers in the presidential election? He was assuredly destined for defeat, and the party would bask in President Harris’s gratitude for the subsequent four years.\nWell, “blast”, as they say in Westminster.\nStarmer might now contemplate that alongside having to tender a grovelling apology to the once and future President Trump for his party’s ill-conceived bout of amateurish virtue signalling, he faces a more pressing predicament in the form of his Foreign Secretary.\nIn his perpetual and unfailing desire to curry favour with whichever audience he addresses, David Lammy once characterised Trump as a “Neo-Nazi sociopath”. This sort of pronouncement might be uttered by someone who (a) is a precocious sixth-former in the school debating society, or (b) harbours no expectation of ever sharing quarters with the target of their criticisms.\nAt present, as Britain’s Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Lammy serves as our principal representative abroad, including to the United States. Not only has he thoughtlessly hurled a foolish insult at the victor of the 2024 presidential election, but in doing so he has essentially accused the American electorate of selecting someone unsuitable for the most significant elected office globally.\nAny arguments that might be advanced in defence of Lammy’s opinion are neither here nor there: our Foreign Secretary must maintain the finest possible relations with our most crucial ally. David Lammy has effectively talked himself out of that position.\nWe cannot permit any foreign power to determine who serves in the UK cabinet and in what capacity. However, dismissing or demoting Lammy at the earliest opportunity would demonstrate to the incoming administration that Starmer is earnest about mending the damage Lammy, through his juvenile language, has inflicted upon the special relationship.\nThis Government may not be particularly keen on post-EU “Global Britain”, but given that during Trump’s previous tenure in the White House, he demonstrated considerably more enthusiasm than either his predecessor or successor for offering us a transatlantic trade deal, Lammy’s sacrifice would represent a modest price for smoothing the path to such a breakthrough.\nBeyond the immediate ramifications for the Government and its Foreign Secretary, Harris’s mortifying defeat at the hands of a man who, in more serious times, genuinely ought never to have come within shouting distance of the White House, should signal a substantial rethink of progressive Left-wing politics across the democratic West. But shall it?\nThe lessons were abundantly present to be absorbed in 2016, when an arrogant, entitled Democratic Party crowned Hillary Clinton as their guaranteed winner in that year’s election. After all, who could possibly fail to triumph against someone as disagreeable as Trump? And yet somehow, Clinton’s contempt for working-class Americans without university degrees and her fixation with transgender rights to utilise women’s lavatories in Oklahoma failed to resonate with the electorate. It remained a genuine conundrum.\nEight years hence, Joe Biden could have chosen to accept the inevitability of his advancing years and permitted his party to select a fresh candidate last year, allowing the victor to be subjected to the customary rigours and scrutiny of the primary process.\nInstead, he rendered it impossible for the party and the country to choose anyone other than Harris, a woman who, upon standing against Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2020, withdrew from the race without securing a single delegate to her party’s national convention.\nIt wasn’t merely the method of her becoming the candidate that irked voters; it was her policy platform. Across America – and indeed, across much of the Western world – the curse of woke is wreaking terrible damage to politics and society.\nGender ideology and critical race theory have their origins in the US, but like any virus, they swiftly traversed the Atlantic. Few viral clips on social media proved more damaging to Harris than the one in which she introduces herself to an audience – from behind a face covering, naturally – as “Kamala Harris, she/her”.\nIt’s not the self-congratulatory smugness that proved irksome; it was the presumption that the cult of the pronoun is now not only obligatory but commonplace. Does she truly not comprehend how strongly ordinary Americans object to such nonsense? Does she not realise that numerous voters associate such language with “taking the knee” and demands by Black Lives Matter protesters to “defund the police”? The entire package is toxic – the language, the smugness and the policies that the White House championed over the past four years to advance the agenda.\nLabour, too, must absorb the lessons of a second Trump victory before they venture too far down the same path. For if British voters elected to follow the example of their American cousins, our own politicians would have every reason for trepidation the next time the ballot boxes are opened.\nThe implications of this electoral outcome stretch far beyond mere personality politics. They signal a profound shift in the Western political landscape, where traditional Left-wing movements find themselves increasingly disconnected from their historical base. The challenge for Labour now lies not merely in managing diplomatic relations with a potentially hostile US administration, but in preventing the same disconnect that has plagued the Democrats from taking root in British soil.\nFor Starmer, the path ahead appears treacherous. He must simultaneously maintain Britain’s crucial alliance with America whilst preserving his party’s progressive credentials – a balancing act that grows more precarious with each passing day. The question remains whether Labour can learn from the Democrats’ missteps or if they, too, shall fall victim to the same political miscalculations that have now twice delivered the White House to Donald Trump.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_britain-crowned-worlds-fourth-largest-exporter-overtaking-japan/content_142.html": "Britain Crowned World’s Fourth Largest Exporter Overtaking Japan\nUK’s Trade Performance Exceeds Expectations\nIn a remarkable feat, Britain has been crowned the world’s fourth largest exporter, surpassing economic powerhouses like France, the Netherlands, and even Japan. The news comes as a pleasant surprise amidst concerns that Brexit could hinder the UK’s international trade. However, the latest figures from the United Nations, the leading authority on trade data, paint a different picture, showcasing the resilience and competitiveness of the British economy on the global stage.\nServices Sector Spearheads Export Growth\nThe UK’s impressive export performance can be largely attributed to the robust growth in its services sector, particularly in areas such as financial services, legal services, insurance, and education. These sectors have established the UK as a world-class economy, punching well above its weight in terms of trade.\nLiam Halligan, GB News’ economics and business editor, shed light on the driving forces behind this export surge. “A big chunk of this increase in exports comes from the fact that the US has been exporting what we call liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to Europe in order to replace Russian gas,” he explained. “America, now the biggest exporter of LNG in the world, just overtook Qatar. Those LNG gas exports come through the UK because we have better LNG docking ports, in Milford Haven in Wales and the Isle of Grain in Kent, than other European nations.”\nRe-exporting US LNG Adds Value\nThe UK’s strategic position and superior infrastructure for handling LNG have allowed it to re-export a significant portion of the US’s LNG exports to Western Europe. This re-exporting process adds value to the UK’s export figures, contributing to its impressive trade performance.\nHowever, Halligan pointed out a concerning aspect of the data. “Total goods exports actually fell 4.4% over the last year,” he said. “That’s the one bit of worrying news in these new statistics. Our goods exports include our manufacturing exports, and we are still a major manufacturer, as I said, but for me, that’s the one blot on the landscape.”\nCompetitiveness Holds the Key to Boosting Goods Exports\nTo boost goods exports and address the decline in this sector, Halligan emphasised the need for improved competitiveness. “Our skills shortage is now pretty serious,” he said. “There are lots of vacancies in the UK economy, even though there are quite a few people out of work, and there’s often what economists call occupational mismatch in those job vacancies.”\nAdditionally, the high cost of energy in the UK has been a significant impediment to the competitiveness of goods exports, particularly in the manufacturing sector. “The price that our manufacturers have been paying for energy has been eye-watering over recent years, and there’s not that much sign that it’s coming down fast,” Halligan noted.\nA Paradoxical Economy\nWhile the UK excels in technical and specialized sectors like financial services, bioscience, and life sciences, Halligan highlighted a paradox in the country’s economic performance. “When it comes to basic things like energy, transport, and housing, we’re like a developing economy upside down,” he remarked.\nDespite the challenges, the UK’s export figures have remained robust, with exports to the European Union reaching record levels, partly due to the re-exporting of US energy and the continued demand for British services within the bloc.\nThe Fracking Debate and Energy Security\nOne of the most contentious issues surrounding the UK’s energy competitiveness is the debate over fracking, the process of extracting shale gas from underground rock formations. Halligan expressed frustration that one of the reasons for the UK’s high exports is the re-exporting of American liquefied natural gas, which was obtained through fracking – a practice that has remained banned in the UK for the past decade.\n“Imagine if we’d have been using our own natural gas and exporting that,” he pondered. “How much higher could we be? Third in the world, perhaps?”\nThe fracking debate has reignited discussions around energy security and self-sufficiency, with proponents arguing that it could reduce the UK’s reliance on imported energy and potentially lower costs for consumers and businesses.\nConclusion: A Resilient Economy with Room for Improvement\nDespite the challenges posed by Brexit and the global economic landscape, the UK has demonstrated remarkable resilience and competitiveness in its export performance. The country’s prowess in services sectors, coupled with its strategic position and infrastructure for re-exporting US LNG, has propelled it to the rank of the world’s fourth largest exporter.\nHowever, to maintain and build upon this success, the UK must address key issues such as skills shortages, energy costs, and competitiveness in the goods and manufacturing sectors. By tackling these challenges head-on, the UK can unlock its full potential and further solidify its position as a global economic powerhouse.\nAs the world continues to grapple with economic uncertainties and shifting trade dynamics, the UK’s ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial in navigating these turbulent waters and securing a prosperous future for its export-driven economy.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-the-migration-crisis-will-never-end/content_266.html": "Why the migration crisis will never end\n163 countries have adopted the UN global compact on migration, a non-binding treaty that outlines standards on safe, orderly and regular migration. 30 countries refused to commit to the same goals, amid growing criticism that the agreement could threaten the sovereignty of nations, when it comes to immigration.\nSome people have criticised it on the basis that it could make any form of opposition to migration, a criminal offence. Although this may not be the case, as it is not actually a treaty, it does send out a message that migration is normal and will continue, for as long as people wish to migrate.\nThis document also sends out a message to courts around the western world, that immigration is normal, it is not an offence and therefore, putting pressure on the courts to find in favour of migrants, when their case is pleaded by left wing legal representation, which supports uncontrolled immigration.\nThis agenda on immigration was introduced quietly and without any consultation with citizens of the countries that would be most affected by the UN compact. The UN have never made themselves available to answer questions about their agenda, unless it was a staged news release, presented as a press conference.\nEurope along with Scandinavian and Canada are the nations most likely to bear the brunt of continued migration, even though they are already at breaking point, with leaders doing going to extraordinary lengths to deceive their citizens, about the true numbers. They not only exclude the dependants from the figures, preferring to base figures on the head of the household (strange how liberal left champions do not expose this as sexist) but they also pay millions of our taxes to keep these migrants in conditions that many indigenous citizens would only dream of.\nThousands and thousands live in smart hotels, all expenses paid, even their mobiles. They were even treated to an outing to a first division football club, as part of their integration, yet nothing seems to be done about their lewd and immoral behaviour towards women, that is not acceptable in the west.\nThe UK is a member of the ECHR which prevents any efficient process for deporting these people and no major member of government has expressed any possibility of us leaving, why would that be? Is our legal system so poor, that we need to look to the ECHR to keep it in check? No! Is there any benefit to the UK to remain in the ECHR? No! The reality is, that all those in power, support this globalist agenda, which does not bear thinking about.\nThe population in the third world with a motive to migrate is in the BILLIONS, how many can we cope with, or more worryingly, how long will it be before the entire culture of Europe will be gone for ever?\nDespite the virtue signalling, the figures suggest that racism in the UK is rife, greater than ever, with ethnic minorities feeling more hostility than ever before. People may not dare to speak up, but that does not mean that they do not feel threatened, angry and deeply offended that they are now second class citizens in their own country.\nUnfortunately, there is an army of self-loathing left wing anarchists in the schools and universities of the UK, who are not educating, they are indoctrinating, casting aspersions and hate on all that is great about our country.\nNobody should feel threatened, nobody should be victimised because of the ethnic background, but this continued agenda to over-represent minorities in every walk in life has backfired, because the silent majority have never felt as threatened as they do today.\nThere comes a time when the reality will stare us in the face, what will be left of our Great Britain when that day comes?\nRead the full compact on immigration HERE",

Homelessness is increasing dramatically and in this day and age, no matter what anyone has done, no matter what their individual circumstances may be, NOBODY should have no other option but to sleep on the streets.\nThroughout Northamptonshire, let alone the rest of the country, there are so many empty buildings, so many empty industrial units, though not ideal, anything is better than sleeping rough. I am not suggesting yet another charity, I want action, I want to see legislation or moral pressure, for the owners of these units to make them available to become emergency night shelters.\nI have no doubt, that should this happen, the generosity of the British public will ensure that there will be bedding, a change of clothes, shower facilities and food made available for the homeless. I would also like to see people volunteer to counsel, support and guide these people to help them to re-build their lives.\nThis is a moral responsibility that is incumbent upon all of us, or should be, because many of us are closer to homelessness than we may realise.\nIt only needs a gentle push from the government or local authorities to encourage the landlords of these units, who are frequently pension funds, who really do not care less about the property, but these units could be life-savers to those with nowhere to go.\nI have recently acquired the Northants Post, not only for business reasons, but to enable me to give exposure to issues such as this at a local level and I intend to take to the streets with my camera to document what is happening. I would be very grateful if a local videographer would offer some time to help me create documentary videos to create awareness and increase pressure for something to be done about this.\nIf you would like to help or otherwise get involved, please contact me directly.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-west-will-soon-pay-for-bidens-betrayal/content_1041.html": "The West will soon pay for Biden’s betrayal\nThe US President’s stubbornness is signalling to terrorists that barbarism will be rewarded\nOur global adversaries – China, Russia, Iran and its proxies – must be marvelling at their good fortune as President Joe Biden effectively endorses a terrorist veto over Israel’s right to self-defence.\nThe President’s unprecedented open threat to withhold arms deliveries to Israel “if they go into Rafah”, and a State Department public report on Israeli conduct of the war, are self-inflicted wounds to a vital alliance. Israel has not yet publicly responded, but it faces critical choices over whether to proceed militarily in Rafah, or back down. Neither option is attractive given the potential consequences.\nBiden’s stubbornness is wrong on many levels. First, close allies should always engage privately during wartime. Leaks undoubtedly occur, often intentionally, but preserving even minimal confidentiality is essential to later repairing damage done both at governmental and personal levels.\nPiling on publicly in the middle of a war is imprudent, even juvenile, damaging the respect and trust allies must sustain during times of crisis and tension. The propaganda opportunities handed to hostile powers are immeasurable. And if Biden is prepared to cast loose one of America’s most valued partners, what does that foretell for those more distant, less favoured than Israel? How does Ukraine feel? Or Taiwan?\nSecond, Biden’s motives are not so high-minded as he may have us believe. This is no profile in courage. Domestically, the President is faring poorly in polls against Donald Trump, and defections to minor-party candidates could sink his re-election chances. In swing-state primaries like Michigan, large numbers of Democrats voted “uncommitted”, posing significant risks if they stay home in November. White House staffers have castigated themselves to regain key Democratic blocs but they have so far failed. Elizabeth Warren, asserting Israel may be liable for “genocide” in Gaza, exemplifies the problem.\nIronically, while politics dominates Biden’s calculations, his gambit may backfire. Republicans uniformly rejected his approach, as did significant numbers of Democrats. Biden’s threat reflects weakness, coming just weeks after his frantic efforts to pressure Israel not to retaliate strongly after Iran’s missile-and-drone attack.\nThe President’s supporters invoke Ronald Reagan’s withholding weapons when Israel struck Palestinians in Lebanon, but the two scenarios are entirely distinct. The US-Israel relation at that time was moral and historical, not strategic, as it is today. Indeed, Reagan later forged the Washington-Jerusalem strategic ties. Biden repeatedly pledged “ironclad support” for Israel after October 7, but subsequently swerved dramatically from that position.\nFinally, and most importantly, the substance of Biden’s threat and the thoroughly unsatisfactory State Department report expose the administration as misguided and confused in ways that could haunt future US presidents.\nClose-quarters combat in complex urban environments, let alone in Hamas’s extraordinary network of underground tunnels, is something Western militaries prefer to avoid. Not surprisingly, the State’s report is incoherent and contradictory, doubtless reflecting anti-Israel sentiment in many department bureaux, and schizophrenia within the Biden Administration’s political ranks. The report lacks specificity, yet incomplete information is hard to assess without adequate context – which is why a fair and accurate reckoning would be most fruitful after the war, not while combat still rages.\nThe fact that civilians are present in combat areas requires that Israel, or any combatant, determine they are striking only military targets and that civilian casualties are no more than proportional to the importance of such targets. In Rafah, the IDF is seeking to eliminate Hamas’s highest command-and-control hierarchies and its remaining organised military units, all clearly legitimate objectives.\nIt is unacceptable that Israel may be prevented from achieving its legitimate self-defence goals because the terrorists are so barbaric as to sacrifice their own civilian population to save themselves. If that is what Biden means by saying he objects to Israel entering Rafah, then he is simply endorsing the terrorist veto. Yet it is Hamas that is morally culpable for Gazan civilian deaths, not Israel.\nWe do not know what will unfold next, but the decisive choice now lies with Israel’s war cabinet. Biden’s ill-considered threat to cut the Jewish state loose will be at the centre of considerable debate. There is no debate, however, that Biden’s ploy will come back to haunt him, America, and all the West.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_its-time-to-bring-back-conscription/content_387.html": "It’s time to bring back Conscription\nA Heated Debate\nA fiery debate has broken out in the UK over whether some form of national service should be reintroduced to address concerns over Britain’s declining military power. A new report has found that British armed forces now have 50,000 fewer personnel than France, raising alarms that the UK can no longer defend its interests on two fronts simultaneously.\nIn a YouTube discussion on the issue, strong arguments were made on both sides by prominent military figures. Supporters of national service pointed to its potential benefits for national unity, reducing youth problems, and filling recruitment gaps. Opponents argued it would be an expensive distraction that fails to address the core issues weakening UK defence capabilities in an age of new threats.\nDiminishing Forces, Increasing Threats\nThe report making headlines was published by the renowned International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). It warned bluntly that British combat forces are now “very, very small” relative to the country’s global commitments and security challenges.\nThis follows a pattern of decline spanning decades. Despite warnings from now sidelined senior officers, successive UK governments have pressed ahead with force reductions while empowering civil servants to lead defence policymaking over uniformed commanders. As military historian Lieutenant General Jonathan Riley contends, the Ministry of Defence “has been disemboweled as a strategic military headquarters.”\nThe result, argue critics, are armed forces that look impressive on paper but lack the actual strength, readiness and advanced technologies to defend British interests against threats old and new – from open warfare to hybrid attacks. Ascendant rivals like China and Russia are already probing the UK’s weaknesses from cyberspace to the seas.\nCould National Service Help?\nProponents argue some form of national service – be it military or civilian – could benefits society and defence in these times of transition.\nThe need is evident in a wave of nihilism, disillusionment and anti-patriotic sentiment amongst many British youths. By providing structure, skills and public service opportunities, national service could help recent graduates gain purpose and perspective before entering the workforce or academia.\nResearch shows that positive youth participation in community protection roles like firefighting promotes psychosocial wellbeing. National service graduates could directly boost the part-time volunteer forces that are increasingly critical to UK resilience while creating a population morepsychologically invested in national security.\nThese second-order benefits matter amidst recruitment and retention challenges facing Britain’s struggling armed forces. If creatively tailored, national service initiatives could steer graduates towards fillings gaps areas like cybersecurity. However, making regular service life more appealing remains paramount.\nMisplaced Nostalgia?\nCritics counter that calling for national service reflects misplaced nostalgia more than defence strategy. Conscription-based mass mobilisation belongs to the 20th century warfare, not the technology-centric conflicts unfolding today against threats like domestic extremism and hybrid disinformation.\nLarge-scale national service would require tremendous investment against questionable returns. Just look at Russia’s floundering conscript forces today, ossified by ageing Soviet-era weapons and tactics against Ukraine’s nationalist volunteer defenders equipped with NATO’s latest kit. Quality matters more than quantity in modern warfare.\nThus the focus should be on expanding and empowering Britain’s existing volunteer reserves and cadets to gain military experience without abandoning civilian careers or education. These part-time forces maintain closer community ties and often bring specialist skillsets complementing the overstretched regulars. Beefing these up would build resilience through wider societal participation.\nBrexit & The Franco Challenge\nHowever, political considerations inevitably shape this debate. Brexit has revived old rivalries as the UK reassesses its place in Europe and the world. Reports of French military advances have stoked nationalist concerns that “the French are laughing at us” across the Channel.\nYet while inter-service rivalry has long driven reform, overstating current Franco-British differences risks breeding complacency. In actuality, both nations field modern, competent forces within an intimate alliance. Meeting the challenge from Paris should focus less on score-counting than encouraging joint NATO leadership to address threats Brussels was unwilling to prioritize before Brexit – like maritime security against Russian expansionism in the High North.\nMoving Beyond Wokery\nUltimately, getting Britain’s hard power back on track requires moving beyond partisan politics – and Twitter-amplified outrage narratives – to enact structural defence reforms. As General Riley stresses, steady underinvestment in frontline capabilities while squandering billions on botched procurement projects has left forces demoralized.\nBoth equipment and training budgets have suffered from the political drive to fund expanded welfare programmes since 2008. Effectiveness now depends on making service life financially and socially rewarding to attract committed talent. This includes championing veterans in public life to demonstrate the value of military service to society against corrosive ‘woke’ messaging denigrating UK history.\nConclusion\nThe national service debate reflects rising insecurity over Britain’s place in the world amidst perceived declining military power. While reintroducing national service could bring some societal benefits, it risks distraction from the hard choices needed to rebuild capable armed forces for the 21st century. The UK needs to invest more – and more wisely – in defence while celebrating its proud martial traditions to motivate the next generation. Brexit has granted freedom to rethink UK strategy; now the country must match rhetoric with the required resources and reforms.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cyprus-44-years-of-division/content_1096.html": "Cypriots woke up Friday to the sound of sirens, marking the 44th anniversary since Turkish invasion. The invasion of Cyprus came only five days after the coup engineered by the military junta, then ruling Greece, that toppled the democratically-elected president of Cyprus, the late Archbishop Makarios III.\nAir-raid sirens sounded at 0530 local time (0230 GMT) when the Turkish invasion was launched and Turkish troops landed on the island`s northern shores. Thousands of dead, hundreds of missing, 200,000 became refugees as they fled the advancing Turkish troops.\nOn Friday morning, a memorial service for army officers and soldiers killed during the invasion will take place at Makedonitissa Tomb in Nicosia, in the presence of President Nicos Anastasiades. An aircraft, similar to Noratlas transport plane which was shot down by friendly fire during the 1974 Turkish invasion, will be unveiled. All but one on board Noratlas aircraft, Greek commandos and crew, were killed during operation NIKI 4, in the early hours of Monday, July 22, 1974.\nA formal service will be held at Phaneromeni Church in the old part of Nicosia, to be attended by the president and the political leadership. A series of other anti-occupation events will also take place during the day. In the evening an event will take place at the presidential palace to mark and condemn both the coup and the Turkish invasion. Anastasiades will be the keynote speaker.\nPolitical parties and various associations and organised groups have issued statements, condemning the Turkish invasion and the continuing occupation and reiterating their determination to fight for a just and viable solution. So here we are, 44 years later, Cyprus is STILL divided, with both sides approaching the division like a political game of Chess.\nA good starting point would be for both sides to acknowledge far more about the events that led up to the division and to approach the future with the mindset that it is the right of ALL Cypriots to live freely in a united Island. As it is, both sides insist on clinging to their spiritual ‘motherlands’ rather than aim for one island, one citizenship, one national identity and one flag.\nCyprus is not made up of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, ( I actually despise those definitions, which by their very nature are and were always intended to be, divisive) Cyprus has a diverse population from Maronites, Armenians, Russians, Romanians to name a few. Cyprus is also a full member of the EU, which does mean that it is no longer an Island state, it is little more than province of Europe and therefore, continued division and rhetoric about ethnicity is at the very least, obtuse.\nIt is time for ALL the citizens of Cyprus to acknowledge that they are Cypriots and now Europeans, in a rapidly changing demographic society where Europe is merging in to one super state. People should not be held to ransom by the past or by outside forces.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-paradox-of-democracy-and-individualism/content_322.html": "The Paradox of Democracy and Individualism\nIntroduction\nDemocracy and individualism are two fundamental concepts in our modern society, but have you ever considered the paradox that exists between them? In this thought-provoking discussion, we’ll delve into the idea that the presentation of political ideologies as linear spectrums may be a form of trickery that distracts us from a more complex reality. Drawing inspiration from Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World,” we’ll explore how control over the masses can be achieved through subtle manipulation and the consequences of overlooking the nuances of political influence.\nThe Illusion of Linearity\nOften, when we engage with matters of social structure or politics, we’re presented with a seemingly straightforward dichotomy: left-wing vs. right-wing, collectivism vs. individualism, socialism vs. capitalism, and the list goes on. However, it’s worth considering whether this binary presentation truly encapsulates the intricate dynamics at play in our political landscape.\nOverlapping Circles of Influence\nOne compelling perspective suggests that political structures are more akin to overlapping circles than distinct lines. These circles of influence move like positively charged ions, and the one with the most energy and force holds the greatest sway over us. This view challenges the conventional notion of political extremes and invites us to examine the subtler interactions between these circles.\nAldous Huxley’s Warning\nAldous Huxley, in his seminal work “Brave New World,” explored the concept of controlling society through indulgence and desensitization. He argued that when people are pushed beyond a certain limit, they become a potent force, posing a grave threat to oppressive regimes. History bears witness to such uprisings, from Boudicca and Spartacus to the Zanji Rebellion and the Bolsheviks.\nThe Overdose on Desires\nHuxley’s warning takes a different turn when he suggests that allowing people to overdose on their desires, essentially desensitizing themselves, can be equally destructive to society. In this scenario, society becomes easily manipulable, and this idea of indulgence and desensitization precedes the more overt forms of totalitarianism.\nEngineered Social Chaos\nAs we strive for law and order, we often overlook the engineered social chaos taking place behind the scenes. A new generation of individuals, inflamed with entitlement, disrupts our cities, creating the illusion of a descent into social chaos and lawlessness.\nTotalitarianism in the Free World\nParadoxically, amid this perceived chaos, we find ourselves living in what may be described as the most totalitarian times in the Free World. This serves as another example of manipulation on a grand scale. The pattern of creating a problem, generating fear, and offering a solution is a recurring theme.\nThe Call for True Democracy\nIn this critical analysis, it becomes evident that we are denied the purity of democracy. No one person can be entrusted with absolute power, for that goes against the very nature of humanity. Those in positions of power should be held accountable to the masses, the true custodians of a functioning democracy.\nThe Need for Accountability\nRecent events demonstrate a disturbing trend where leaders are removed without the mandate of the people. The distinction between voting for a candidate and voting for a prime minister becomes blurred, raising questions about the legitimacy of these actions.\nProtecting Society\nTo shield society from the encroaching authoritarianism, it is imperative to demand genuine democracy. MPs and local candidates must answer directly to the people, and the public, in turn, must hold them accountable. Superficial gestures should not placate a vigilant populace.\nConclusion\nThe paradox between democracy and individualism is not a simple one, and it extends beyond the surface-level divisions presented to us. To preserve the essence of democracy and safeguard society from manipulation and authoritarianism, it is our collective responsibility to scrutinize, question, and actively participate in the political processes that shape our lives. By doing so, we can strive for a world where true democracy prevails, and the voice of the people remains the ultimate source of power.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_trumps-strong-arm-deportations-succeeding/content_329.html": "Trump’s strong-arm deportations succeeding\nTrump’s Strong-arm Diplomacy Demonstrates to Britain and the World How to Handle Migrant Deportations\nThe Colombian president’s dramatic reversal, moving from denouncing Donald Trump as a “white enslaver” to offering his personal aircraft, took place in less than nine hours, demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of America’s diplomatic pressure tactics.\nOn that fateful Sunday afternoon, Gustavo Petro initially took a defiant stance, refusing to accept two planned deportation flights from the United States, citing what he termed a lack of “dignity” in the proceedings. At first, it appeared Mr Petro was wagering that Mr Trump would adhere to the customary diplomatic protocols typically observed between the United States and one of its principal Latin American allies.\n“I do not shake the hands of white enslavers,” Mr Petro declared with evident disdain.\nHowever, Mr Trump’s swift and stark response prompted an astonishing about-face: should Mr Petro maintain his resistance, the former president warned, the United States would implement a punitive 25 per cent tariff on all Colombian imports, escalating to a crushing 50 per cent after merely a week.\nIn a particularly pointed move, Colombian government officials would find their visas revoked – and in an unprecedented extension of the ban to “associates”, any offspring enrolled in American universities might suddenly discover their academic pursuits unceremoniously terminated.\nSuch measures hardly reflect the traditional treatment of a friendly nation, particularly one that serves as America’s foremost ally in the regional struggle against drug cartels. Nevertheless, the aggressive strategy proved remarkably effective. By Monday morning, Mr Petro’s office had capitulated, announcing the presidential aircraft would be made available to repatriate deportees, thereby enabling the deportation flights to proceed as initially scheduled.\nWhilst the United States suspended the threatened tariffs, it maintained a firm stance, declaring the visa restrictions would remain in place until the aircraft had successfully landed.\nFor Mr Trump, the diplomatic exchange could scarcely have unfolded more favourably, serving as a crystalline demonstration to the international community of how an adversary can be thoroughly overwhelmed through the strategic deployment of White House authority. The victory proved particularly potent given that the vanquished party was a self-proclaimed “socialist” who had built his reputation through guerrilla warfare.\nThe message radiating from America is unambiguous: the nation is prepared to employ ruthless tactics when necessary.\nThis diplomatic confrontation has been monitored with particular interest by two other smaller nations currently engaged in disputes with Mr Trump: Greenland and Panama.\nEven if the president refrains from acting upon his somewhat cavalier threats to invade these territories, which occupy the periphery of America’s direct geographical sphere of influence, he might achieve his objectives through intimidation alone.\nDenmark has already committed £1.2 billion to bolstering Greenland’s defences, including plans for additional patrol vessels and enhanced drone surveillance to counter potential infiltration by Russia or China.\nJosé Raúl Mulino, Panama’s president, whilst steadfast in his refusal to surrender control of the strategically crucial 82-kilometre canal connecting the Caribbean to the Pacific, faces a delicate diplomatic challenge. Whilst regulatory requirements regarding neutrality preclude him from reducing transit costs for American cargo vessels, Panama would be ill-advised to permit China any further influence in the region. Mr Trump’s ire has been particularly provoked by the presence of two ports under Hong Kong-based management at opposite ends of the waterway.\nOne potential compromise might involve offering America preferential investment opportunities in the canal’s operations, potentially encouraging Mr Trump to direct his attention elsewhere.\nNaturally, the president’s effective use of diplomatic pressure has attracted admiring glances abroad, particularly in Britain, which remains entangled in its seemingly interminable struggle to deport illegal migrants and failed asylum-seekers.\nThe question arises: Could Sir Keir Starmer shed his lawyer’s demeanour and employ similar strong-arm tactics to achieve success in this arena?\nThe stark reality is that Britain’s position differs markedly from America’s. Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom has relatively few nations dependent upon its goodwill for economic prosperity. Its top ten trading partners include China, Switzerland, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia – nations whose citizens are not seeking refuge in the UK and who would remain largely unmoved by any attempts at diplomatic intimidation from Downing Street.\nThose countries whose citizens do illegally traverse the Channel, such as Bangladesh and Iran, maintain minimal trade relations with the UK. Britain lacks the leverage to compel France, backed by the European Union, to accept the return of Channel migrants.\nThe attempt to resolve the issue through financial incentives to Rwanda has thus far proved fruitless. If Trump’s America represents the heavyweight champion of international influence, Britain must acknowledge its current status as more akin to a welterweight contender.\nNevertheless, Sir Keir might still demonstrate some diplomatic muscle in alternative ways.\nJens Spahn, a prominent figure in Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) – likely to form the next government – recently broached the possibility of Berlin withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), citing the obstacles it presents to deporting foreign criminals.\n“It is not ordained by God that we maintain our membership,” he observed. “While we remain committed multilateralists, there must be tangible benefits to such arrangements.”\nSir Keir has firmly pledged not to withdraw the UK from the treaty, as Britain’s pursuit of enhanced trade terms with the EU partially depends upon shared membership. However, the Prime Minister could potentially forge an alliance for reform alongside Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and other nations advocating for more decisive measures to address illegal migration.\nFurthermore, Britain retains significant influence in certain quarters – namely, its overseas territories. The possibility of establishing an offshore processing centre for asylum seekers in the Falkland Islands, as recently proposed by the Policy Exchange think tank, represents one such avenue for consideration.\nOne can only imagine that if Mr Trump occupied Number 10, the next phase of this diplomatic strategy would already be well underway…",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_counter-terrorism-and-human-rights/content_815.html": "Counter-terrorism and human rights\nWhy is counter-terrorism a human rights issue?\nBoth terrorism and counter-terrorism are human rights issues.\nTerrorism is a human rights issue because it involves deliberate attacks on civilians causing death and serious injury – and so engages the right to life and the right to physical integrity.\nCounter-terrorism is a human rights issue because the way that the state responds to the threat of terrorism may involve exceptional measures that depart from long-established legal principles, including fundamental rights.\nWhat is terrorism?\nThere is no established definition of terrorism under international law. Instead, there is a great deal of debate over which actions are terrorist and which are acts of legitimate resistance against oppressive governments. Regardless of the failure to agree on a broader definition, there is an overwhelming consensus that terrorism involves the use of threat of violence against civilians for a political purpose.\nIn the UK, the legal definition of terrorism is provided in section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This defines terrorism as the use or threat of action which:\n- involves serious violence against a person\n- involves serious damage to property\n- endangers a person’s life\n- creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public; or\n- is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system\nIn circumstances where:\n- the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public; and\n- the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause.\nThe purpose of the definition in section 1 is not to define a crime of terrorism – virtually any terrorist offence is already a violation of existing criminal law, such as incitement, conspiracy to cause explosions or murder. Instead, section 1 acts as a trigger for the use of other counter-terrorism measures. For example, membership of a proscribed terrorist organisation is a criminal offence under section 11 of the Terrorism Act 2000.\nWhat is the main counter-terrorism legislation in the UK?\nThere are now four main pieces of counter-terrorism legislation: the Terrorism Act 2000, the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, and the Terrorism Act 2006. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 is also relevant to the debate over counter-terrorism powers in the UK.\nThe Terrorism Act 2000 continues to provide the main framework for counter-terrorism powers in the UK. It contains the main powers for arrest and extended pre-charge detention in terrorism cases as well as the main terrorism offences outside the ordinary criminal law, for example, membership of and support for a proscribed organisation. Ironically it was intended to be a single, comprehensive piece of counter-terrorism legislation intended to replace the patchwork of temporary legislation that had arisen over 30 years of the Northern Ireland conflict.\nEach of the subsequent Acts has been a response to a particular event – 9/11, the Belmarsh judgment in December 2004, and the 7/7 attacks.\nWhat was the government’s response to 9/11?\nIn December 2001, Parliament passed the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCSA), Part 4 of which allowed the Home Secretary to order the indefinite detention of foreign terrorist suspects who could not be deported on the grounds that they faced a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR. In order to do this, the government derogated from Article 5 under the ECHR.\nIn addition, the only right of appeal for those detained under Part 4 was by way of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), established by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 following the Chahal judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.(([1996] ECHR 54)) Due to the use of sensitive intelligence materials (such as evidence from covert surveillance), the evidence against detainees was partly open (which the detainee would view and which his or her lawyers would be able to challenge), and partly closed (which the detainee and his lawyers would be prohibited from seeing). Instead of being able to challenge the closed evidence, the detainee would be represented by a special advocate who would argue the case on his behalf in the closed proceedings but would not be allowed to communicate with the detainee.\nDespite major criticisms of Part 4 from the Newton Committee of Privy Counsellors, appointed to review ATCSA in 2003, the regime of indefinite detention was not ended until the House of Lords’ judgment in the Belmarsh case in December 2004 found that it was incompatible with Articles 5 and 14 ECHR.\nWhat are control orders?\nControl orders were the government’s response to the House of Lords ruling in the Belmarsh case, brought about under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. The 2005 Act allows the Home Secretary to impose control orders on individuals whom he suspects of being involved in terrorism. Unlike indefinite detention, they may be imposed on both UK nationals and foreign nationals, something which allowed the government to lift its derogation under the ECHR. As with indefinite detention, however, any appeal against control orders may involve the use of closed proceedings and special advocates, meaning that someone wishing to challenge a control order may not know all (or any) of the evidence against them.\nControl orders may impose a variety of conditions including restrictions on employment, residence, travel, communication and association with others. There are two types of orders: derogating and non-derogating. Derogating orders allow the Home Secretary to impose house arrest, but can only be made in the event that the government derogates once more from the ECHR. Non-derogating orders do not allow the imposition of house arrest but can still involve very sweeping restrictions on personal freedom.\nIn April 2006, Mr Justice Sullivan made a declaration of incompatibility against the 2005 Act on the basis that the low level of judicial review control order proceedings and the use of closed proceedings violated the right to a fair trial under Article 6 ECHR. In June 2006, the same judge struck down six control orders on the basis that the Home Secretary had no power to impose 18 hour curfews without a derogation from Article 5 ECHR. In August 2006, the Court of Appeal upheld Mr Justice Sullivan’s ruling on Article 5 but reversed it in relation to Article 6 (see casenote below).\nWhat was the government’s response to 7/7?\nThe control order system was in place for only a short time when London was struck by terrorist attacks on 7 July 2005. Following the London bombings, the Prime Minister signalled the introduction of further counter-terrorism legislation, as well as a number of non-statutory measures. The key features of the statutory measures was the criminalisation of statements ‘encouraging’ or ‘glorifying’ the commission of acts of terrorism, and the proposed extension of the maximum period for pre-charge detention following arrest in terrorism cases from 14 days to 90 days.\nThe key feature of the non-statutory measures has been a renewed emphasis on deportation of foreign nationals as a counter-terrorism measure. This includes the seeking of diplomatic assurances against Article 3 ECHR ill-treatment and the UK government’s intervention in Ramzy v The Netherlands to argue that the prohibition against non-refoulement in cases involving national security is not absolute.\nAlthough the 90 days proposal was defeated, the Terrorism Act 2006 now extends the maximum period of pre-charge detention to 28 days. In addition, it is now a criminal offence for a person to publish statements that encourage, either intentionally or recklessly, the commission of terrorist acts. This includes reference to statements which ‘glorify’ acts of terrorism.\nSummary\n– Terrorism and counter-terrorism both raise human rights issues. Terrorism violates rights like the right to life, while counter-terrorism measures may restrict rights and liberties.\n– There is no agreed international definition of terrorism, but it generally refers to violence against civilians for political ends. The UK has a legal definition in the Terrorism Act 2000.\n– Key UK counter-terrorism laws include the Terrorism Act 2000, the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, and the Terrorism Act 2006. Each was passed in response to events like 9/11 and the London bombings.\n– Measures introduced include: indefinite detention without trial of foreign terror suspects (2001 Act), control orders to restrict liberty (2005 Act), extended pre-charge detention (2006 Act), glorification of terrorism made a crime (2006 Act).\n– These measures have faced challenges, like indefinite detention ruled unlawful by the House of Lords in 2004. Control orders have also been controversial and subject to legal challenges.\n– There are tensions between security and liberty in countering terrorism. Measures like extended detention before charge or control orders are seen by some as excessive restrictions on human rights.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_priti-patel-the-straight-talker-on-tax-cuts-migration-and-mp-security/content_120.html": "Priti Patel – The Straight Talker on Tax Cuts, Migration, and MP Security\nKeeping Expectations in Check\nIn a recent interview, former Home Secretary Priti Patel offered her insights into the upcoming budget, stating that downplaying expectations is part of the process, primarily due to market-sensitive information involved. She expressed hope for potential surprises despite the gloom and doom in the newspapers, reiterating her consistent belief that the British people deserve more of their own money.\nThe Tax Burden Dilemma\nPatel highlighted the highest tax burden in over 70 years, questioning why the public’s money is not being spent effectively on essential services like schools and hospitals. She acknowledged that higher public spending necessitates higher taxes, a choice every government must make. Recalling her time in the 2010-2015 government, Patel cited her role in reducing the welfare budget by £12 billion, a drop in the ocean compared to current welfare spending.\nCutting the Civil Service Size\nPatel supported Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s plan to reduce the size of the Civil Service, which currently stands at over 500,000 employees – a record high. She pointed out that shaving a degree off this figure could save at least £1 billion in public expenditure, referencing the cost savings achieved when the Civil Service stood at around 400,000 employees during her tenure from 2010 to 2016.\nThe Need for Economic Growth\nEmphasising the importance of economic growth, Patel expressed frustration at the lack of ideas presented in the media. She commended the government’s £360 million boost to British manufacturing R&D but stressed the need to assess its impact on job creation, tax base growth, and levelling up across the country.\nPositioning for the Future?\nAmidst speculation about her political ambitions, Patel firmly stated her desire for the Conservatives to win the next election under Rishi Sunak’s leadership, dismissing any talk of a leadership bid. She expressed her commitment to supporting her colleagues and helping the party succeed at the national level.\nThe Migration Crisis\nPatel expressed disappointment over the ongoing migration crisis, citing the recent tragedy in the Channel. She criticised the government for abandoning her “New Plan for Immigration” and the Rwanda policy, which included building reception centres and implementing a “One-Stop Shop” to prevent repeated appeals by asylum seekers.\nThe Undisclosed Reality\nPatel highlighted the public’s lack of awareness regarding the true extent of the migration crisis, citing the example of 17 hotels in Belfast being commandeered for migrants. She emphasised the open doors around the country, making it impossible to address the housing situation and build the required social housing with the current influx of people.\nReforming Border Force\nPatel criticised the damning reports on the Home Office’s border operations, emphasising the need for operational reforms, high standards, and professional and diligent border officers. She expressed regret that her proposal to reform Border Force was scrapped after her departure.\nThe Rwanda Policy\nWhile acknowledging the complexity of the migration issue, Patel maintained her support for the Rwanda policy, asserting that the government does not need additional legislation to overrule Rule 39 and commence deportations. She highlighted Rwanda’s capability to host over 100,000 migrants and urged the government to start operational planning for flights to the country.\nMP Security Concerns\nAddressing the issue of MP security, Patel acknowledged the increasing threats and hatred in politics, attributing much of it to social media and “keyboard warriors.” She revealed three attempted assaults on her in the past year and commended Speaker Lindsay Hoyle’s efforts to enhance MP security. Patel expressed concern about MPs’ reluctance to speak freely in Parliament due to fears for their families’ safety.\nAs a straight talker known for her direct approach, Priti Patel’s candid remarks shed light on pressing issues facing the UK, ranging from economic challenges and migration to the safety of elected officials. Her unwavering stance on implementing tough measures and her criticism of the current government’s handling of these matters have reignited discussions around the country’s future course.\nIs Priti Patel preparing for a leadership bid?\nPriti Patel has suddenly broke silence and has been very vocal about the Conservative party, yet while she expressed strong support for the Prime Minister, she refused to rule out a leadership bid. Despite the rhetoric, she was home secretary for 3 years under Boris Johnson, yet her actions to prevent mass immigration from spiraling out of control were to say the least, ‘negligible’ in fact, it was on her watch that legal migration exceeded 1 million for the first time.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_labour-opening-doors-to-more-illegal-immigration/content_529.html": "Labour opening doors to more illegal immigration\nLabour Waters Down Immigration Controls Amidst Controversy\nMinisters Face Backlash Over Changes to Border Security Legislation\nThe Labour government has announced significant modifications to border control legislation, prompting fierce criticism from opposition MPs over the softening of regulations concerning illegal migrants’ pathways to citizenship and age verification protocols.\nIn a controversial move, the Home Office is proceeding with the repeal of Conservative-implemented regulations that effectively barred small boat arrivals from obtaining British citizenship. Additionally, the government is rolling back legislation that previously authorised ministers to categorise asylum seekers who declined scientific age assessments as adults by default.\nThe Shadow Home Secretary, Chris Philp, launched a blistering critique of the policy shift, characterising it as a “total capitulation to people smugglers” that would transform the United Kingdom into “the soft touch of Europe”. However, government sources have defended the changes, arguing that the Conservative Party had made “such a mess” of implementing these powers that they remained dormant since their parliamentary passage.\nThe modifications emerge within the framework of the newly published Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which Labour ministers assert will address the ongoing small boats crisis. A detailed examination of the legislation reveals the government’s intention to repeal substantial portions of the previous Conservative government’s Illegal Migration Act, which had only received parliamentary approval in 2023.\nThe Conservative legislation had incorporated stringent provisions that rendered virtually any individual entering the country illegally ineligible for settled status and, ultimately, citizenship. Moreover, it contained a controversial clause empowering authorities to classify asylum seekers as adults if they refused to undergo scientific age assessment procedures.\nResponding to the changes, Mr Philp expressed grave concerns to The Telegraph, stating: “It will lead to dangerous young men being placed with teenage girls and makes the UK the soft touch of Europe. Starmer is a weak Prime Minister. He is weak on borders and is weak when it comes to protecting our borders, our children and our people.”\nThe age assessment debate has taken on particular significance given recent statistics. In the first six months of the previous year, authorities identified more than 1,300 illegal migrants who had falsely claimed to be minors. Official data demonstrates that unaccompanied minors enjoy significantly higher asylum approval rates, with three-quarters of cases receiving positive determinations compared to approximately half for adults.\nThe implications of age classification extend beyond asylum decisions. Those designated as under-18s receive educational placements and council accommodation, rather than being housed in migrant hotels. The current system relies on initial assessments conducted by two Home Office staff members who evaluate “physical appearance and demeanour”. Under existing guidelines, categorising an individual claiming to be a child as an adult requires evidence that “very strongly suggests they are significantly over 18 years of age”.\nIn contrast to British practices, other major European nations, including France and Germany, routinely employ medical examinations to determine asylum seekers’ ages. These assessments typically involve X-ray analyses of hand and wrist bones, molar teeth examinations, and MRI scans of knee and collar bones.\nWhilst the power to conduct such assessments in Britain was established through the 2022 Nationality and Borders Act, implementation remains pending. That legislation stipulated that officials must consider a migrant’s refusal to undergo such tests as “damaging” to their credibility regarding age-related claims. The subsequent 2023 Illegal Migration Act strengthened this position, enabling ministers to classify those refusing assessment as adults automatically.\nLabour’s current position maintains the more moderate 2022 powers whilst reserving the right to introduce stronger measures if deemed necessary. A government source dismissed accusations of being lenient on border controls, highlighting Conservative failures in managing illegal immigration: “Labour will continue to use age assessment and won’t hesitate to go further in legislation if needed.”\nThe citizenship ban had faced criticism for creating an unsustainable limbo situation for asylum seekers, effectively preventing the processing of their claims. Labour has committed to addressing the substantial backlog of 177,000 cases, which has resulted in 35,000 migrants being accommodated in hotels at an annual cost of £3 billion to taxpayers.\nFormer Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who spearheaded the Illegal Migration Act, accused Labour of “decriminalising illegal migration”. She denounced the Border Security Bill, stating it “removes all the security and provisions we had put into place to keep the UK safe and is a disgrace”. She added emphatically, “To put it bluntly, it is an insult to the British people. It shamefully opens up our borders and disgracefully allows illegal immigrants to become citizens.”\nRupert Lowe, the Reform MP for Great Yarmouth, offered a particularly stark assessment: “Our asylum system is already as soft as a boiled maggot. Zero tolerance is required. It is abundantly clear that thousands of males are fooling the incompetent Home Office through lies over their age, sexuality, religion and more. It is a scam. The word of the migrant is often taken as the truth, with ‘the benefit of the doubt’ regularly implemented as official policy.”\nLabour has defended its approach, emphasising that its reforms incorporate new deterrent measures, including substantial prison sentences for migrants who deliberately delay rescue until reaching UK waters. The Border Security Bill introduces an offence of endangering life at sea, carrying a maximum five-year custodial sentence. This provision specifically targets those who intentionally obstruct rescue efforts in French waters to ensure reaching British territory.\nFurthermore, the legislation criminalises the handling or supply of small boat components, engines, or life jackets intended for channel crossings, with offenders facing potential 14-year imprisonment terms.\nA Home Office spokesperson provided official comment: “The new Border Security Asylum and Immigration Bill introduces workable measures to strengthen cross-system, operational efforts to tighten border security, enhance upstream work with international partners and help ensure a properly functioning, secure immigration system.\n“The Illegal Migration Act has largely not been commenced (including this measure on age assessments); nor will it be under this Government’s policy which focuses on delivering long-term, credible policies that restore order to the asylum system.\n“We have robust processes in place to verify and assess an individual’s age where there is doubt, including the National Age Assessment Board, and have maintained the provisions on scientific assessments from the Nationality & Borders Act 2022.”\nThe ongoing debate reflects the complex challenges facing the UK’s immigration system and highlights the significant ideological differences between political parties regarding border control and asylum policy. As the legislation progresses through Parliament, it is likely to face continued scrutiny and debate from all sides of the political spectrum.",

These individuals, many of whom are explicitly prohibited from working due to their immigration status, subsequently transfer funds to their countries of origin to settle outstanding loans that financed their irregular Channel crossings.\nCriminal Networks Promote UK as Prime Destination\nUndercover conversations with smugglers operating across multiple countries have exposed sophisticated marketing strategies that specifically promote Britain as the ultimate asylum destination. These criminal networks emphasise two primary selling points: the relative ease of securing employment in the gig economy despite lacking proper documentation, and the guaranteed provision of government-funded hotel accommodation.\nA smuggler based in Istanbul was documented stating that the UK represents the optimal choice because “all you need is a mobile phone and a bike” to generate “good money”. This sentiment was echoed consistently across multiple smuggling networks contacted during the investigation.\nHotel Residents Share Resources for Illegal Work\nMigrants currently housed in Home Office-funded accommodation throughout the UK have revealed elaborate systems for sharing bicycles and illegal e-bikes—many modified to exceed legal speed limitations—to facilitate their unauthorised employment with food delivery applications.\nThese individuals typically work as “substitute” riders, utilising courier accounts that are illicitly rented through black market arrangements at costs ranging between £75 and £100 weekly. The practice has become so widespread that Home Office enforcement operations in 2023 discovered approximately 40 percent of delivery drivers stopped during random compliance checks were working illegally.\nOne resident interviewed at a London hotel accommodating hundreds of male asylum seekers claimed that “nearly all” fellow occupants were employed as self-employed couriers specifically to cover the costs of their Channel crossings.\nSome migrants reported facing increasing pressure from family members in their countries of origin who expect prompt settlement of debts incurred to finance their journey to Britain. This creates a cycle of financial obligation that further incentivises illegal employment.\nTrafficking Networks: Methodology and Communication\nThe investigation established contact with people smugglers operating from various locations including Turkey, Herat in western Afghanistan, Tehran in Iran, and migrant encampments across northern France. Contact details were obtained through British-based migrants and individuals living in makeshift camps in Calais and Dunkirk.\nThese criminal facilitators communicated in multiple languages, including combinations of Arabic, English, Persian, Dari, Pashto and Kurdish, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of their clientele.\nSecurity consciousness was paramount among smugglers, who predominantly relied on encrypted messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram. They frequently employed voice messages configured to automatically delete after being played, limiting the digital trail of their activities.\nAnalysis of telephone numbers revealed that their communication devices utilised SIM cards purchased in countries including Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, further complicating efforts to track their operations.\nRefined Sales Tactics and Misleading Promises\nThe investigation documented remarkably consistent sales techniques across different smuggling networks. These criminal operatives consistently encouraged potential “customers” to accumulate sufficient funds for the journey to Britain, emphasising the promise of substantial financial rewards upon arrival.\nA smuggler based in Dunkirk, who charged £1,370 (€1,600) for passage on a rigid-hulled inflatable boat and basic safety equipment, assured an investigator posing as a stranded migrant in Paris: “My friend, come to Dunkirk, I’m here waiting for you. I can send you to England.”\nThe same individual elaborated on purported advantages of reaching British shores: “The police will find you before you even reach the shore. They’ll take you to a hotel where you’ll have everything. The Government pays you, feeds you and they’ll even give you a good home. They won’t leave you out on the street, like in France.”\nHe specifically highlighted employment opportunities: “You’ll find work very easily. There are easy jobs you can do while staying in hotels they put you in. All you need is a phone and a bike to make good money. People there will help you.”\nDangerous Misinformation About Channel Crossing\nCriminal networks were documented systematically downplaying the serious risks associated with crossing the English Channel, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes where numerous migrant fatalities have occurred in recent years.\nA Turkish “agent” operating from Istanbul assured a potential client: “Getting to the UK is as easy as drinking a glass of water. Many I have sent have found work with nothing more than a mobile phone and a bike. Delivering food is the easiest option while your case is being reviewed. Trust me, life in England is great – you’ll earn plenty.”\nThis particular smuggler, charging £7,500 for complete journey arrangements, boasted of belonging to an extensive network with operational cells across multiple European countries.\n“When you get to France, you can imagine you’re already in London,” he added confidently.\nWhen specifically questioned about potential dangers of the Channel crossing, the same individual dismissively responded: “Don’t believe what you hear in the news – the crossing is easy.” Such dangerous misrepresentations have contributed to migrants making perilous journeys with incomplete understanding of the substantial risks involved.\nGuaranteed Income and Accommodation Emphasised\nA Calais-based people smuggler was recorded reassuring potential clients via encrypted messaging that any borrowed funds used to finance passage to the UK could be easily repaid through guaranteed employment opportunities.\nUsing religious language to build trust, he stated: “My dear brother, Inshallah, with God’s power, I’ll send you to England. You’ll make money very easily. I send many people. They work just by having a bike and delivering food. And after work you will have a hotel room to rest in.”\nThis comprehensive messaging strategy—combining promises of accommodation, income, and easy loan repayment—forms a powerful incentive structure that continues to drive irregular migration towards Britain despite government efforts to reduce Channel crossings.\nRecord Numbers Continue Despite Enforcement Efforts\nThe findings come during a period of heightened concern regarding irregular migration, with recent statistics indicating that the number of migrants crossing the Channel has reached 10,000 in record time under the current government. This represents a significant challenge for border enforcement and asylum processing systems.\nBroader Implications for Immigration Policy\nThe systematic exploitation of asylum seekers by criminal networks, combined with the circumvention of employment restrictions, raises complex questions about the effectiveness of current immigration controls and the management of asylum claims.\nThe revelation that substantial numbers of individuals prohibited from working are nevertheless finding employment in the gig economy highlights significant challenges in enforcing immigration regulations within flexible, technology-enabled work arrangements that characterise modern delivery services.\nAdditionally, the investigation demonstrates how smuggling networks have adapted their marketing approaches to specifically target the UK, emphasising perceived advantages in the asylum system and labour market that make Britain an attractive destination despite significant policy efforts to reduce irregular migration.\nAs government authorities continue addressing these challenges, the investigation underscores the sophisticated nature of criminal networks facilitating irregular migration and their ability to exploit vulnerabilities in immigration and employment systems across multiple countries.\nNeed for Coordinated Response\nThe findings suggest that addressing irregular migration and associated illegal employment requires coordination between multiple government departments, including the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, and transport authorities responsible for regulating delivery services.\nAdditionally, the investigation highlights the importance of international cooperation in disrupting criminal networks that operate across multiple countries, using sophisticated communication methods to evade detection while continuing to facilitate irregular migration to the United Kingdom.\nAs policy debates continue regarding appropriate responses to asylum claims and irregular migration, this investigation provides important context regarding the economic incentives, criminal facilitation, and practical realities that shape migration decisions and subsequent employment choices among asylum seekers awaiting the resolution of their cases.\nComment\nTargeting the underground industries that work around cash, illegal activity or illegal work is very easy, they are visible, they can be tracked, monitored, investigated and shut down, why don’t they do that?\nWe must make the UK less attractive to commercial migration at the expense of our society.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_china-is-hoarding-50-of-the-worlds-food-grain/content_898.html": "Less than 20% of the world’s population has managed to stockpile more than half of the globe’s maize and other grains, leading to steep price increases across the planet and dropping more countries into famine.\nThe hoarding is taking place in China.\nCOFCO Group, a major Chinese state-owned food processor, runs one of China’s largest food stockpiling bases, at the port of Dalian, in the north eastern part of the country. It stores beans and grains gathered from home and abroad in 310 huge silos. From there, the calories make their way throughout China via rail and sea.\nChina is maintaining its food stockpiles at a “historically high level,” Qin Yuyun, head of grain reserves at the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, told reporters in November. “Our wheat stockpiles can meet demand for one and a half years. There is no problem whatsoever about the supply of food.”\nAccording to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, China is expected to have 69% of the globe’s maize reserves in the first half of crop year 2022, 60% of its rice and 51% of its wheat.\nThe projections represent increases of around 20 percentage points over the past 10 years, and the data clearly shows that China continues to hoard grain.\nChina spent $98.1 billion importing food (beverages are not included) in 2020, up 4.6 times from a decade earlier, according to the General Administration of Customs of China. In the January-September period of 2021, China imported more food than it had since at least 2016, which is as far back as comparable data goes.\nOver the past five years, China’s soybean, maize and wheat imports soared two- to twelvefold on aggressive purchases from the U.S., Brazil and other supplier nations. Imports of beef, pork, dairy and fruit jumped two- to fivefold.\nSome of China’s imports are being aided by Chinese companies on overseas acquisition sprees. Leading meat processor WH Group acquired a European peer in June, while Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group purchased a leading New Zealand dairy company in 2019.\nFood prices are on the rise around the world. The food price index, calculated by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, in November stood about 30% higher than a year earlier. “Hoarding by China is one reason for rising prices,” said Akio Shibata, president of the Natural Resource Research Institute in Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo.\nChina is importing more grain and other food because domestic production is unable to keep up with consumption. While demand for feedstuffs for pigs and other livestock is expanding on the back of economic growth, the number of consumers looking for high-quality overseas produce is also increasing.\nChinese President Xi Jinping keeps stressing the importance of food security. The National People’s Congress, China’s national legislature, in April adopted a food waste law that bans excessive leftovers. At the end of October, the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council instructed officials on how to reduce food waste.\nAnd the NPC is not finished legislating on food security.\nChinese in their 50s and older experienced food shortages during the Cultural Revolution (1966 to 1976). “People of our generation remember hunger to a greater or lesser extent,” Xi once said, according to China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency.\nThroughout history, food shortages have triggered popular unrest. They served as a contributing factor to uprisings that toppled Chinese dynasties. And the world’s second largest economy now faces food uncertainties due to factors such as its deteriorating relations with the U.S. and Australia, which could drastically alter the import environment. In fact, this could be what is prodding China to boost its calorie reserves.\nThe number of people living in famine-struck regions topped 700 million in 2020, an increase of more than 100 million from five years earlier, according to the U.N.\n“Although developed nations as a whole are responsible for famine,” Takahashi said, “China’s responsibility is heavier. China should contribute to resolving the maldistribution of food.”\nCOMMENT:\nChina is driving up the cost of food around the world, which is drastically increasing food poverty in many countries. The world will invariably need to retaliate, before the matter gets out of hand. Grain is a finite resource and it is not possible to ignore what is happening, to do so would be catastrophic for the rest of the world. Even developed countries will suffer as a result, as the price of grain continues to escalate.\nThis is yet another example of the autocratic, and arrogant mindset of the CCP, which is intent on flexing its political muscles in any way possible, but the consequences for China could be serious, when they suffer a backlash.",

While the move has been presented as a means to curb fraud and financial crimes, critics argue that it might inadvertently drive our society further towards becoming cashless. As major high street banks consider following NatWest’s lead, the implications for the millions who still rely on physical currency for their daily transactions are significant.\n**The Shift Towards Restricting Cash Transactions**\nNatWest, a bank partially owned by taxpayers, has stirred the pot by announcing plans to implement daily and annual limits on cash deposits and withdrawals. While these restrictions are justified by the bank as protective measures against fraud and financial crime, they raise concerns about accessibility for those who depend on cash for their daily needs. The changes will cap deposits at £3,000 a day for in-branch transactions, and while the bank’s motives are understandable, critics fear it may further marginalize vulnerable groups and seniors who rely on cash for their transactions.\nThis move comes at a time when over 1,000 bank branches have been closed since last year, compromising access to cash for numerous individuals across the country. With the imminent threat of additional branch closures, the availability of cash could become even more limited.\n**The Ripple Effect on Banking Policies**\nWhile NatWest’s initiative has caused quite a stir, other major high street banks are in a state of contemplation. While none have explicitly announced plans to implement similar limits, the fact that none have ruled it out is telling. The potential repercussions for the eight million individuals who rely on cash as part of their daily routine are significant.\nIt’s not just NatWest that’s impacting the cash landscape. Other banks already apply certain restrictions to individual cash transactions. For instance, Barclays caps cash withdrawals at £2,000 unless more than 24 hours’ notice is given. HSBC offers a more generous limit of £10,000. When it comes to cash machine transactions, Santander limits deposits to £2,000 per day and up to £10,000 annually. Lloyds and Barclays, on the other hand, offer a more flexible approach, not limiting the number of deposits but rather the number of notes per transaction.\n**The Concerns of Advocates and Observers**\nDerek French, founder of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, is apprehensive about the implications of NatWest’s move. He fears that the restrictions will further contribute to the decline of traditional high street branches and hinder access to cash for those who need it most. French emphasizes that banking customers should have the right to deposit and withdraw cash from their own bank without undue restrictions.\nNatWest’s decision, in particular, could be influenced by its previous brushes with money laundering regulations, which led to substantial fines. Some observers speculate that the bank’s move to tighten cash transactions could be an attempt to demonstrate a proactive stance in compliance.\n**What Lies Ahead for Cash Transactions**\nAs the banking landscape continues to evolve, it’s essential to consider the broader implications of restricting cash transactions. While digital payments offer convenience and efficiency, they can inadvertently exclude segments of the population who are not fully comfortable with technology or who do not have access to the necessary tools. The elderly and financially vulnerable are particularly at risk of being left behind in this cashless shift.\nThe future of cash transactions hinges on the decisions made by major banks. While some, like Santander, assert that they have no immediate plans to change their deposit and withdrawal limits, others remain ambiguous about their stance. The potential for these policies to shape the trajectory of our financial landscape cannot be underestimated.\nAs we move forward, it’s vital to strike a balance between technological advancements and the needs of all members of society. A cashless future may be on the horizon, but it must be an inclusive one that considers the accessibility and security of financial transactions for every individual.",

The reality was, that this illusion of cheaper goods was enough to misdirect people from all of the consequences of open borders. The reality was, that one year later in 2004, the borders opened and the UK was flooded with the larged inward migration in history.\nWhilst big business welcomed the prospect of unlimited cheap labour, there was a very high price to pay and this price was to be paid by the poorest, the most disadvantaged and the vulnerable.\nIn the first place, those on minimum wage who relied on overtime at a higher rate, were suddenly plunged in to extreme poverty, as employers began to limit overtime to existing employees, because they could employ desperate workers from former Eastern Block countries at lower rates.\nIn reality, millions of people who were previously managing, were subjected to a pay cut by stealth, but this was just the start.\nAs the population began to swell, with young immigrants desperate for housing to bring families to live with them, the demand on housing began to increase disproportionately, once again, the poorest were the ones to suffer most, as they would increasingly face higher rents that were being asked in line with higher demand.\nThere was increasing demand for public services, schools, healthcare, which was once again at the expense of the poorest section of the existing population, who were increasingly side-lined.\nYears later, we are facing the worst housing crisis since 1945, with the private rental market slowly collapsing under the legislation that was designed to protect tenants, but which in actual fact has resulted in less and less properties available for rent.\nIt seems that with every stroke of a pen, every raising of a hand in parliament, the organised deception continues.\nThe latest example of this has been the entire environmental agenda, which has seen ordinary people punished for actions that have little bearing on the real cause.\nAs a result, energy prices have increased exponentially due to green levies being added to utility bills, much of which has been distributed in grants to a certain few, who have made a fortune blighting our countryside with ugly wind turbines, in the meantime, the entire energy industry has been left so dependant on imported gas, that once again, as soon as there was an issue with supply, ie: the war in Ukraine, prices went through the roof, once again, causing those in need to suffer the most.\nThe latest example of ‘Bait & Switch’ must be Electric Cars, we have all been led to believe that within a decade or so, we will be living in a utopian world of clean transport, driving around in environmentally friendly EVs, with no emissions and no noise pollution, but nothing could be further from the truth.\nThe truth being, as the walls of reality come crashing towards us, is that EVs are not practical and will not be practical for a very long time, the entire infrastructure is collapsing due to a small but insignificant increase in EVs over the last year or two, with people across the country suffering severe problems with range anxiety, issues with charging and many of them are tied in to lease contracts that they are unable to walk away from, others who actually bought these vehicles, suddenly finding that the value of them has plummeted in recent weeks, by thousands of pounds.\nWhat is in fact happening, is that EVs are being used as the bait, but the reality is, that with every EV that is sold, yet another ICE(internal combustion engine) car is taken off the road and crushed. In a decade or so, we will not all be driving around in EVs, we will in act enter an age, where the average person cannot afford an EV, or the associated road charges that are being implemented at a rapidly increasing rate, along with all of the restrictions that are being planned for towns & cities throughout the country.\nThis is not a change to EVs on a national scale, this is in fact the eradication of the car, for the majority of people on a national scale, along with their freedom and civil liberties.\nLithium, which is an essential part of modern batteries is often mined in appalling conditions by children, but nobody seems to care about that, the net environmental damage resulting from the manufacture and run each EV is actually more than an ICE cars, but they don’t mention that.\nThe damage to the roads from the additional weight, the danger to pedestrians from being hit by a vehicle that has up to three times the weight and therefore three times the momentum of an ICE car is also hushed, this is the proverbial Wool being pulled over the eyes of the entire nation.\nBait & Switch, the tried and tested formula for misleading the masses, look out for it, rearing its head behind an issue near you soon!",

After several years dominated by unprecedented Covid-19 bailout programmes and the subsequent battle against rampant inflation, these central bankers would have been anticipating a welcome respite of calm, steady economic growth and normalising monetary policy.\nHowever, Donald Trump has dramatically altered this trajectory by implementing a sweeping array of global tariffs, effectively increasing American import duties to their highest level in more than a century. The former president, now returned to office, has wasted no time in pursuing his protectionist agenda, much to the alarm of economists and policymakers worldwide.\nThe ramifications of the president’s aggressive trade war are becoming increasingly apparent, with nervous economists hastily revising growth forecasts downwards and raising their projections for the likelihood of a global economic recession. Financial markets have responded with predictable volatility, as investors scramble to reposition portfolios in anticipation of a more challenging economic landscape.\nTerrible Timing for Indebted Governments\nThis economic upheaval could scarcely arrive at a more inopportune moment for particularly indebted governments across the globe. Many nations are already grappling with mounting pressures to increase borrowing to fund essential public services, including welfare benefits, healthcare systems and bolstered defence spending. The latter has taken on increased significance amidst growing geopolitical tensions.\nNow, these same governments will need to devote additional resources to propping up their faltering economies. And this is precisely where central banks find themselves thrust once again into the spotlight, despite having hoped to take a more measured approach to monetary policy following years of extraordinary intervention.\nBank of England Recalibrates Its Approach\nMartin Weale, who previously served as a member of the Bank of England’s influential Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), notes that his assessment has shifted dramatically in a matter of days. He reveals that merely a week earlier, he would have anticipated persistent inflationary pressures preventing Threadneedle Street from implementing further interest rate reductions in the coming month.\nHowever, the rapidly evolving economic situation has fundamentally altered this calculus. Weale now suspects the MPC will prioritise growth by cutting rates, despite the inherent risk that tariffs could potentially reignite inflationary pressures that the Bank has worked so diligently to contain.\n“They may go back into the sort of mode that was very much demonstrated in the pandemic,” he explains, drawing parallels to the Bank’s previous crisis response. “When it looks as though demand is weak, you ease monetary policy.”\nWillem Buiter, another former MPC rate-setter with considerable influence in economic circles, believes that sterling’s relative strength will provide the Bank with additional leeway to ease rates. He also points out that falling oil prices will further strengthen the argument for monetary loosening.\n“The global economy, including the UK, will experience slower economic growth as a result of the tariff aggression announced on Trump’s ‘liberation day’,” he observes with evident concern. “With sterling likely to strengthen vis-à-vis the US dollar and to weaken vis-à-vis the euro, there will at most be a mild inflationary impact [from] the trade war. I expect the Bank of England to cut Bank Rate slightly more quickly as real economic activity weakens.”\nBuiter’s projections are specific and sobering. He anticipates four additional rate reductions that would take the base rate down to 3.5 percent. However, he cautions that “if the trade war is more intense, temporary additional cuts in Bank Rate to below 3.5 percent are likely.” This suggests the potential for even more aggressive monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate more severely than currently expected.\nMarket expectations have shifted dramatically in response to these developments. The day before Trump announced his far-reaching tariff plans, financial markets had anticipated two further rate cuts from the Bank of England this year. Now, they are pricing in three rate reductions, with the possibility of yet another early in the following year. This represents a significant shift in monetary policy expectations within an extraordinarily compressed timeframe.\nSimilar Patterns Emerging Globally\nSimilar recalibrations of monetary policy expectations are materialising across the eurozone and the United States, highlighting the truly global nature of this economic challenge. Central banks worldwide are grappling with essentially the same fundamental dilemma: determining how far they can reduce interest rates to support faltering economic growth without inadvertently triggering a renewed inflationary spiral.\nOlivier Blanchard, who previously held the prestigious position of chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate economic impact of these trade policies. Nevertheless, he suggests that policymakers are likely to prioritise economic stability over inflation concerns in the immediate term.\n“Surely the risk of a world recession has substantially increased, and with it [the chance of getting] low rates,” Blanchard notes with characteristic insight. “I think the recession will dominate whatever inflation concerns may arise.” This assessment suggests a fundamental reordering of central bank priorities in response to the growing threat of economic contraction.\nEuropean Central Bank Under Pressure\nInvestors are increasingly betting on accelerated interest rate reductions globally, with particular emphasis on Europe. Goldman Sachs, the influential investment bank, has issued a stark assessment suggesting that the eurozone stands precariously close to recession, with even modest additional economic shocks potentially sufficient to tip the bloc into negative growth territory.\nFinancial markets are currently pricing in three additional eurozone rate cuts between now and September. The European Central Bank’s (ECB) next monetary policy announcement, scheduled in just two weeks’ time, is increasingly expected to include a rate reduction to 2.25 percent, with further cuts anticipated to bring rates down to approximately 1.75 percent by the autumn.\nGoldman Sachs’ analysis paints an even more concerning picture, suggesting there exists a one-in-three probability that rates could decline even further, contingent upon how rapidly the economic outlook deteriorates. This represents a remarkable shift in expectations compared to just weeks earlier, when many analysts were predicting a much more gradual easing cycle.\nPeter Praet, who served as chief economist at the ECB for nearly a decade and thus possesses intimate knowledge of the institution’s decision-making processes, anticipates further reductions in borrowing costs across the eurozone.\n“All data are supportive of a cut,” he states unequivocally. “In its own logic of data-driven decisions, the ECB should cut. One can add that the negative impact of extremely high uncertainty on demand will reinforce the case.”\nPraet acknowledges the potential inflationary implications of protectionist policies but cautions against policy paralysis. “Admittedly, it will have to monitor potential upwards price pressures from protectionism, but such risk should not lead to policy paralysis.” This suggests a preference for decisive action despite the inherent uncertainties.\nHowever, Praet also emphasises the need for central banks to maintain flexibility and readiness to respond to further economic disruptions. “I see another cut in June, but beyond that, I would be more careful as extreme situations can unfold.” His uncertainty regarding when economic conditions might stabilise is particularly telling: “The economy will not be in equilibrium for a while.” This assessment suggests an extended period of volatility and adjustment lies ahead.\nFederal Reserve’s Unique Challenge\nThe United States Federal Reserve confronts a somewhat different, yet equally complex, dilemma compared to its European counterparts. Calibrating monetary policy to ensure the world’s largest economy maintains appropriate balance – neither overheating nor unduly cooling – presents formidable challenges even during relatively stable periods.\nBut now, the Fed faces the extraordinarily difficult task of attempting to contain price increases – potentially exacerbated by tariffs effectively imposing additional costs on American consumers – while simultaneously working to prevent a recession. This balancing act represents perhaps the most significant test for the institution since the global financial crisis.\nHistorical precedent suggests that the Federal Reserve typically implements aggressive rate reductions during economic downturns, prioritising growth and employment over short-term inflationary concerns. Many analysts anticipate a similar approach this time, though with important caveats given the unique circumstances.\nChris Iggo, a senior figure at Axa Investment Management, believes this historical pattern will likely be repeated despite the complexities involved. He expresses a personal stake in these outcomes while acknowledging the broader economic implications.\n“I don’t enjoy contemplating a global recession and equity bear market – my pension pot is in reach and I don’t want it to be diminished,” he confesses candidly. “Yet I can’t conclude a happier outcome when the US administration has no empathy with the rest of the world and is prepared to use strong-arm and barely believable tactics to get what it appears to think will be good for Americans.”\nDivergent Views on Federal Reserve Response\nNot all economic experts share this assessment, however. Dame DeAnne Julius, a founding member of the Bank of England’s MPC and respected voice in international economic circles, expresses scepticism regarding market expectations of substantial US monetary easing. Current market pricing suggests approximately four rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but Julius questions whether this accurately reflects the likely policy trajectory.\nShe points out that the Fed’s relatively recent missteps in addressing persistent inflation remain fresh in the minds of policymakers and continue to influence their decision-making framework. “The Fed will be very concerned about letting inflation spike up again, and so I don’t think they’ll be cutting rates, even if the economy slows,” she argues, suggesting a more cautious approach than markets currently anticipate.\nMixed Implications for Borrowers\nLower interest rates might superficially appear advantageous for borrowers across various sectors, but economists caution that these benefits are unlikely to fully offset the negative consequences of slowing economic growth. This creates a complex picture for households, businesses and governments alike as they navigate the changing economic landscape.\nAndrew Goodwin, a respected economist at Oxford Economics, suggests that shifting market expectations could potentially create additional fiscal headroom for the Chancellor compared to projections made during the Spring Statement. This might theoretically provide greater flexibility for government spending or tax adjustments.\nHowever, Goodwin immediately tempers this assessment with an important caveat: “When the Office for Budget Responsibility comes to update its forecasts, I suspect the impact of changes in financial market pricing will be outweighed by changes to the broader economic forecast and by the need to increase defence spending beyond 2.5 percent of GDP.” This suggests that any apparent fiscal benefits from lower borrowing costs could prove illusory once the full economic impact is accounted for.\nBeginning of Prolonged Economic Turbulence\nMany analysts fear this represents merely the opening phase of a potentially prolonged period of economic turbulence, as policymakers attempt to track, predict and respond to the cascading effects and counter-effects of an escalating global trade war. The complexity is magnified by the multidimensional and rapidly evolving nature of the situation.\nCentral bankers already face extraordinary challenges in calibrating their responses solely to Trump’s announced tariffs. Yet this represents just one element of a much broader and more complex economic picture. China has already implemented retaliatory border taxes, while the European Union is actively contemplating its own countermeasures. Meanwhile, Trump himself continues deliberating potential tariffs on additional industries, such as pharmaceuticals, which have thus far escaped his protectionist measures.\nFurther complicating matters is the president’s well-documented tendency toward policy unpredictability. Despite his emphatic declarations regarding the permanence of these tariff measures, historical precedent suggests the possibility of abrupt policy reversals without warning. This unpredictability introduces an additional layer of complexity for policymakers attempting to formulate appropriate monetary responses.\nCritical Decision Point Approaching\nThe Bank of England has until 8 May to make its next monetary policy decision, a timeframe that Martin Weale considers fortunate given the volatile nature of the current situation.\n“Given the rate at which Trump changes his mind – he has said he is not going to change his mind on these tariffs, but he might change his mind on not changing his mind – I think it is lucky that they don’t have to make the decision this week,” Weale observes with a hint of wry humour that nevertheless underscores the genuine uncertainty confronting central bankers.\nAs financial markets continue adjusting to this new economic reality, households and businesses across the United Kingdom are bracing for the potential impacts on their financial wellbeing. While lower interest rates might provide some relief for borrowers, the broader economic slowdown threatens employment, investment and overall prosperity. The precise contours of this evolving economic landscape remain uncertain, but what appears increasingly clear is that the era of monetary policy normalisation has been abruptly interrupted, with significant implications for economic stability both domestically and globally.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_major-car-tax-changes-set-to-impact-uk-motorists/content_341.html": "Major Car Tax Changes Set to Impact UK Motorists\n## Introduction\nIn a significant development, new car tax changes are on the horizon, poised to affect thousands of motorists across the UK. The HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has recently unveiled plans for a comprehensive overhaul in taxation policies, with a particular focus on double cab pickup trucks.\n## Charging Double Cab Pickup Trucks as Company Cars\nCommencing from July 1st, 2024, the HMRC will initiate the practice of charging double cab pickup trucks as company cars. This shift is part of a broader initiative to redefine benefit in kind tax rules, potentially leading to substantial price hikes for company car drivers.\n## Five-Fold Increase in Personal Tax Bills\nUnder the revamped rules, individuals purchasing double cab pickup trucks after July 1st, 2024, could face a near five-fold increase in their personal tax bills. HMRC is altering its interpretation of the legislation defining cars and vans for tax purposes, deviating from the definitions used for VAT purposes.\n## Impact on Business Users\nPreviously, any pickup with a payload exceeding 1,000 kg was deemed a commercial vehicle in line with VAT rules. This distinction allowed business users to reclaim tax on their vans and pickup trucks. The new rule, as explained by HMRC, aims to pragmatically address the primary suitability and classification of double cab pickups.\n## Massive Changes in Company Car Tax\nThe UK, known for its substantial number of pickup trucks on the roads due to a favorable VAT system and low benefit in kind taxation rates, will witness substantial changes in company car tax. A 20% taxpayer in England may find themselves paying £291 per month, while a 40% taxpayer could face a monthly bill of £582, marking a significant departure from the current rates.\n## Government’s Vehicle Taxation Overhaul\nIn alignment with the car tax changes, the government has confirmed an increase in tax rates for vehicles from the new financial year in 2024. Cars, vans, and motorcycles will experience rises in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rates, tied to the retail price index, starting April 1st, 2024. Additionally, electric vehicles will be required to pay VED from April 2025, following calls from Chancellor Jeremy Hunt for a fairer taxation system for all drivers.\n## Anticipated Addressing of Bik Tax Rates\nAs the government undertakes these sweeping changes, there are expectations that the upcoming Spring Statement on March 6th will shed light on potential adjustments to bik tax rates, providing further clarity for taxpayers.\n## Rule Changes for HGV Drivers\nSimultaneously, rule changes for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers are set to take effect this month. Tachographs, instruments recording driving duration, speed, and distance traveled, will require a full smart tachograph 2 or transitional smart tachograph 2 in newly registered vehicles over 3.5 tons and passenger vehicles with 10 or more seats from February 21st, 2024. These smart tachographs enable easier data collection and interconnectivity with apps like smart parking or Pig drive.\n## Future Tachograph Rule Changes\nFurther changes in tachograph rules are anticipated at the end of December, scheduled for August 2025 and July 2026, reflecting the evolving landscape of regulations in the transportation sector.\nIn Summary\n1. **Car Tax Changes from July 1st, 2024:**\n– New tax measures by HM Revenue and Customs will impact UK motorists.\n– Double cab pickup trucks will be charged as company cars starting July 1st.\n– Benefit in kind tax rule changes may lead to significant price hikes for company car drivers.\n– Pickup trucks with a payload of over 1,000 kg will no longer be considered commercial vehicles for tax purposes.\n– A 20% taxpayer in England could face a five-fold increase, paying £291 per month in company car tax, compared to the current £60 per month.\n2. **Government’s Vehicle Taxation Changes:**\n– Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rates for cars, vans, and motorcycles will rise from April 1st, 2024.\n– Electric vehicles will start paying VED from April 2025.\n– Chancellor Jeremy Hunt advocates for a fairer taxation system for all drivers.\n– Expectations for potential changes to bik tax rates in the upcoming Spring Statement on March 6th.\n3. **HGV Driver Rule Changes:**\n– Tachograph rules for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers are changing.\n– From February 21st, 2024, smart tachographs must be fitted in newly registered vehicles over 3.5 tons or with 10 or more seats.\n– Smart tachographs facilitate easier data collection and can interconnect with apps like smart parking or Pig drive.\n– Additional tachograph rule changes are scheduled for August 2025 and July 2026.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-conservative-party-is-dying/content_100.html": "The Conservative Party is Dying\nThe Conservative Party’s Existential Crisis: A Terminal Decline?\nA Once-Mighty Institution in Peril\nThe Conservative Party, that venerable institution which for centuries has proudly touted itself as “the world’s most successful political party”, now faces what many political analysts characterise as an existential threat. Throughout its storied history, the party has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for reinvention and regeneration when confronted with potentially terminal challenges. From Benjamin Disraeli’s astute embracing of electoral reform in the 19th century to Margaret Thatcher’s revolutionary economic policies in the late 20th century, Conservatives have repeatedly shown themselves capable of dramatic transformations when circumstances demand it.\nYet the present situation appears particularly dire. The party of Peel and Disraeli, Churchill and Thatcher—names that evoke the golden chapters of British political history—now finds itself in a predicament of unprecedented gravity. The question that haunts Conservative parliamentarians, councillors, and activists across the nation is stark: can the party once again pull off the remarkable feat of reinvention, or are we witnessing the beginning of the end for this historic political force?\nThe Unpopularist Problem\nBritain’s current political landscape is not merely characterised by the rise of populism, as many commentators have suggested. Rather, it suffers from what might more accurately be termed an “unpopularist” problem—a fundamental crisis of confidence in the established political order. Recent local election results have laid bare this uncomfortable truth, with both major parties experiencing significant electoral setbacks.\nThe Labour Party, despite occupying the government benches, has haemorrhaged support in alarming fashion. It has alienated voters to its left, disappointed substantial portions of its traditional working-class base, and lost councillors in percentages that mirror Conservative losses. This simultaneous erosion of support for Britain’s two dominant political forces has created a vacuum that Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has adroitly exploited, making remarkable electoral inroads that would have seemed fantastical just a few years ago.\nHowever, the two mainstream parties face fundamentally different scenarios. Labour, having secured a parliamentary majority, possesses the considerable advantage of a four-year timeframe in which to set the political agenda and potentially improve its standing with the electorate. For the Conservatives, no such luxury exists. Their situation is not merely challenging; it is existential. The path to power for Farage and Reform UK necessarily involves supplanting the Tories as the primary opposition force—a prospect that now appears increasingly plausible.\nHistorical Precedents and False Comfort\nThose seeking reassurance might point to previous challenges to Britain’s traditional two-party dominance. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) of the 1980s briefly threatened to “break the mould” of British politics, coming within 700,000 votes of overtaking a Labour Party that had moved sharply leftward under Michael Foot’s leadership. Yet the unforgiving mathematics of Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system ultimately confined this new political grouping to just 23 parliamentary seats, despite impressive vote totals, because their support was too evenly spread across constituencies rather than efficiently concentrated.\nBy the subsequent general election, Labour had begun its long march back toward the political centre, and the SDP’s moment had passed. Many Conservatives today cling to this historical precedent, taking comfort in the assumption that Reform UK might follow a similar trajectory of initial promise followed by electoral irrelevance.\nSuch comfort, however, appears dangerously misplaced. There are compelling reasons to believe that Reform UK might avoid the SDP’s fate and pose a more enduring challenge to Conservative hegemony on the right of British politics.\nA Perfect Storm for Farage\nThe political constellation appears remarkably favourable for Nigel Farage’s ambitions. His assault on the Conservative fortress comes at a moment when the Tory brand has suffered catastrophic damage to its reputation for competence and coherence. The Conservative Party is being unceremoniously chased out of almost every region of the United Kingdom. Losing ground in the north is undoubtedly problematic, but the erosion of its electoral base in southern England—long considered impregnable Conservative territory—could prove fatal.\nVoters actively seeking an effective opposition to Labour’s programme are demonstrating a pronounced disinterest in the Conservative offering. In our increasingly fragmented political landscape, Reform UK requires a substantially lower share of the overall vote to establish the narrative that it represents the primary alternative to Labour than would have been necessary in previous eras.\nA crucial distinction between the SDP challenge of the 1980s and Reform UK’s current insurgency lies in their respective positioning on the political spectrum. Whereas the SDP battled for control of the centre ground, Reform threatens the Conservatives from the nationalist right. The Conservative instinct will inevitably be to shift rightward to reclaim this territory, but such a manoeuvre carries significant risks. A rightward lurch will make it exponentially more difficult to win back those southern voters who are migrating in substantial numbers to the Liberal Democrats.\nThe Labour Party of the 1980s, despite its electoral difficulties, retained critical institutional advantages: the steadfast backing of trade unions, significantly higher levels of party loyalty among its core voters, and a clearly defined demographic base. None of these structural advantages apply to the Conservative Party in its current predicament.\nLeadership Deficits\nTo rebuild their shattered standing, Conservatives must appear to offer credible solutions to the issues that most concern voters. Thus far, they have manifestly failed in this essential task. Kemi Badenoch, recently elevated to the leadership position, does not appear to be connecting effectively with the broader electorate. Her performance is being overshadowed by that of Robert Jenrick, her defeated leadership rival, who projects greater energy and effectiveness in opposition. Her front bench team has singularly failed to land meaningful political blows on Labour’s economic management, despite numerous opportunities to do so.\nA significant aspect of the Conservative predicament stems from the extraordinary depletion of talent that followed Brexit—a self-inflicted wound of historic proportions. Conservative politicians of calibre, intellectual heft and charismatic appeal were largely purged from the party during its prolonged Brexit convulsions. The resulting leadership contest that elevated Badenoch was widely viewed as a dispiriting cavalcade of mediocrity, offering little hope of the transformative leadership the party so desperately requires.\nBy stark contrast, in Nigel Farage, Reform UK possesses a political leader of exceptional gifts who has demonstrated a remarkable ability to set the agenda in British politics for two decades. Farage’s approach is distinctive: he identifies causes with populist potential and then works assiduously to popularise them, rather than merely following existing public opinion. The evidence increasingly suggests that this may be his moment of maximum opportunity. Across the Western world, right-wing politics is realigning around his brand of populist nationalism, creating favourable conditions for his advance.\nA Strategic Dilemma\nFarage’s strategic approach involves vacating some traditional right-wing territory in pursuit of what he perceives as the new centre ground—one that combines cultural conservatism with economically left-leaning positions. This shrewd recalibration has left the Conservatives in an apparent state of confusion, unsure whether to contest this space directly or to fashion a more outward-looking, economically liberal platform that might distinguish them from both Labour and Reform.\nThe Conservative Party’s only viable path forward involves crafting a different and genuinely inclusive approach that offers a compelling, forward-looking alternative to Reform UK’s offering. This necessitates ceasing to project the impression that they harbour contempt for substantial segments of the country. In essence, they must compete effectively in the mainstream with Labour and regain electoral ground by presenting themselves as a credible alternative government rather than continuing as a faltering alternative opposition.\nIt should surprise no one that a party so recently thrashed at the polls is struggling to find its political feet. However, the meteoric rise of Reform UK means the Conservatives do not have the luxury of an extended period of convalescence and reflection. The political environment is unfolding with such unprecedented volatility that confident predictions about the electoral landscape four years hence would be foolhardy. Reform UK will inevitably make strategic and tactical errors. Labour strategists believe that certain voters can be prised away from Farage’s party by highlighting his proximity to Donald Trump and, more crucially, questioning his commitment to preserving the National Health Service.\nConclusion: A Fight to the Death\nNevertheless, the Conservative Party can no longer harbour any illusions about the gravity of its situation. The self-proclaimed “world’s most successful political party” currently finds itself locked in a desperate struggle for its very survival. Without a radical reimagining of its purpose and appeal, without a leadership capable of articulating a compelling vision for 21st century Britain, and without a demonstrable commitment to addressing the genuine concerns of ordinary citizens, the Conservative Party risks becoming a footnote in British political history—a once-mighty institution that failed to adapt to changing times and paid the ultimate political price.\nThe challenge is existential; the timeframe for meeting it is rapidly diminishing. The Conservative Party stands at the most perilous crossroads in its long and storied history. Whether it possesses the wisdom, courage and leadership to navigate this crisis remains an open question—one whose answer will profoundly shape British politics for generations to come.",

He served as a monk in Machairas monastery until 1783 when he left for Wallachia for further theological studies returning to Cyprus in 1802. He became archbishop of Cyprus in 1810. He founded the Pancyprian Gymnasium (originally called the Hellenic School) in 1812 which was the first secondary school on the island and which is still located opposite the archbishopric in Nicosia.\nIn 1818, Kyprianos was initiated into the Friendly Society (Philiki Etairia) which was preparing the ground for war and liberation from the Ottoman Empire. In 1820, Alexander Ypsilantis contacted the archbishop asking for Cyprus to join in the armed struggle. Kyprianos’ reply was pragmatic: He suggested that Cyprus support the upcoming revolution with money and supplies as any armed struggle was bound to end in disaster. Cyprus, being an isolated island far from Greece, had no substantial navy and no tradition of Klepht warfare like other parts of the Greek world.\nArchbishop Kyprianos was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus.\nHowever, when the Greek War of Independence broke out on 25 March 1821, Cypriots left in large numbers to fight in Greece, while proclamations were distributed in every corner of the island. The local pasha, Küçük Mehmet, reacted with fury, calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots.\nArchbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened but refused to do so. Finally, on 9 July 1821 Küçük Mehmet had the gates to the walled city of Nicosia closed and executed, by beheading or hanging, 470 important Cypriots amongst them Chrysanthos (bishop of Paphos), Meletios (bishop of Kition) and Lavrentios of (bishop of Kyrenia). Archbishop Kyprianos was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus. The events leading up to his execution were documented in an epic poem written in the Cypriot dialect by Vassilis Michaelides.\nAfter the local people found out that he was hanged, they bricked up the door, so nobody would ever walk through it again.\nWhen Bishop Lavrentios left for an audience with pasha, Küçük Mehmet, where he was hanged, he left the church of Chrisoplitissa, in Kyrenia through this door. After the local people found out that he was hanged, they bricked up the door, so nobody would ever walk through it again.",

It was formally rolled out in England and Wales in 2014, following the landmark campaign led by Clare’s father Michael Brown.\nUnder Clare’s Law, you have the right to:\n-Make an application to the police requesting information about your current or ex-partner, because you are worried they may have been abusive in the past and believe they may pose a risk to you in future.\n-Request information from the police about the current or ex-partner of a close friend, neighbour or family member, because you are concerned that they might be at risk of domestic abuse in future.\nThis is called the ‘right to ask.’ You have a right to ask the police no matter if your enquiry relates to a heterosexual or same-sex relationship, as long as you are aged 16 or older. You also have the right to ask about a partner regardless of your (or your neighbour, friend or family member’s) gender identity, ethnicity, race, religion or other characteristics.\nYou also have the ‘right to know’. This means that if police checks show that your current or ex-partner has a record of violent or abusive behaviour, and they believe you may be at risk, they may decide to proactively share that information with you. If you’re worried that your current or former partner has been abusive or violent in the past, Clare’s Law was created to formally give you the right to find out.\nWhat is Claire’s law?\nClare’s Law is formally known as the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS) in England\nDVDS is a police-run scheme that lets you, or any member of the public formally request or receive usually confidential information about a romantic partner’s criminal history.\nThis might be a current partner who you are worried might have been abusive in the past. It can also be an ex-partner you are no longer involved with but believe may be a threat to your safety.\nYou can make a DVDS application if you believe you are personally at risk of abuse, or are concerned on behalf of a close friend or relative.\nUnder Clare’s Law you have two rights: to ask, and to know\n1- The ‘right to ask’ means that you can make a DVDS application to ask about a current or ex-partner that you think might have a record of abusive behaviour or violence. Any information that the police share with you about a partner is called ‘disclosure’.\nYou can also ask on behalf of a close friend or relative, who you think might be at risk from their current or former partner. However, you may not necessarily receive any disclosure depending on who you are. The police may decide it is more appropriate to share with your loved one directly, or with someone who is more able to protect their safety.\n2- The ‘right to know’ means that if police checks show that your current or ex-partner has a history of abusive behaviour, they may proactively share that information with you because they believe you are at future risk.\nClare’s Law disclosures have to be considered ‘lawful’, ‘proportionate’ and ‘necessary’\nThis means that police must first decide whether it is appropriate to disclose your partner’s confidential records as part of your DVDS application. If there is enough to suggest that you may be at risk, then the police will make a collective decision on what information to disclose to you.\nIf you are applying on your own behalf, then the police will disclose any information directly to you – usually in person. If you’re applying on behalf of someone else, any disclosure is likely to depend on your relationship to that person and your ability to keep them safe.\nShould your partner not be known to the police, or if police checks suggest that there isn’t a threat to your safety then the police will tell you so. In this case, they are not required to share any disclosure with you or anyone else.\nClare’s Law disclosures take into account different definitions of domestic abuse\nAbuse isn’t only limited to physical abuse. It can also include harassment, verbal abuse, stalking, psychological threats or manipulation , sexual assault and violent behaviour. Anyone can experience domestic abuse regardless of age, race, ethnic or religious backgrounds, sexuality, class or disability.\nDomestic Abuse can be defined as an incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive, threatening, degrading and violent behaviour – including sexual and physical violence. With continued changes to the law Domestic Abuse can include:\n-psychological and or emotional abuse\n-physical and sexual abuse\n-financial or economic abuse\n-harassment and stalking\n-and also online or digital abuse.\nPolice will normally take these different definitions of abuse into account when considering what information to disclose as part of a DVDS application.\nClare’s Law was created to help prevent future domestic abuse\nA former legal loophole made it possible for domestic abusers or people with a prior record of violent or abusive behaviour to conceal their personal records. This meant that their partners were more likely to remain unaware of past offences, and so at greater risk of future harm. Clare Wood, who the law is named after, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend due to this lack of knowledge.\nAfter a lengthy campaign, Clare’s father Michael Brown was finally able to get this law changed. Now any member of the public has the right to ask the police about the criminal history of a partner they believe might be putting their own safety, or the safety of someone they know, at risk.\nClare’s Law changed from a policy to a law\nDomestic Abuse Bill received Royal Assent on 29th April 2021.The Domestic Abuse Act 2021 has been described as the most comprehensive package ever and focuses on bringing the issue of Domestic Abuse to the forefront of society. The Act includes the first statutory government definition of “Domestic Abuse” which goes beyond physical violence and includes psychological and economic abuse. The Act allows Clare’s Law a statutory footing, meaning that victims have a legal right to check out the offending history of their partner, and this is no longer at the police discretion.\nClare’s Law now operates in several countries across the world\nIt was first rolled out in England and Wales in 2014. Since then, versions of Clare’s Law have been introduced in Scotland (2016) and Northern Ireland (2018). Canada and Australia have also trialled similar schemes to prevent domestic abuse, which follow the original ‘right to ask’ and ‘right to know’ two-part framework.\nMarch 2021 Ottawa Ontario introduced Clare’s Law. From April 2021 Royal Canadian Mounted Police will now enforce Clare’s Law in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Newfoundland & Labrador have introduced a version of Clare’s Law call Interpersonal Violence Disclosure Protocol Act in November 2019.\nNew South Wales have introduced Clare’s Law. Has been trialled in South Australia and along with Queensland and Victoria are debating the introduction of the Disclosure Scheme. I think another page with general information would be helpful.\nWhy is it called Clare’s law?\nClare’s Law is named after Clare Wood, a 36-year old woman from Yorkshire who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton in 2009.\nShe met him on Facebook, unaware that he had a criminal history when he befriended her.\nThe pair began a 6-month relationship, which Clare finally ended after it turned coercive. However Appleton refused to move on, subjecting her to consistently abusive behaviour such as harassment, damage to property, threats of violence and attempted assault.\nThough Clare made a police statement and got a restraining order, Appleton’s behaviour continued unchecked.\nIt finally ended with him taking Clare’s life, followed by his own days after. Investigations later revealed that he had a history of violent and abusive behaviour, particularly towards women, which Greater Manchester Police were aware of but had not disclosed to Clare.\nAt the time, data protection laws had created a legal loophole which meant that former abusers were able to keep their criminal records confidential.\nThis meant potential targets like Clare had no way to check or ask police whether their partner had been similarly abusive in the past.\nFollowing her Clare’s death, her father Michael Brown began a campaign to challenge this law.\nHe believed that Clare would not have lost her life if she had been aware of Appleton’s violent past. After 5 years of campaigning, Michael eventually managed to change the law to allow police to both disclose and proactively inform people of their partners’ criminal records and relevant past convictions. Clare’s Law was finally introduced in England and Wales in 2014 under the official title of the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS).\nWho created Claire’s law?\nMichael Brown: the man and father behind Clare’s Law.\nClare’s Law was created by Michael Brown, after his daughter Clare was murdered by her ex-boyfriend.\nThe inquest into Clare’s death revealed that her ex-boyfriend had a record of violent behaviour against women, which she was not informed of due to a loophole in the Data Protection Act.\nHe campaigned for the right to know, to protect others like Clare.\nMichael believed that this knowledge could have saved Clare’s life. So he began a passionate campaign as an ambassador for other families who had also suffered a similar loss. His vision was to create a police disclosure scheme that would allow everyone the right to know of a partner’s history of violence.\nMichael’s efforts paved the way for Clare’s Law in the UK and abroad\nHe finally managed to get Clare’s Law passed in England and Wales in 2014. It was then rolled out to his birthplace Scotland in 2016, and Northern Ireland in 2018. Since then, a version of Clare’s Law has also been trialled in New South Wales, Australia, and the province of Saskatchewan in Canada.\nHis landmark campaign was recognised with a number of awards\nMichael received a number of awards recognising his efforts to raise awareness of Clare’s Law and domestic violence.

He was also appointed patron of The Endeavour Project – a Bolton-based support group for families affected by domestic abuse. Michael’s legacy continues to inspire change Sadly, Michael died in July 2020 – but his spirit continues to lives on. He was posthumously awarded the 2020 She Inspires award in the ‘He For She’ category, for male champions of gender equality. She Inspires also introduced the Michael Brown Agent Of Change award in his memory, recognising those who have also fought to right obvious wrongs.\nMichael’s lasting impact has also been widely recognised by the press:\n-‘his work has already saved hundreds of lives and believe his legacy will save thousands more’\n-‘After the best part of a decade, Clare’s Law will finally become enshrined into law as part of the Domestic Abuse Bill’\nA timeline of Michael’s campaign\n2009\n-Inquest into Clare’s murder reveals a loophole in the Data Protection Act that prevents police from sharing information about individuals with a history of violence or abuse\n-Michael joins forces with Manchester news reporter Michelle Livesey.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_starmers-betrayal-is-irreperable/content_1175.html": "Starmer’s betrayal is irreperable\nSir Keir Starmer’s approach to governance represents a fundamental departure from traditional British political philosophy, drawing a stark contrast with international counterparts such as Donald Trump’s America First stance. The divergence between these two nations, historically bound by shared values, now extends far beyond their linguistic variations to encompass a profound philosophical schism regarding the very essence of political leadership.\nThe contemporary political landscape of 2025 has evolved beyond the traditional Left-Right paradigm. Instead, we observe an emerging dichotomy between civic nationalist governments and global technocratic administrations. On one side stand robust democracies – the United States, Israel, India, and Argentina amongst them – whose elected officials maintain an unwavering commitment to their respective citizenries. The opposing camp, exemplified by Starmer’s Britain and Trudeau’s Canada, demonstrates an almost religious devotion to abstract concepts: planetary welfare, human rights, international legal frameworks, and the perpetuation of a liberal international order.\nThis philosophical divergence manifests in tangible policy decisions. The Starmer government’s approach to the Chagos situation, its precarious energy policies, and its seemingly boundless immigration strategy all stem from this fundamental ideological position. Labour’s current iteration bears little resemblance to Clement Attlee’s post-war government, which maintained a robust sense of national purpose whilst pursuing social reform.\nThe contemporary Labour administration appears to have adopted a peculiar form of inverse nationalism – not merely post-national but actively anti-national in its outlook. They operate under the conviction that prioritising British interests, even in the most measured and liberal fashion, constitutes an ethical transgression. This weltanschauung demands that British interests be perpetually subordinated to a nebulous conception of global welfare.\nThis ideological framework stems from a particular interpretation of historical responsibility. The progressive movement contends that Britain’s imperial past and industrial heritage necessitate a form of ongoing penance. This manifests in various ways: calls for the repatriation of cultural artefacts like the Elgin Marbles, acquiescence to controversial settlements such as the Gerry Adams compensation, and an immigration policy that appears to disregard economic impact assessments.\nThe government’s approach to environmental policy further exemplifies this mindset. Britain’s zealous pursuit of net-zero targets, despite the evident economic consequences and minimal global impact, demonstrates a prioritisation of symbolic gesture over practical outcome. This deontological approach to policy-making – focusing on perceived moral duty rather than consequential benefit – characterises the administration’s decision-making process.\nThe contrast becomes particularly stark when examining international relations. While other nations pursue strategic advantages – exemplified by Trump’s interest in Greenland – Britain appears willing to surrender strategic assets like the Chagos archipelago, incurring substantial financial costs in the process. This decision becomes more questionable when considering China’s growing influence in the Indian Ocean region.\nThe government’s deference to international institutions raises particular concerns. The International Court of Justice’s advisory opinions, despite their non-binding nature, are treated as sacrosanct, whilst the United Nations’ structural limitations are overlooked in favour of ideological alignment.\nThis new progressive patriotism, particularly popular among younger Britons, represents a curious inversion of traditional national pride. It celebrates Britain’s willingness to subordinate its interests to international concerns, creating a paradoxical form of exceptionalism based on national self-abnegation.\nHistorical precedent suggests such approaches rarely succeed. Canada’s experiment with post-nationalism under Trudeau and Germany’s ethical approach to immigration under Merkel both encountered significant challenges. As psychologist Gad Saad suggests in his forthcoming work on “suicidal empathy,” this prioritisation of others’ interests over national welfare may prove ultimately self-defeating.\nThe political consequences of this ideological direction remain to be seen, but historical patterns suggest a potentially significant electoral backlash. The British electorate has traditionally demonstrated limited patience with governments perceived to act against national interests, regardless of the ethical justifications offered.\nThis fundamental transformation of British political philosophy under Labour represents more than a mere policy shift – it constitutes a wholesale reorganisation of national priorities and identity. Whether this radical departure from traditional statecraft will prove sustainable in the face of mounting domestic challenges and international competition remains one of the most pressing questions in contemporary British politics.",

A recent case in which an individual was sentenced to 20 months in prison for a Facebook post has sparked debate about the limits of online expression. This article aims to explore the nuances of freedom of expression laws in the United Kingdom and the United States, drawing on expert legal analysis.\nThe Right to Freedom of Expression in the UK\nIn the United Kingdom, the right to freedom of expression is protected under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, it’s crucial to understand that this right is not absolute. The ECHR categorises rights into three types: absolute rights, limited rights, and qualified rights.\nAbsolute rights, such as the right to life, cannot be taken away under any circumstances. Limited rights, like the right to marry, have specific legal restrictions, such as age requirements. Qualified rights, which include freedom of expression under Article 10, are subject to certain conditions and limitations depending on the situation.\nThe UK’s approach to freedom of expression allows individuals to hold and express views, but there are restrictions on how these views can be manifested. This has led to several cases where individuals have faced legal consequences for posts that were deemed to cause offence, upset, or needless anxiety.\nOne notable case involved a woman named Scottow, who challenged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in the High Court. Her conviction, which stemmed from a series of tweets, was ultimately quashed. This case highlighted the interpretation of Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, which deals with improper use of public electronic communications networks.\nThe judge in Scottow’s case emphasised that Parliament did not intend to criminalise forms of expression that were merely annoying, inconvenient, or anxiety-inducing. The ruling drew a distinction between persistently sending messages with the sole purpose of annoying someone and having an extended conversation on social media that happens to annoy someone.\nHowever, it’s important to note that direct incitement to violence remains illegal under UK law. Posts that explicitly encourage attacks against individuals, groups, or properties can lead to legal consequences.\nFreedom of Speech in the United States: A Contrasting Perspective\nTo provide a comprehensive understanding of freedom of expression laws, it’s valuable to examine the approach taken in the United States. This comparison becomes particularly relevant in light of recent comments by public figures and the suggestion of potential international legal action.\nBrian Rio, an attorney at law from Ohio specialising in civil litigation and defamation cases, provided an in-depth analysis of US free speech protections. His expertise offers fascinating insights into the stark differences between UK and US approaches to freedom of expression.\nIn the US, free speech is protected under the First Amendment, which provides robust safeguards for various forms of expression. The landmark case of Brandenburg v. Ohio established that even advocacy of violence is protected, as long as it doesn’t call for immediate lawless action.\nRio’s analysis suggests that attempts to extradite individuals from the US to the UK for speech-related offences would likely fail due to the broader protections afforded by US law. He argues that comments warning about the possibility of civil unrest or even advocating for governmental change would generally be protected as core political speech in the US.\nThe US legal framework recognises several categories of speech that receive less protection, including:\n1. Advocacy of imminent lawless action\n2. Obscenity\n3. Fighting words\n4. True threats\n5. Defamatory statements\n6. Commercial speech\n7. Profane and indecent speech\nHowever, the threshold for speech to fall into these categories is often quite high, particularly when it comes to political discourse or comments on matters of public concern.\nRio provides several examples to illustrate the extent of free speech protections in the US:\n– Warnings about potential civil unrest or inevitability of conflict would likely be protected speech.\n– Even calls for extreme actions against foreign governments or public figures would generally be considered protected political speech.\n– Burning effigies or making provocative statements about foreign leaders would typically be protected as expressive conduct.\nThe concept of “true threats” is one area where speech might potentially cross the line into criminality, but Rio notes that convictions for true threats are difficult to secure, especially in the context of social media exchanges.\nImportantly, US law protects speech advocating for governmental change, even if expressed in strong terms. As long as individuals are not actively conspiring or organising to commit prohibited activities, such speech is generally protected under the First Amendment.\nImplications for International Cases\nThe stark contrast between UK and US approaches to freedom of expression has significant implications for potential international legal actions. The principle of dual criminality, which requires an act to be a crime in both the requesting and requested countries for extradition to proceed, presents a substantial hurdle in cases involving speech.\nGiven the broad protections afforded to speech in the US, it would be extremely challenging for the UK to successfully extradite an individual from the US for speech-related offences. This disparity in legal approaches effectively creates a safe haven for certain forms of expression that might be considered problematic or even criminal in the UK.\nConclusion\nThe examination of freedom of expression laws in the UK and US reveals a complex legal landscape with significant differences between the two nations. While the UK operates under a qualified right to freedom of expression, with various restrictions and potential legal consequences for certain forms of speech, the US provides much broader protections under the First Amendment.\nThese differences have important implications for individuals engaging in online discourse, particularly on platforms with a global reach. What might be considered acceptable or even protected speech in one jurisdiction could potentially lead to legal trouble in another.\nAs our world becomes increasingly interconnected through digital platforms, these legal disparities present challenges for both lawmakers and individuals navigating the complexities of international communication. It is crucial for users of social media and other online platforms to be aware of the potential legal implications of their posts, especially when engaging in discussions that cross international boundaries.\nThe ongoing debate surrounding freedom of expression in the digital age highlights the need for continued dialogue and potential re-evaluation of laws to address the realities of global communication. As technology continues to evolve, so too must our understanding and application of free speech principles in both national and international contexts.",

However, in the years between the two world wars, the UK changed its position and by the end of WWII, the UK was AGAINST the formation of a Jewish homeland in the area. In fact, the British were so against it, that in the two years after the end of the war, they were actively preventing Jews from making their way to Palestine, the Jews were rounded up by the British Army and by 1946, there were 16,00 Jews held in open prison camps in British Cyprus, that the world did not know about.\nBy 1947, the stand-off got worse. The Jews took an old ship and stripped it bare, it was named Exodus 1947, it was filled with European Jews, mainly ex-concentration camp victims, who set off from Montpellier in France, for Palestine. The Royal Navy blockaded this ship in the Mediterranean for months, the people on-board were dying of thirst but once again, the world was totally oblivious to this, until it was made public and the British Government was humiliated on the world stage and had not alternative but to let them through.\nOn the political front, the large mass of land that was British Mandate Palestine had already been divided in to Palestine for the Arabas, which was Jordan, but there was immense pressure on the British by the Arabs, NOT to allow any Jews into the area. Keep in mind that when Jordan was formed in 1946, there were Jews living there too, they were living all over the region and as new Arab nations were formed, the Jews were ethnically cleansed, their land stolen and they left with nothing.\nAfter the episode with Exodus 1947, the British had no option but to concede and the Jews were given a slither of land, and on the 14th of May 1948 the State of Israel was formed and declared independence.\nJordan immediately invaded Israel, ceasing the area we know as the West Bank and once again, the Jews were ethnically cleansed. In 1949, a ceasefire was brokered by the UN, but this was a CEASEFIRE, it was NOT a concession of land or borders, this is very important.\nWhen Israel was formed, it was formed under the international principle known as Uti Possidetis Juris, but what is that?\nThe principle of Uti Possidetis Juris is that a country is re-formed based on a previous geo-political entity. This was the same principle which was applied to the reformation of Ukraine and many of the other former Soviet states, and this is not based on ethnicity, but a political entity and Israel met all the requirements.\nIn the meantime, the Arabs who were not any one nation, but rather many different tribes, began to become nation states, but prior to this, there were no Jordanians, or Syrians, for example and the people who now identify as ‘Palestinians’ were simply a few tribes who were not even indigenous to the area, as most had migrated to the region from north and south Arabia as it was known in the the preceding decades.\nHowever, ‘Palestinians’ who were in Jordan who amounted to around 300,000 at the time, were so toxic, and engaged in so much crime, that in what became know as ‘Black September’ in 1970, Jordan deported them. As a departing gift, the recently formed Palestine Liberation Organisation then went on to assassinate the Jordanian Prime Minister in November 1971.\nJordan has maintained its position of banning ‘Palestinians’ from entering its country and in fact, they deported many more as recently as 2012!\nWhat about the principle of Juti Possidetis Juris?\nThere remained one common denominator amongst most Arabs, and that was their hate for the Jews. Just as Arabs had left the area that became Israel, Jews had also left land that was formerly Arabia, which was part of the British-French creation of new states which was set in place by the ‘League of Nations’ (the predecessor to the UN) decades earlier, but there remains one factor that seems to be lost in ignorance of international law it is this:\n- Under the principle of Juti Possedetis Juris, a country cannot occupy land that it owns.\n- Under that same principle, the borders of a country cannot be changed by aggression.\nTake a minute to think about that. The West Bank was created by the invasion of Israel by Jordan, and even though Israel agreed to the ceasefire, (Israel has agreed to every opportunity for peace and has never been the first to break it) Israel had NEVER relinquished sovereignty over the full extend of its borders, therefore, every time the BBC says that Israelis are building illegal settlements in the West Bank, they are lying!\nFurthermore, under the second principle, no matter how much its neighbours may dislike it, the borders of Israel are set in stone under international law. In fact, many of the Arab nations have now moved on and want to live in peace, but the ‘Palestinian’ hate for the Jews continues.\nWhat effect can the statement by Angela Rayner have?\nIn her haste to beg for votes, the deputy leader of the Labour Party has contradicted international law, which should have been left to the Foreign office. The mere suggestion of altering the borders of Israel actually serve to contradict the legal principle under which it was founded, and this could have wide and sinister consequences.\nIf a terrorist organisation like HAMAS and its supporters can invade, murder, rape, take hostages and summon up support from muslims around the world, who are aided and abetted by people who are completely ignorant to law, and be rewarded with a change in borders, that sets an international legal precedent.\nWhat effect would this have on the Dombas, Crimea, Transnistria, occupied Cyprus or any other nation that is occupied or who’s borders are under threat?\nWhat is the message that is being sent out to nations around the world, if they see that they can bully their neighbour and if they persist, the borders can be moved? Her reckless and ill-thought comments will inflame the situation and result in more conflict, not only in Israel, but also in other parts of the world.\nThis woman is far to irresponsible to hold the position that she may very well be holding in the near future. Peace only happens as a result of strong leadership, who clearly demonstrate the will to act against aggression, not virtue signalling hypocrites, who would sell their soul, their principles, their values and their allies for thirty pieces of Silver.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-i-have-issues-with-the-eu/content_117.html": "Why I Have Issues with the EU\nIntroduction\nIn the interests of transparency and honest debate, I think it’s only right that I step off the ledge and reveal exactly what I think about the EU. I know this is divisive – in fact, if we’re to believe everything we’re told by the media, those who voted to leave are now either dead, senile or they’ve gone to get themselves an education.\nMy Opinion on the EU\nAs far as my opinion of the EU is concerned, I have no respect for the EU whatsoever, as an institution or as an experiment. I consider it to be a dishonest, insidious, calculating, arrogant authoritarian experiment that has already failed. The only way it feeds itself is by preying on yet more nations. Now that its back is against the wall with Germany in recession, they are calling for more countries to join. They remind me of the old empire building, where the empire of the day, whichever one it may be, needed to expand in order to have more booty to plunder from new countries. This is exactly what I believe the EU is doing.\nI believe the EU answers to nobody. It has tied up the entire European Union – the member nations – in red tape and has enforced so much interdependency that these nations can’t even move. The EU can’t grow anymore because it can’t even make any trade deals. It only needs one of the countries to object and the deal is off. For example, we’ve been trying to sign the Mercosur trade pact for years but every time it’s blocked at the last minute by France, who wants to protect its own industry. In their defense, why shouldn’t they? But why should we not be able to have a trade deal to guarantee cheaper food, cheaper oil or whatever it may be just because France doesn’t want its own market to be affected? This is the problem with the EU and why it will invariably fail.\nGermany’s Energy Crisis\nGermany, the bastion of Vorsprung durch Technik, is going to be running around igniting more coal-fired power stations this winter than it has done for years. These arrogant nitwits, when they were told by a president who nobody likes that they were making a grave mistake becoming dependent on Russian gas, laughed. But to quote another smart man, they’re not laughing now, are they? Because this winter Germany is going to be kicking out more crap into our atmosphere than it has done for years through its own arrogance.\nThere was an element of calculated, misguided planning at play too, because it is my opinion that the EU were hoping the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia would give them the opportunity to manipulate their way into controlling Russian oil and gas. Unfortunately it didn’t work out that way, hence the reason that when the war first started, Germany’s contribution to Ukrainian defence was to send 500 helmets.\nThe EU’s Decline\nI think the EU will fall apart – it is inevitable – because it cannot move anymore. It is tied up in knots. All we have to consider is that back in 1970, the EU in its current size plus the UK represented 35% of global GDP. That’s when the US was only 24%. By 2022, without the UK, that had dropped to 16.5%. It was projected to be 15.5% this year and with Germany plunging into recession, that is being revised down to below 15%. On its current trajectory, by the end of this decade the EU will represent less than 10% of global GDP.\nWho in their right mind would want to be confined to a dying, corrupt, authoritarian regime? But that’s not the real reason I have issues with the EU, or rather, not the only reason.\nGermany’s Manipulation\nLet’s go back to the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1989. Later that year, the fall of the Berlin Wall bankrupted Germany through the cost of reunification. Then we had Black Wednesday in 1992 which cost this country billions because we were tied into the ERM. You’d have thought that would have opened people’s eyes but it didn’t. People like Soros made billions on the back of misery in this country. Following Black Wednesday, Norman Lamont decided to pull us out of the ERM.\nTwo years later in 1995, Germany championed the entry of Turkey as a trading partner with the EU. This meant Turkey could manufacture goods outside the EU without any restrictions, health and safety obligations or other EU country requirements. But those goods could be imported into the EU without tariffs because Germany decided to outsource a lot of its manufacturing to its old friend. Let’s not forget that Turkey, as the Ottomans, sided with the Germans and Austro-Hungarians in World War I. They remained neutral in World War II and Turkey has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey itself.\nSo Germany decided to outsource everything to its old friend and make its old friend an associate member. What that meant though is Turkey then slowly undercut all the textile industries across Southern Europe – Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus. Within 5 years, all of their textile industry, give or take, had gone. Their economies have been ravaged in a way they have never recovered from.\nThe Euro’s Introduction\nThe next step came in 1998 when Germany entered the Euro, which was a digital currency for just 3 years before it was introduced as a physical currency. Germany entered approximately 10-15% undervalued. The Deutschmark went in 10-15% lower, giving Germany a competitive advantage over its neighbours.\nBasically, Germany – the instigator of the Euro – shafted its neighbours by setting its exchange rate in stone at a lower rate to give itself a competitive advantage. The other countries then made up the shortfall in what they were buying from Germany by borrowing from Germany. Deutsche Bank stepped in and began lending to Germany’s neighbours.\nFast forward 5-10 years and Portugal, Spain, Greece and countries around Italy were all in serious debt to Deutsche Bank. Once it plunged countries like Greece into extreme debt and was worried it might lose some money, Deutsche Bank sold off a lot of those bonds. After selling off lots of them, it then devalued them and wiped out the people who had bought them – which included other smaller countries.\nConclusion\nWho in their right mind would want these people to make decisions about our country after a history of manipulation, currency tricks and debt schemes? The EU is a failed experiment that has ravaged European economies for its own gain. It’s time for Britain to fully free itself from this tangled web.\nSummary and Key Points\n– The EU is a failed authoritarian experiment that has tied member states in bureaucratic knots and damaged economies like Greece through debt schemes.\n– Germany has repeatedly manipulated the EU and European economies to its advantage, such as with the Euro conversion rate and outsourcing manufacturing to Turkey.\n– The EU share of global GDP has plunged from 35% to below 15% and will likely fall below 10% this decade as it declines in relevance.\n– The EU cannot accomplish trade deals due to requiring agreement from all members. This inaction will contribute to its downfall.\n– Russia’s war on Ukraine exposed the EU’s vulnerability and overreliance on Russian energy. The EU attempted to gain control of Russian resources but failed.\n– Arrogant EU energy policy has forced Germany to reopen coal plants, despite warnings from experts. This winter will see significant emissions as a result.\n– The EU craves new member states to plunder as its power dwindles. Britain made the right decision escaping before being drained fully.\n– The EU has ravaged economies in southern Europe through currency manipulation and debt schemes. It operates only in its own interest.\n– The EU lacks transparency and answers to no one. Complete authority with no accountability is a recipe for corruption.\n– In summary, the EU experiment has failed and fallen far short of its promised prosperity. The path forward is for Britain to fully cut ties and determine its own future.",

Cyprus’s geographic position has caused Cyprus to be influenced by differing Eastern Mediterranean civilisations over the millennia.\nPeriods of Cyprus’s history from 1050 BC have been named according to styles of pottery found as follows:\n- Cypro-Geometric I: 1050-950 BC\n- Cypro-Geometric II: 950-850 BC\n- Cypro-Geometric III: 850-700 BC\n- Cypro-Archaic I: 700-600 BC\n- Cypro-Archaic II: 600-475 BC\n- Cypro-Classical I: 475-400 BC\n- Cypro-Classical II: 400-323 BC\nPrehistoric Cyprus\nCyprus was settled by humans in the Paleolithic period (known as the stone age) who coexisted with various dwarf animal species, such as dwarf elephants (Elephas cypriotes) and pygmy hippos (Hippopotamus minor) well into the Holocene. There are claims of an association of this fauna with artifacts of Epipalaeolithic foragers at Aetokremnos near Limassol on the southern coast of Cyprus. The first undisputed settlement occurred in the 9th (or perhaps 10th) millennium BC from the Levant. The first settlers were agriculturalists of the so-called PPNB (pre-pottery Neolithic B) era, but did not yet produce pottery (aceramic Neolithic).\nThe dog, sheep, goats and possibly cattle and pigs were introduced, as well as numerous wild animals such as foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos) and cultivated einkorn and emmer. Pigs, sheep, goats and cattle were kept but remained, for the most part, behaviourally wild. Evidence of cattle such as that attested at Shillourokambos is rare, and when they apparently died out in the course of the 8th millennium they were not re-introduced until the ceramic Neolithic.\nIn the 6th millennium BC, the aceramic Khirokitia culture was characterised by roundhouses, stone vessels and an economy based on sheep, goats and pigs. Cattle were unknown, and Persian fallow deer were hunted. This was followed by the ceramic Sotira phase. The Eneolithic era is characterised by stone figurines with spread arms.\nKhirokitia archeological site\nWater wells discovered by archaeologists in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world, dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old, putting them in the Stone Age. They are said to show the sophistication of early settlers, and their heightened appreciation for the environment.\nIn 2004, the remains of an 8-month-old cat were discovered buried with its human owner at a Neolithic archeological site in Cyprus. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, predating Egyptian civilization and pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly.\nBronze Age\nIn the Bronze Age the first cities, such as Enkomi, were built. Systematic copper mining began, and this resource was widely traded. Mycenaean Greeks were undoubtedly inhabiting Cyprus from the late stage of the Bronze Age, while the island’s Greek name is already attested from the 15th century BC in the Linear B script.\nThe Cypriot syllabic script was first used in early phases of the late Bronze Age (LCIB) and continued in use for ca. 500 years into the LC IIIB, maybe up to the second half of the eleventh century BC. Most scholars believe it was used for a native Cypriot language (Eteocypriot) that survived until the 4th century BC, but the actual proofs for this are scant, as the tablets still have not been completely deciphered.\nThe LCIIC (1300–1200 BC) was a time of local prosperity. Cities such as Enkomi were rebuilt on a rectangular grid plan, where the town gates correspond to the grid axes and numerous grand buildings front the street system or newly founded. Great official buildings constructed from ashlar masonry point to increased social hierarchisation and control. Some of these buildings contain facilities for processing and storing olive oil, such as Maroni-Vournes and Building X at Kalavassos-Ayios Dhimitrios. A Sanctuary with a horned altar constructed from ashlar masonry has been found at Myrtou-Pigadhes, other temples have been located at Enkomi, Kition and Kouklia (Palaepaphos). Both the regular layout of the cities and the new masonry techniques find their closest parallels in Syria, especially in Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra). Rectangular corbelled tombs point to close contacts with Syria and Palestine as well.\nThe practice of writing spread and tablets in the Cypriot syllabic script have been found at Ras Shamra which was the Phoenician city of Ugarit. Ugaritic texts from Ras Shamra and Enkomi mention Ya, the Assyrian name of Cyprus, that thus seems to have been in use already in the late Bronze Age.\nCopper ingots shaped like oxhides have been recovered from shipwrecks such as at Ulu Burun, Iria and Cape Gelidonya which attest to the widespread metal trade. Weights in the shape of animals found in Enkomi and Kalavassos follow the Syro-Palestinian, Mesopotamian, Hittite and Aegean standards and thus attest to the wide-ranging trade as well.\nLate Bronze Age Cyprus was a part of the Hittite empire but was a client state and as such was not invaded but rather merely part of the empire by association and governed by the ruling kings of Ugarit. As such Cyprus was essentially “left alone with little intervention in Cypriot affairs”. However, during the reign of Tudhaliya, the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites for either reasons of securing the copper resource or as a way of preventing piracy. Shortly afterwards the island was reconquered by his son around 1200 BC.\nAlthough Achaean Greeks were living in Cyprus from the 14th century, most of them inhabited the island after the Trojan war. Achaeans were colonizing Cyprus from 1210 to 1000 BC. Dorian Greeks arrived around 1100 BC and, unlike the pattern on the Greek mainland, the evidence suggests that they settled on Cyprus peacefully.\nAnother wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place in the following century (LCIIIB, 1100–1050), indicated, among other things, by a new type of graves (long dromoi) and Mycenaean influences in pottery decoration.\nPottery\nIn the later phase of the late Bronze Age (LCIIIA, 1200–1100 BC) great amounts of ‘Mycenaean’ IIIC:1b pottery were produced locally. New architectural features include cyclopean walls, found on the Greek mainland, as well and a certain type of rectangular stepped capitals, endemic on Cyprus. Chamber tombs are given up in favour of shaft graves. Large amounts of IIIC:1b pottery are found in Palestine during this period as well. While this was formerly interpreted as evidence of an invasion (‘Sea Peoples’), this is seen more and more as an indigenous development, triggered by increasing trade relations with Cyprus and Crete. Evidence of early trade with Crete is found in archaeological recovery on Cyprus of pottery from Cydonia, a powerful urban centre of ancient Crete.\nCypriot city kingdoms\nMost authors claim that the Cypriot city kingdoms, first described in written sources in the 8th century BC were already founded in the 11th century BC. Other scholars see a slow process of increasing social complexity between the 12th and the 8th centuries, based on a network of chiefdoms. In the 8th century (geometric period) the number of settlements increases sharply and monumental tombs, like the ‘Royal’ tombs of Salamis appear for the first time. This could be a better indication for the appearance of the Cypriot kingdoms\nEarly Iron Age\nThe early Iron Age on Cyprus follows the Submycenaean period (1125–1050 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. It is divided into the Geometric (1050–700), and Archaic (700–525) periods.\nFoundations myths documented by classical authors connect the foundation of numerous Cypriot towns with immigrant Greek heroes in the wake of the Trojan war. For example, Teucer, brother of Aias was supposed to have founded Salamis, and the Arcadian Agapenor of Tegea to have replaced the native ruler Kinyras and to have founded Paphos. Some scholars see this a memory of a Greek colonisation already in the 11th century. In the 11th century tomb 49 from Palaepaphos-Skales three bronze obeloi with inscriptions in Cypriot syllabic script have been found, one of which bears the name of Opheltas. This is first indication of the use of Greek language on the island.\nCremation as a burial rite is seen as a Greek introduction as well. The first cremation burial in Bronze vessels has been found at Kourion-Kaloriziki, tomb 40, dated to the first half of the 11th century (LCIIIB). The shaft grave contained two bronze rod tripod stands, the remains of a shield and a golden sceptre as well. Formerly seen as the Royal grave of first Argive founders of Kourion, it is now interpreted as the tomb of a native Cypriot or a Phoenician prince. The cloisonné enamelling of the sceptre head with the two falcons surmounting it has no parallels in the Aegean, but shows a strong Egyptian influence.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_britain-sees-largest-immigration-surge-among-wealthy-nations/content_639.html": "Britain Sees Largest Immigration Surge Among Wealthy Nations\nNew OECD Data Shows UK Immigration Rose Over 50% in 2023\nAccording to the latest analysis from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Kingdom experienced the most significant surge in immigration among wealthy nations last year. In 2023, the UK welcomed 746,900 new “permanent-type” migrants, a 52.9% increase from 488,400 arrivals in 2022.\nThis sharp rise in immigration outpaced all other OECD member countries. The only other country seeing anywhere near the UK’s level of immigration growth was South Korea, which reported a 50.9% jump to 87,100 new permanent arrivals.\nThe UK also recorded the second-highest number of overall immigrant arrivals behind only the United States, which saw 1.2 million new permanent residents in 2023.\nThese figures will likely increase pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour government to address their campaign promise of “properly controlling and managing” immigration levels. Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, criticised the “exploding population” and argued that mass immigration is making the country “poorer” for most citizens, despite potential benefits for large employers.\nThe OECD analysis shows the flow of immigrants to Britain has more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels, rising by 110%. This was one of the sharpest increases among OECD nations, surpassed only by New Zealand (where arrivals more than tripled), Lithuania, and Poland.\nThe OECD’s definition of “permanent-type” migration typically includes workers and their family members but excludes international students and temporary residents like Ukrainian refugees. In the UK’s case, the OECD noted a 60% increase in “family migration”, with 373,000 new family members joining labour migrants in 2023. Around 70% of these family migrants were accompanying relatives of skilled workers.\nIndians were the most common nationality among foreign-born people moving permanently to the UK last year, followed by Nigerians and Chinese. Separate figures also revealed that 7 million foreign-born workers are now employed in the UK, a record high, while the number of British-born employees remains over 800,000 below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe OECD warned that these high immigration flows across the wealthy world have “fuelled widespread concern” about migrants’ economic and social impacts, making immigration management a top political priority for 2024 elections. Mr Farage called for the government to aim for “net zero migration” to stop population growth through immigration.\nOverall, the data underscores the significant demographic shifts occurring in the UK, with immigration playing an increasingly central role. As the political debates around these issues continue, policymakers will likely face growing pressure to address public concerns while also managing the economic and social factors driving these immigration trends.",

A suitcase with the remains of a woman was found at the bottom a week ago.\nSeveral hundred people gathered at the site Sunday to light candles and lay flowers in memory of the two first victims, both of whom were from the Philippines. Some wept as tributes to the two victims were read.\nA coroner will examine the remains found Sunday to try to identify the victim, police spokesman Andreas Angelides said. Divers are scouring the lake bottom with a sophisticated sonar device for another suitcase, Fire Service Chief Marcos Trangolas said.\nThe search for bodies and evidence started weeks ago in a case that has shocked the eastern Mediterranean island nation, brought allegations of police negligence, and cost the country’s justice minister and the police chief their jobs.\nPolice have been accused of failing to properly investigate when a victim was reported missing 2½ years ago, allowing the suspect to keep killing. Several of the women were reported as missing to police.\nEarlier Sunday, Criminal Investigation Department Chief Neophytos Shailos told a court in Nicosia that the suspect allegedly raped a woman in early 2017 after he picked her up in his car, saying he wanted to give her the photographs he took. Shailos said the suspect recorded video on his cellphone.\nThe woman, a 19-year-old foreign citizen, called the suspect’s wife at the time and told her what had happened, Shailos said. He did not elaborate on what the suspect’s wife did with that information. The couple, who have two children, are now divorced.\nShailos said investigators are trying to secure additional testimony from a female friend of the alleged victim, who has since left the island. He did not state her nationality.\nThe court on Sunday extended the suspect’s detention for another eight days. He has not been named because he has not yet been charged in what authorities are calling the most horrifying multiple-slayings case that Cyprus has seen.\nThe suspect, who represented himself in court Sunday and wore a bulletproof vest, said he had no objections to the detention renewal.\nInvestigators have been speaking with everyone the suspect had contacted online since 2016, when the alleged first victims vanished: Livia Florentina Bunea, 36, from Romania; and her 8-year-old daughter, Elena Natalia Bunea.\nOnly two of the victims have so far been positively identified; 38-year-old Mary Rose Tiburcio and Arian Palanas Lozano, 28, both from the Philippines. Their bodies were discovered in an abandoned mineshaft last month six days apart.\nAuthorities are also looking for the body of Tiburcio’s 6-year-old daughter Sierra in another reservoir. The decomposed remains of a woman who is believed to be Ashita Khadka Bista, from Nepal, were found at the bottom of a pit in a military firing range after the suspect led investigators there.\nCyprus President Nicos Anastasiades, who on Saturday called the suspect a “serial killer,” last week apologized to diplomats of the countries of the victims and vowed to bolster protections for foreign workers in Cyprus.\nCritics claim the police in Cyprus did not put much energy into the missing persons reports because the victims were low-paid foreign workers.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_eu-planning-to-expand-into-ukraine/content_43.html": "EU planning to expand into Ukraine\nAccess Would Provide Economic Boost to War-Torn Country on Path to Bloc Membership\nUrsula von der Leyen is preparing to push European Union regulations to their “breaking point” to provide Ukraine with privileged access to the bloc’s Single Market as a component of a final peace agreement, The Telegraph can exclusively reveal.\nThe lucrative access to a market comprising 449 million consumers would deliver a desperately needed economic boost to assist in rebuilding the war-ravaged nation, which currently holds candidate country status for EU membership.\nUnder the proposed scheme, Brussels would selectively determine which sectors to open to Kyiv and which to maintain as restricted. This approach represents a significant policy shift for the European Commission.\nCentral to the strategy is Ukraine’s flourishing defence industry, which is currently producing substantial quantities of cutting-edge drone technology and provides approximately 55 per cent of the weaponry utilised by its armed forces.\nTariff-free access for Ukrainian armaments would generate crucial revenue for Kyiv, whilst simultaneously enhancing the military capabilities of EU member states that are urgently seeking to increase defence expenditure and manufacturing capacity in response to regional security concerns.\nAt a summit convened in Brussels on Thursday, EU leaders endorsed a comprehensive plan to mobilise €800 billion in defence investment, signalling their commitment to strengthening European security infrastructure.\nDuring previous Brexit negotiations, Brussels had cautioned Britain against attempting to “cherry pick” access to the Single Market without accepting the full obligations associated with EU membership, such as freedom of movement for citizens. This apparent policy reversal for Ukraine indicates the strategic importance Brussels places on supporting the embattled nation.\n“It’s already progressing in that direction,” a senior EU official disclosed to The Telegraph, when questioned whether the European Commission president was prepared to extend EU regulations to their limit for Ukraine’s benefit.\nIdeally, these proposals would constitute the EU’s contribution to a final peace settlement; however, they are not contingent upon an agreement being reached, as the exchange of Single Market access for armaments will accelerate Ukraine’s eventual integration into the bloc.\nOne EU diplomat pointedly observed that Ukraine’s objective was to join the EU rather than leave it, and that former US President Donald Trump’s initiation of peace discussions with Russia without Kyiv’s involvement meant the “world had changed” with respect to geopolitical realities.\n“Cherry-picking in this context is acceptable, provided we are the ones determining which cherries are to be picked,” the diplomat remarked, before predicting that the initiative would receive favourable responses from the majority of member states.\n“In the defence sector, Ukraine has substantial contributions to make. The integration of its highly innovative and thriving defence industry, with its demonstrated capacity to scale production, could serve as a catalyst for a significantly more integrated European defence market,” stated Marta Kos, the EU’s commissioner for enlargement.\n“We are additionally developing strategies to accelerate Ukraine’s integration into numerous additional segments of the Single Market – to attract increased investment, to strengthen Europe-wide value chains, and to create new opportunities for both Ukrainian and European enterprises. This will function as a stepping stone to expedite the reconstruction of Ukraine,” she elaborated in a speech delivered this week.\nThe bloc has already implemented measures to connect Ukraine’s electricity market to the EU grid and will pursue deeper integration across the broader energy market, ensuring greater stability and security in Europe’s energy supply.\nOpening Ukraine’s services sector to European markets has been actively considered, with Kyiv representing a significant exporter of IT services and products, boasting the largest concentration of outsourced developers in Eastern Europe. This could potentially transform the digital landscape across the continent, creating new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.\nUkrainian agricultural exports were granted tariff-free status following the Russian invasion, providing a vital economic lifeline for the country’s farming sector. However, extending the EU’s comprehensive agricultural subsidies to Ukraine is understood to be excluded from current discussions, primarily due to budgetary constraints and concerns from existing agricultural powerhouses within the bloc.\nBrussels has also extended mobile phone roaming privileges without additional charges for Ukrainians who have been displaced, eliminating extra costs for those who fled to other European countries. This measure has proven particularly beneficial for maintaining communication networks for refugees scattered across the continent.\nUkrainian citizens already benefit from a form of freedom of movement within the EU, thanks to regulations granting them temporary protection status. These provisions enable the approximately four million Ukrainians who have sought refuge to enjoy residence rights, educational access for children, and labour market opportunities without the requirement to apply for asylum through conventional channels.\nNevertheless, EU officials have emphasised that assessments of Ukraine’s progress towards full membership would remain entirely merit-based, adhering to the established criteria for accession. This assurance aims to maintain the integrity of the accession process while acknowledging Ukraine’s unique circumstances.\nJoining the European Union entails a lengthy and challenging process, requiring candidate countries to adopt extensive portions of European legislation and frequently embark upon difficult structural reforms to align their governance, economic, and legal systems with EU standards.\nForecasting the timeline for a country’s accession is notoriously difficult. Albania, for instance, has been awaiting membership for more than a decade and maintains hopes of being granted entry by 2030, despite significant progress in meeting accession criteria.\nUkraine has expressed aspirations to achieve membership by 2028, but experts and officials describe this timeline as unrealistic given the comprehensive nature of required reforms and the current state of conflict. In the interim, Brussels is exploring avenues to extend as many membership benefits to Kyiv as legally permissible, creating a pathway for gradual integration.\nHowever, this preferential approach carries the risk of causing discontent among other candidate countries, particularly those in the Western Balkans, who have not received comparable treatment despite years of pursuing accession. Countries such as North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia have expressed concerns about perceived double standards in the accession process.\nThe European Commission must therefore balance its strategic support for Ukraine with maintaining credible enlargement policies for all candidate countries, ensuring that exceptional measures for Ukraine do not undermine the broader integrity of the EU’s expansion framework. This delicate balancing act will test the EU’s diplomatic abilities as it navigates competing priorities and historical commitments.\nAs the conflict in Ukraine continues, the EU’s approach represents an innovative attempt to provide tangible support without compromising its fundamental principles. By selectively opening specific sectors of the Single Market, Brussels hopes to deliver immediate economic benefits while maintaining the incentive structure for comprehensive reforms required for full membership.\nThe success of this strategy will ultimately depend on its implementation details, the response from other candidate countries, and Ukraine’s ability to capitalise on the opportunities presented while continuing to progress toward meeting all membership criteria.\nComment\nThis is utter madness, once again the EU is demonstrating that it continues to use expansion as a method for survival, regardless of the consequences to existing members, not to mention that fact that this is yet another provocation of Russia.\nCrops from Ukraine, which are not subject to the same regulations as EU crops, have been undercutting farmers within Europe and putting them out of business, but the EU is not concerned, as long as they are able to expand their unelected club and draw more countries into their calculated clutches.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-best-laptop-for-writers/content_313.html": "The best laptop for writers\nFor those of us who have a passion for writing, the right keyboard is of paramount importance. As someone who was a child before the age of computers, (yes, there are still lots of us around) I never learned to type properly, boys were never taught to type in the 70s, so I always typed in the same manner as anyone else in the same boat, something alone the lines of an excited Chimpanzee.\nDuring the lockdown, I took the decision that this needed to change, because it was holding me back and as I wanted to write more posts, a book and generally be able to conduct my business in a more efficient manner, I took the decision that I needed to start from the very beginning.\nI started off with working through the lessons on an online typing website, f,j,f,j,f,j,f,j,f,j, etc. At this point, I was not only trying to build up muscle memory, but I also needed to overcome over three decades of bad habits, not an easy task. I gradually worked through the lessons and by the end, I was able to touch type, whilst keeping my eyes off of the keyboard, albeit slowly. I then moved on to a website called ‘Keyber’ which is absolutely wonderful as it takes you through words (both real and fabricated) that will exercise every letter of the alphabet in turn.\nAfter more than fifty hours of training and 5,000+ lessons, I have managed to reach an average of over sixty words per minute. There are also stats that show how your typing and accuracy have improved. I still have a long way to go, but I make a point of completing several lessons each and every day, normally when I’m on the phone!\nThat’s all well and good, but I spend a lot of my time working on my laptop, which is a Lenovo Thinkpad, in my opinion, the most beautiful, comfortable and easiest keyboard to use that I have ever tried. However, I also do a lot of work at my pc and finding a keyboard that would pair up with this has been a nightmare. I have bought a total of twelve keyboards and none of them even come close to the Thinkpad.\nWhen I was going to upgrade my laptop recently, I tried to actually get a feel for the keyboard of as many laptops as possible, not an easy task when so many of the suppliers are now online only. In the first instance, I popped in to PC World, and tried everything, including all of the Apple products.\nWhat did surprise me about the Macbooks, was the fact that they are not available with a UK Keyboard! After thousands of lessons, learning to type, I was not about to even consider a keyboard with some of the most important keys in the wrong place! I also do not like the spacing of the keys, or the lack of tactile feel when they are depressed. I’m sorry to disappoint Macbook fans, but I actually dislike the keyboards and I would never even consider any of them.\nMost of the other laptops have similar keys, with very little travel, terrible feel to them and none of them even come close to the Thinkpad. The keys have a wonderful feel, with just enough travel to give a wonderful reassuring response to the typist. There is one small caveat, which is that the Ctrl and Fn keys are reversed, but that is a small price to pay. The Thinkpad keyboards are also backlit, either low or high and one further press of the Fn + Spacebar, turns on a light just below the camera, which illuminates the whole keyboard, perfect for those late night writing binges!\nAs for my PC keyboard, I bought a Dell Premiere keyboard, which has a beautiful Aluminium construction, it literally oozes quality, but sadly the keys are still no match for the Thinkpad, but I could not keep buying keyboards, my office looks like a computer shop. I do also have a Logitch keyboard that has the old fashioned scissor keys, but they are not quite as deep as the older keyboards. I sometimes switch to that one when I am writing something the evokes passion and I feel the need for a keyboard that I am able to actually strike with a vengeance, making the entire experience, ‘oh so satisfying’\nThinpads are not cheap, as they are designed for business use, constructed to the highest quality, they can even be dropped from desk height and normally survive in tact. Having tried every option that I was able to physically test, I am able to say without any reservation, that the only keyboard for me, is the Thinkpad.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_europes-economic-decline/content_345.html": "Europe’s Economic Decline\nHow the EU fell behind US – What’s Behind the EU’s Struggles?\nEurope once represented a bastion of economic strength and stability, with high standards of living, strong productivity growth, and a robust social safety net. However, in recent decades, the European economy has fallen behind countries like the United States and China. Europe has struggled with low growth, high unemployment, debt crises, political fragmentation, and now faces deep uncertainties from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. What explains Europe’s economic travails? In this blog, I summarise the key factors discussed in a video on Europe’s economic decline.\nThe Post-War Boom Ends\nIn the post-war decades, Europe, and especially countries like Germany, enjoyed an economic “miracle” with rapid catch-up growth. European integration via the EU single market in the 1990s brought down barriers and boosted trade and investment. Standards of living converged towards American levels.\nHowever, this momentum has faded over the past 20 years. Whilst sporadic shocks like the Great Recession, euro debt crisis, Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic all delivered blows, more deep-rooted problems around demographics, lack of technological leadership, excessive regulation and flawed policy choices have hobbled Europe.\nThe Perils of Austerity\nMuch of Europe embraced fiscal austerity after the 2010 euro zone debt crisis, prioritising deficit and debt reduction over growth. However, spending cuts and tax hikes often proved counter-productive, dampening demand and recovery. For example, Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio still soared from 115% to over 150% despite austerity efforts. Slower growth shrinks the tax base, offsetting any savings.\nAusterity has been especially painful for crisis-hit countries like Italy and Greece that saw wage declines and brain drain. But even powerhouses like Germany have adopted excessively tight budgets. Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has been a vocal critic of European austerity.\nDemographic Headwinds\nAn aging population is another brake on European growth. Low birth rates and limited immigration mean that Europe’s workforce is shrinking. An older population saves less, invests less and is less entrepreneurial. Rising health and pension costs are also a fiscal burden.\nWhilst female labour participation and migration helped offset aging in the past, today anti-immigrant sentiment has taken hold. Europe’s median age is now the highest in the world. An aging society was a key factor behind Japan’s growth struggles. This demographic challenge will be extremely difficult for Europe to navigate.\nLagging on Technology and Innovation\nEurope has so far missed out on the big tech revolution that propelled the growth of companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple. The EU only accounts for 4% of the world’s tech “unicorns” (start-ups valued over $1 billion) whilst the US claims over 50%. Stringent regulations like GDPR have not dented big tech’s dominance.\nAreas like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, computer chips and batteries are also led by the US and China. Europe spends less on R&D and its markets often lack the scale and dynamism to nurture world-beating tech champions. Even Germany’s mighty auto sector is losing ground to American and Chinese rivals.\nOver-Regulation in Germany\nGermany long served as Europe’s growth locomotive. However, its economy has stagnated, with declining competitiveness in traditional strongholds like cars, machinery and chemicals. Economists argue Germany suffers from excessive red tape and planning lags. Obtaining permits takes 50% longer than the OECD average. Outdated regulations also hinder adoption of digital technologies.\nGermany’s abandonment of nuclear power has left it heavily exposed to Russian gas imports. The surge in energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has hit both German industry and Europe’s economy. Reorienting to renewable energy will be costly and difficult.\nProblems with the Euro\nThe euro currency union brought benefits like lower transaction costs but also imposed strains. Interest rates and policies set by the European Central Bank have at times been too loose or tight for individual countries.\nLacking currency flexibility, countries within Europe have struggled to adjust to asymmetric shocks. When the 2008 crisis hit, southern European countries were plunged into debt crises as bond yields spiked, resulting in harsh austerity programs. The crisis exposed cracks in the euro zone’s architecture that linger today.\nSilver Linings?\nRecent shocks like the pandemic, Ukraine war and energy crisis have admittedly hit Europe hard. But looking ahead, if managed properly, these upheavals could potentially help accelerate overdue reforms and investments.\nFor example, the Ukraine crisis and supply chain bottlenecks have spotlighted Europe’s over-reliance on imports from Asia. Reshoring manufacturing and building domestic technology supply chains could boost jobs and growth. The green energy transition also offers huge opportunities if climate investments are ramped up intelligently.\nEurope Less Dire in Some Respects\nWhile Europe clearly faces stiff economic headwinds, some statistics should be viewed carefully. For example, US GDP per capita exceeds the EU, but Americans also work substantially longer hours. Europeans enjoy more leisure time.\nMeasured in dollar terms, EU productivity has fallen behind the US. However, adjusted for local costs and living standards (purchasing power parity), EU productivity has kept pace or even exceeded the US per hour worked.\nThe 50% drop in the euro’s value over the past decade also complicates direct comparisons. So whilst Europe undoubtedly faces lacklustre growth and painful adjustments, talk of terminal decline or irrelevance seems premature.\nDemographic Destiny?\nEurope’s rapidly aging population is perhaps the thorniest challenge. With low fertility rates, shrinking workforces are bound to act as a perennial drag on growth. Combined with rising public spending pressures, Europe’s demographic destiny could blunt the impact of any reforms.\nCounteracting demographic headwinds through rising migration would require confronting deep-set political opposition. Even with enlightened policies, Europe’s relative weight in the global economy seems poised to gradually ebb.",

While the report acknowledges that the Home Office has reduced the number of hotels used for migrant accommodation, it states that the move to establish larger sites has incurred substantial losses.\nDavid Hak, a prominent human rights lawyer, lambasted the findings of the report, describing it as “52 pages of evidence of utter incompetence.” The figures revealed in the report are indeed breathtaking, with instances of gross overspending and budgeting miscalculations. For example, the site at Scampton, initially budgeted at £5 million, ended up costing a whopping £46-49 million – a clear indication of the chaos and mismanagement plaguing the system.\nIn an interview, Hak expressed his frustration with the government’s handling of the asylum seeker crisis. “It’s an absolute chaos,” he exclaimed, highlighting the lack of understanding and preparedness on the part of the Home Office, as cited in the NAO report: “The Home Office did not understand the challenges it faced.”\nThe report’s findings have reignited the debate surrounding the UK’s treatment of asylum seekers and the government’s ability to manage the influx of migrants effectively. While some argue that the UK is using asylum seekers and illegal migrants as scapegoats for broader societal problems, others contend that the issue lies in the inability to process applications promptly and efficiently.\nHak, who represents genuine asylum seekers, recounted the case of a young woman from Sai who had been waiting for over a year and a half for her application to be processed – a clear violation of the system’s intended purpose. “Even on the face of it, it really shouldn’t have been,” he lamented, suggesting that her case was rushed through to meet targets, leading to an unjust rejection.\nThe crux of the problem, according to Hak and others, is the lack of an effective processing system. “We should be able to process applications in this country in a couple of weeks if we put the right resources on,” he asserted, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the system to separate genuine asylum seekers from those without valid claims.\nIn response to the report, a Home Office spokesperson stated, “We’ve always been clear that the use of asylum hotels is unacceptable, which is why we acted swiftly to reduce the impact on local communities. While the NAO’s figures include setup costs, it’s currently better value for money for the taxpayer to continue with these sites than to use hotels.”\nAs the debate rages on, it is clear that the UK’s approach to addressing the migrant crisis requires a significant overhaul, with a focus on efficiency, transparency, and a commitment to upholding human rights standards. The NAO report serves as a stark reminder of the systemic failures and financial mismanagement plaguing the current system, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive reform.\nSummary\n• National Audit Office report shows government’s plans for larger migrant housing sites to cost £1.2 billion, much more than using hotels\n• Report highlights incompetence, overspending, and budgeting issues by the Home Office\n– E.g. Site at Scampton budgeted for £5m but ended up costing £46-49m\n• Human rights lawyer David Hak calls report evidence of “utter incompetence” and “absolute chaos”\n• Lack of effective processing system means genuine asylum seekers face long delays\n– One case cited of asylum seeker from Sai waiting over 1.5 years\n• Hak says applications should be processed within a couple weeks with proper resources\n• Home Office defends use of larger sites as better value than hotels currently\n• Calls for comprehensive reform of “unfit for purpose” system to uphold human rights and manage migration properly\nWe did not vote for this, we cannot afford this and we do not want this!!!",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-labours-economic-plans-are-doomed/content_1137.html": "Why Labour’s Economic Plans are Doomed!\nLabour’s Economic Vision: A Critical Analysis of Rachel Reeves and ‘Secure Economics’\nAs Britain enters 2025, questions persist about the economic direction under Labour’s leadership, particularly focusing on Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her approach to managing Britain’s economy. This analysis examines the foundations of Labour’s economic strategy and its implementation challenges in the current climate.\nThe Evolution of Rachel Reeves: From ‘Rachel from Accounts’ to Economic Architect\nThe journey of Rachel Reeves to her position as Chancellor of the Exchequer has been marked by controversy and scrutiny, particularly regarding her credentials and experience. Initial public attention focused on discrepancies in her curriculum vitae, which claimed a decade at the Bank of England when she had served for six years, with significant periods spent pursuing further education at the London School of Economics. Her master’s degree, while respectable with a merit classification, was essentially an extension of undergraduate-level coursework rather than advanced economic theory.\nThe private sector experience outlined in her CV also faced questioning, particularly her role at HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland), where her position was reportedly in customer relations rather than as an economist. These revelations painted a picture of someone more focused on political advancement than economic expertise.\nLiterary Endeavours and Academic Concerns\nReeves’s attempts to establish herself as an author and intellectual have also faced criticism. Her most recent work, “The Women Who Made Modern Economics,” published in October 2023, attracted attention not for its insights but for containing at least twenty instances of direct plagiarism, primarily from Wikipedia and The Guardian. This academic impropriety might have been dismissed as merely embarrassing, were it not for the book’s deeper significance in revealing Labour’s economic thinking.\nThe Guardian’s Review: Unveiling Labour’s Economic Framework\nA crucial turning point in understanding Labour’s economic strategy came through The Guardian’s review of Reeves’s book. Rather than treating it as merely a collection of biographies, the review identified it as outlining “a coherent political project” – essentially Labour’s economic manifesto. The book’s final chapter, focusing on US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, proved particularly revealing about Labour’s economic thinking.\nThe Yellen Connection: Modern Supply-Side Economics\nReeves’s admiration for Yellen, whom she described as “Keynesian to her fingertips,” provides a crucial insight into Labour’s economic approach. The connection goes beyond mere admiration – Labour’s pre-election economic policy appears to have been heavily influenced by Yellen’s “modern supply-side economics,” introduced at Davos in January 2021.\nYellen’s approach contrasted with traditional supply-side economics, which emphasised deregulation and tax cuts to promote private capital investment. Instead, she advocated for prioritising:\n– Labour supply\n– Human capital development\n– Public infrastructure investment\n– Research and development\n– Sustainable environmental investments\nThe American Experience: Context and Contrast\nThe Biden administration’s implementation of these policies, initially branded as “Build Back Better” and later repackaged as the Inflation Reduction Act, provided a testing ground for modern supply-side economics. While the American economy showed growth, it came at significant cost: inflation reached 8%, and government debt servicing now consumes approximately 20% of federal expenditure. Crucially, America’s ability to sustain such policies relies heavily on the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.\nBritish Adaptation: ‘Secure Economics’\nReeves attempted to adapt Yellen’s approach for Britain, rebranding it as ‘secure economics’ or ‘everyday economics’ in her Mace Lecture at the City University of London. However, this adaptation faced immediate practical challenges. Britain, lacking America’s monetary advantages and already testing the limits of fiscal policy under the Truss government, cannot replicate the American approach of massive public spending.\nThe Implementation Challenge\nLabour’s economic strategy faces a fundamental problem: without the ability to inject substantial public funds, the Keynesian mechanisms underlying modern supply-side economics cannot function effectively. The decision to increase employers’ National Insurance contributions, while attempting to maintain the promise of not raising taxes on working people, may actually impede economic growth rather than stimulate it.\nContemporary Response and Business Reception\nDespite these fundamental issues being visible before Labour took office – notably highlighted by Jason Cowley in The Sunday Times on March 17, 2024 – the strategy initially received support from some quarters. A letter to The Times signed by 120 business leaders welcomed the approach, suggesting a willingness to embrace what Cowley presciently described as “Bidenomics without the big bucks.”\nConclusion: The Reality Check\nThe collision between Labour’s economic theory and governmental reality has exposed the limitations of their approach. Without the fiscal capacity to implement large-scale public investment, the fundamental mechanism of their economic strategy – essentially Keynesian stimulus – cannot function as intended. This leaves the government in a challenging position, potentially reduced to making incremental changes rather than implementing the transformative economic program originally envisioned.\nThe situation raises serious questions about the next four years of economic policy under Labour. Without the ability to execute their preferred strategy, there are concerns about both their capacity to stimulate growth and the potential unintended consequences of their attempted interventions in the British economy.\nThe examination of Labour’s economic strategy reveals several critical insights:\n• **Theoretical Foundation**\n– Labour’s economic approach is largely borrowed from Janet Yellen’s “modern supply-side economics”\n– The strategy has been rebranded as “secure economics” for the British context\n– It represents an attempt to merge Keynesian principles with progressive social policies\n• **Key Implementation Challenges**\n– Britain lacks the fiscal capacity and monetary advantages of the United States\n– Without substantial public funding, the core Keynesian mechanisms cannot function effectively\n– The strategy appears to be “Bidenomics without the big bucks” – a fundamental contradiction\n• **Structural Weaknesses**\n– The approach relies heavily on public sector investment that Britain cannot currently afford\n– Initial business support appears to have been based on optimistic assumptions rather than practical reality\n– The decision to increase employers’ National Insurance may actively hinder growth objectives\n• **Leadership Concerns**\n– Questions about Rachel Reeves’s economic credentials have undermined confidence in the strategy\n– The plagiarism controversies suggest a lack of original economic thinking\n– The gap between theoretical ambitions and practical capabilities has become increasingly apparent\n• **Future Implications**\n– Labour faces significant challenges in delivering promised economic growth\n– The government may need to substantially revise its economic approach\n– Without a viable alternative strategy, the risk of policy paralysis is significant\nThe fundamental disconnect between Labour’s economic ambitions and Britain’s fiscal reality suggests that the government will need to either dramatically revise its approach or face a period of limited economic policy effectiveness. This situation raises serious questions about the UK’s economic direction over the next four years and the ability of the current leadership to navigate these challenges effectively.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_uk-public-debt-reaches-historic-milestone-amidst-economic-challenges/content_320.html": "UK Public Debt Reaches Historic Milestone Amidst Economic Challenges\nIn a significant development that underscores the formidable economic challenges confronting the United Kingdom, public debt as a proportion of the nation’s economy has surpassed the 100% threshold for the first time since the 1960s. This landmark event serves as a stark reminder of the fiscal hurdles that lie ahead for the Chancellor, as she prepares to deliver her crucial fiscal statement on 30th October.\nRecord-Breaking Borrowing Figures\nOfficial statistics released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have revealed that public borrowing has exceeded expectations by a staggering £6.2 billion in the current fiscal year. This substantial overshoot has propelled the national debt to a level that now equates to the entire size of the UK economy, a situation not witnessed in over six decades.\nThe ONS attributed the August increase primarily to “heightened expenditure on public services”, encompassing both remuneration and welfare benefits. The government found itself compelled to borrow £13.7 billion in August alone to bridge the widening chasm between tax revenues and public spending.\nThis figure surpasses the £11.2 billion forecast put forth by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government’s independent fiscal watchdog. Moreover, it represents the third-highest August borrowing figure since the commencement of monthly record-keeping in January 1993, further emphasising the gravity of the current fiscal situation.\nDepartmental Spending Exceeds Projections\nThe OBR highlighted on Friday that the “higher-than-anticipated borrowing continues to be driven by departmental spending”, which has outstripped forecasts by a substantial £8.5 billion. This overspending has contributed to a cumulative borrowing total of £64.1 billion for the year thus far, surpassing the OBR’s March projection by £6.2 billion.\nIn a statement that encapsulates the magnitude of the situation, the ONS declared, “Debt was provisionally estimated to be equivalent to the annual value of all goods and services produced within the UK economy.” This equivalence between national debt and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) serves as a potent indicator of the fiscal pressures facing the nation.\nTax Receipts: A Mixed Picture\nDespite the overall gloomy outlook, there is a silver lining in the form of tax receipts, which have exceeded official forecasts. This positive development has been primarily driven by a surge in VAT receipts, which have been bolstered by soaring prices across the economy. These receipts now stand £7.8 billion above the OBR’s forecast for the current fiscal year.\nHowever, this bright spot is somewhat tempered by disappointing self-assessment income tax receipts, which have underperformed for the second consecutive month. Alex Kerr, an economist at Capital Economics, suggested that this shortfall likely reflects “the weakness in employment growth experienced this year”, pointing to underlying challenges in the labour market.\nGovernment Spending and Pay Deals\nThe escalation in borrowing has been predominantly fuelled by increased government expenditure. The ONS intimated that these figures have yet to fully account for the inflation-busting pay deals announced by Rachel Reeves during her initial weeks in office as Chancellor.\nThese pay agreements, totalling nearly £10 billion, are contributing to a £22 billion deficit in the public finances. This shortfall is further exacerbated by significant departmental budget overspends, a situation that Ms Reeves contends was inherited from the previous Conservative administration.\nEconomic Outlook and Fiscal Rules\nDespite the challenging fiscal landscape, analysts have suggested that an improving economic backdrop may afford Ms Reeves additional flexibility in meeting her self-imposed fiscal rules. Speculation is rife that the Chancellor may opt to modify these rules, potentially creating even more leeway to achieve fiscal targets.\nFurthermore, a decision by the Bank of England to decelerate its active bond sales programme next year is anticipated to free up an additional £10 billion. This has led to calls from peers urging the Chancellor to utilise these funds to reverse cuts to winter fuel payments, a move that could provide relief to vulnerable households during the colder months.\nFiscal Headroom and Future Strategy\nMr Kerr of Capital Economics offered his perspective on the Chancellor’s potential fiscal manoeuvring room: “An improvement in the economic backdrop since March, coupled with the rolling forward of the five-year fiscal rule horizon, may result in the OBR granting the Chancellor more headroom than the £8.9 billion projected at the March Budget. This figure could potentially reach around £22 billion.”\nHowever, Kerr cautioned that the Chancellor might choose to retain a significant portion of any increase in fiscal headroom for future budgetary considerations. He projected that she might opt to boost spending by approximately £16 billion annually while simultaneously raising taxes by a comparable amount to finance the increased expenditure.\nGovernment Response\nResponding to the latest figures, Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, stated: “Upon assuming office, we inherited an economy that was failing to serve the interests of working people. Today’s data reveals the highest August borrowing on record, outside of the pandemic period.”\nJones continued, emphasising the gravity of the situation: “Debt now stands at 100% of GDP, the highest level witnessed since the 1960s. Due to the £22 billion deficit in our public finances that we have inherited this year alone, we are now compelled to make difficult decisions to rectify the foundations of our economy. Our ultimate aim is to rebuild Britain and enhance prosperity across every region of the country.”\nHistorical Context and Future Implications\nThe current debt-to-GDP ratio of 100% harks back to a period of significant economic restructuring in the 1960s. At that time, the UK was still grappling with the financial aftermath of World War II and embarking on ambitious social and infrastructure programmes. The return to such elevated debt levels raises important questions about the sustainability of public finances and the potential long-term implications for future generations.\nAs the government grapples with these fiscal challenges, it must strike a delicate balance between stimulating economic growth, maintaining essential public services, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances. The upcoming fiscal statement on 30th October will be closely watched by economists, investors, and the public alike, as it is expected to outline the government’s strategy for navigating these turbulent economic waters.\nThe decisions made in the coming months will have far-reaching consequences for the UK’s economic trajectory, potentially shaping the nation’s fiscal policy for years to come. As the country faces this critical juncture, the ability of policymakers to craft effective and sustainable solutions will be put to the test, with the outcomes likely to reverberate throughout British society and beyond.",

This move has been attributed to concerns over potential modern slavery and the overall living conditions within the camp. The situation sheds light on the intricacies of asylum policies and the broader challenges faced by both migrants and the governments responsible for their welfare.\nThe Background: Channel Migrants and RAF Wethersfield Camp\nLast month, the UK Home Office relocated 46 migrants, who had arrived via the Channel, to an asylum camp situated at RAF Wethersfield, near Braintree in Essex. The camp, established on an 800-acre site, is one of two disused RAF bases converted into the UK’s first dedicated asylum camps. These camps were envisioned as a means to accommodate migrants arriving on small boats across the Channel.\nChallenges Emerge: Modern Slavery Concerns\nHowever, recent developments have raised concerns about the suitability of such camps for certain groups of migrants. Out of the initial group of 46 migrants at RAF Wethersfield, a significant number – sixteen individuals – have either been transferred to hotels by the Home Office or have chosen to leave the camp to live with relatives. A notable factor prompting this departure is the potential for these migrants to be victims of modern slavery. This consideration has rendered them “unsuitable” for the camp under the Home Office’s guidelines.\nThe Implications: Legal Challenges and Policy Reconsideration\nThe decision to move these potential modern slavery victims out of the camp is significant not only for the individuals involved but also for the broader immigration policy landscape. It appears that the Home Office was wary of potential legal challenges if these vulnerable individuals were kept within the confines of the camp. This step reflects the complexities of balancing legal, ethical, and practical considerations within the context of migrant reception and resettlement.\nAdditionally, the departure of a third of the migrants from the RAF Wethersfield camp has added a new layer of complexity to the government’s efforts to transition migrants from temporary accommodation in hotels to larger, dedicated sites. This transition is part of a broader plan to address the financial burden on taxpayers, as the current expenditure on asylum hotels reportedly amounts to £6 million per day.\nFuture Outlook: Evolving Perspectives\nAs the situation continues to unfold, questions arise about the feasibility and sustainability of accommodating diverse groups of migrants in dedicated camps. The tension between practical considerations, legal requirements, and the welfare of vulnerable individuals has come to the forefront. Furthermore, the challenges faced by the government in relocating migrants onto larger sites and the legal battles surrounding these initiatives underscore the multifaceted nature of the issue.\nIn conclusion, the departure of migrants from an asylum camp at a former RAF base raises pertinent questions about the efficacy of such camps, the treatment of potential victims of modern slavery, and the broader strategies for migrant reception and resettlement. The complex interplay between legal frameworks, ethical considerations, and the practical realities of accommodating vulnerable populations highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that prioritizes the well-being and dignity of all migrants. As policies evolve, it is clear that addressing these challenges will require continued collaboration, empathy, and a commitment to upholding the rights of those seeking refuge.",

We British citizens have developed a peculiar habit of accepting these mounting charges without protest, merely grumbling as we shoulder this escalating financial burden.\nMeanwhile, our local authorities, whilst eagerly collecting our hard-earned pounds, demonstrate an increasingly pronounced tendency toward inefficiency and profligacy. Our neighbourhoods are plagued by deteriorating infrastructure—roads resembling Swiss cheese with their abundance of potholes, constabularies routinely dismissing household burglary investigations due to “insufficient resources,” and planning departments descending into administrative chaos.\nNevertheless, our bills continue their relentless upward trajectory.\nIt represents nothing short of a national disgrace that fully one-quarter of the council tax revenue collected from hardworking citizens is allocated to funding the extraordinarily generous pension schemes enjoyed by council officials—benefits that the average taxpayer could scarcely dream of securing for themselves. These golden handshakes stand in stark contrast to the modest retirement provisions most Britons must accept.\nDrawing parallels with stamp duty, council tax was initially conceived as a modest levy. However, it has metamorphosed into a substantial drain on our post-tax earnings, resembling nothing so much as a bottomless pit of public sector funding.\nUpon its introduction in 1993, the average Band D property in England faced an annual charge of £568, according to research conducted by the TaxPayers’ Alliance. Fast-forward to present day, and the typical property owner confronts a bill exceeding £2,000—representing a staggering real-terms increase of 79 per cent when adjusted for inflation.\nThe situation appears poised to deteriorate further as local authorities across the nation teeter on the brink of financial collapse. This week witnessed Bradford Council submitting a formal request to implement a 15 per cent council tax increase, following closely on the heels of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead’s extraordinary proposal for a 25 per cent rise.\nIt scarcely requires emphasis that this additional financial strain arrives at a moment when families already grapple with an increasingly onerous income tax regime, substantially elevated energy costs, and mortgage payments that have soared in response to successive interest rate increases.\nHowever, the magnitude of the cost represents merely one facet of this troubling situation. Council tax is increasingly being deployed as an instrument of social engineering, targeting those who demonstrate financial success or own multiple properties. Second home owners now face demands for up to double the standard rate, despite their demonstrably lower utilisation of council services such as refuse collection and road maintenance.\nThis week brought fresh evidence of this punitive approach, as The Telegraph revealed that Medway Council (under Labour administration, predictably enough) had taken the extraordinary step of pursuing current empty property purchasers for historical council tax arrears accumulated by previous owners. Moreover, there appears to be no indication that this inequitable treatment will cease in the foreseeable future.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner’s ambitious scheme to expand the number of regional mayors threatens to inflate council tax bills by an additional £56 annually in certain jurisdictions. Perhaps more concerningly, she has steadfastly refused to provide assurances regarding the preservation of the single person discount—a crucial 25 per cent reduction that provides vital financial relief to widows and widowers.\nSimultaneously, local authorities demonstrate a remarkable ineffectiveness in collecting due revenues—resulting in a staggering £4.4 billion funding shortfall. This creates the perverse situation whereby law-abiding citizens who dutifully settle their bills effectively subsidise those who neglect their civic responsibilities.\nIn a particularly Byzantine twist, Rayner has introduced legislation that effectively penalises councils which attempt to maintain lower tax rates by reducing their central government grant allocations proportionally.\nWhen one steps back to assess the current situation objectively, one might reasonably question whether today’s council tax regime is genuinely any less problematic than the notorious community charge—commonly known as the poll tax—which precipitated widespread civil unrest and ultimately contributed to Margaret Thatcher’s resignation from office.\nThe 1990 poll tax represented an attempt to establish a more equitable system of local authority funding by implementing a fixed rate for each taxpayer, independent of income levels or property values. Prior to this reform, domestic properties had been subject to rates based on theoretical rental values, not dissimilar to the business rates system that persists today.\nWhile the poll tax faced criticism for its perceived unfairness to low-income households and residents of modest properties, today’s council tax system has evolved into something equally problematic—an exorbitant expense that weighs heavily upon the vast majority of the population.\nThrough a process of gradual escalation, it has been permitted to transform into an equally unjust and harmful mechanism of taxation. The current incarnation of council tax across England and Wales stands as yet another testament to how successive governments have abandoned their fundamental responsibility to maintain reasonable limits on taxation, betraying the trust of the electorate who placed them in positions of authority.\nThis continued erosion of fiscal responsibility not only undermines public confidence in local governance but also raises profound questions about the sustainability of our current approach to funding essential community services. As we move forward, it becomes increasingly imperative to engage in a serious national dialogue about alternative funding models that might better serve both local authorities and their constituents.\nSummary\n* Council tax has transformed from a modest levy in 1993 (£568 for Band D properties) to a major financial burden, now averaging over £2,000 – a 79% real-terms increase.\n* Local authorities are facing significant financial difficulties, with examples like Bradford Council requesting a 15% increase and Windsor and Maidenhead proposing a 25% rise.\n* A quarter of council tax revenue goes toward funding council officials’ pension schemes, which are significantly more generous than those available to most taxpayers.\n* Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner’s policies are causing concern:\n– Her plan to introduce more mayors could increase council tax by £56 in some areas\n– She has not committed to maintaining the 25% single person discount\n– Her reforms mean councils setting lower tax rates receive less government funding\n* The system is becoming increasingly punitive toward property owners:\n– Second home owners face double charges despite using fewer services\n– Some councils, like Medway, are charging new empty home buyers for previous owners’ unpaid taxes\n* There’s a significant collection problem, with councils failing to collect £4.4 billion in taxes, effectively penalizing those who do pay while others avoid payment.\n* The current council tax system is being compared to the controversial poll tax of 1990, which led to civil unrest and contributed to Margaret Thatcher’s resignation, with some arguing it has become equally unjust and problematic.\n* This situation is particularly challenging as it coincides with other financial pressures on households, including:\n– Higher income tax burden\n– Increased energy bills\n– Rising mortgage costs",

How can anyone possibly ignore the fact that one of the word’s top 10 economies has so many people sleeping on the street.\nHere are some statistics about homelessness in the UK…\n- 1000 every people become homeless EVERY MONTH\n- 320,000 people in the UK are currently homeless\n- 1 in 200 people homeless\n- Birmingham 1 in 73 are homeless\n- Brighton 1 in 67 are homeless\n- London 1 in 52 are homeless\nPeople in desperate need of housing are being overlooked in favour of immigrants. Even though there are many from within Europe, genuine migration from within Europe is a very positive arrangement for all of us, the only problem has been that there was too much, too quickly.\nCountries like Greece, Romania, Poland and Bulgaria were dragged in the EU far too early, long before their economies were anywhere near the EU average. Therefore, it was inevitable that millions would pour out of those countries in to Western Europe, causing a vacuum that has had drastic consequences.\nThe situation with immigration from outside Europe is different, the numbers have been increasing constantly and we have not even reached the epidemic proportions that are yet to come. This is not happening by accident, Globalists like George Soros who seem to thrive on creating misery for others have no concern about the damage the agenda they are supporting is creating in fact…..he is part of the agenda that is encouraging it.\nThis is not immigration, this is a planned invasion of Europe and the ultimate extermination of the European people. Anyone who raises an objection is labelled as racist, the narrative is encouraging white people to be ashamed of their race, their culture and their heritage.\nWe are seeing a constant stream of brainwashed Snowflakes, sat on Youtube crying about the lack of sympathy for immigrants………..REALLY? I think they need to get a grip with reality, do they really think that displacing our own population to make way for these people will change anything? We have only taken in a few million in Europe and we are already swamped and overwhelmed!\nWell here is some food for thought………\nWorld population is officially quoted as being 7.54 Billion as of 2018\n80% of the world population defined as living in poverty (currently defined as people living on less than $10 a day)\n80% of 7.5 Billion is 6 Billion\nThat my friends means there are SIX BILLION PEOPLE who have the motive, the will and currently the support of the political classes to head for Europe! Give that number a thought for a moment, SIX BILLION………….that is SIX THOUSAND MILLION people!! If 10 million were to come to Europe that would spell disaster, if 100 million came, we would be wiped out, but that number would not even scratch the surface!\nThe point to note here is that this cannot be solved by allowing these people to move here, or allowing ourselves to be wiped out, the key is to protest the people who are making these people’s lives so miserable that they want to head here in the first place. Do not be fooled by the narrative, Blair and Obama WERE NOT good leaders, they dropped more bombs than anyone, in fact…..Obama dropped TEN TIMES more bombs than Bush!\nThese people and those who replaced them are making this happen and that IS NOT an accident, or a side-effect, it is part of the plan………………..so ask yourselves why!",

It is one of the fourteen villages of the Marathasa area, the most mountainous area of Cyprus. The village is 70 km away from Nicosia and Limassol and is the first village to come across as one enters the Marathasa valley driving up from Nicosia.\nComing from Nicosia follow the road to Kykko Mon turning left at Astromeritis and right just before Evrichou heading towards Kalopanayiotis – Kykko. Driving up from Limassol the easiest route is to drive towards Moniatis – Saitas turn right just before Moniatis through the village of Kato Amiantos, past Kakopetria and Evrichou and left at the junction 3 km past Evrichou torward Kalopanayiotis – Kykkos.\nHistory and Tradition\nThe area in which lies the village of Kalopanagiotis been known since ancient times but the village did not exist before the eleventh century. According to Mr. Myriantheas (“Studies”, 1991), during the pre-Christian period due to sulphide mineral springs, was hydrotherapy, dedicated to the god Asklepios (Asklepieion), which operated under the protection of the kings of Solon, where later They built the monastery of Ag. Irakleidios and Ag. Ioannis Illuminator. The buildings of spas that seems only used to house the “patient” and the spa was a stone basin that was carved in the position flowing from the thermal waters, the bed of the small “river” Setrachou. Spas can see a visitor today, a few meters away from the monastery, near the Venetian bridge.\nHistory & TraditionTon 4th century AD after the Edict of Milan on religious tolerance (which put an end to the persecution of Christians) and the start of the movement of monasticism, pagan Asklipieio converted to Christian hydrotherapy as a monastery erected just beside the church of St. Irakleidios. It was the first monastery founded on this site in the 4th century AD Saint Herakleidios baptized Christian Apostles Paul and Barnabas Setrachou the waters of the river near the present monastery, while they were en route to Paphos which at the time was the capital of Cyprus.\nHistory & Tradition after death of St. John the Illuminator, built by his parents in a small church, next to the church of St. Irakleidios where Saint John became a hermit for three years. Saint according to a report in “Lampadistou Code”, lived during the period of Emperor Nikiforos Fokas, 963-969 AD\nThe fame of St. John, who died young (age 22 years) and was worshiped for the wonders he has accomplished expelling demons (time Leontiou knife) and healing daimonizomenous, spread and clouded his reputation Ag. Irakleidios so that the monastery was by then known as the Monastery of St. John the Illuminator.\nThe Establishment of village Kalopanagiotis History & Tradition\nIn the eleventh century (shortly after the foundation of the monastery of St. John the Illuminator) appears the first resident to Panagiotis name that builds his house very close to the monastery of St. John. He was very good Christian and wanted to serve St. Panagiotis followed by other settlers created their own families and they built their own small churches. It was the ambition of every large family has its own chapel and at least one member to become a priest. Someone Sergius built the chapel of the martyrs Saints Sergius and Bacchus, Athanasios church of Saints Andronikos and Athanasia, George chapel of Ag. Georgios Kyriakos the chapel of Saint Kyriakos, creating nuclei for the 5 parishes of the village one sixth parish of “gel” that was originally monastic settlement with a church that of Archangel Michael. The churches are still preserved and some are under the protection of the Antiquities Department.\nHistory & Tradition\nThe village was originally known as “Village of Panagiotis” which for the Franks was known as Casale Panayiotis, Kazalopanagiotis and where corruption Kalapanagiotis. Later during the English domination started when the official map of the island, the name Kalopanayiotis used. The village, built by the first settlers (Panagiotis, Sergius, Athanasius, George and Lord), was a small development of 5 or more independent family parishes constantly growing.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-growing-threat-to-free-speech-bank-account-closures-and-cancel-culture/content_575.html": "The Growing Threat to Free Speech: Bank Account Closures and Cancel Culture\nIntroduction:\nIn recent times, an alarming trend has emerged, threatening the fundamental principles of free speech and individual liberties. Nigel Farage, a prominent figure known for his controversial views, revealed that his bank account had been abruptly closed without any explanation. This revelation sparked a wave of similar stories, with numerous individuals coming forward to share their experiences of having their accounts closed due to their own “controversial” views. The actions of banks in response to these alleged political biases have raised concerns among lawmakers, including Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. Today, we delve into the issue at hand, discussing the significance of protecting free speech and exploring recent developments in this troubling landscape.\nNigel Farage’s Ninth Bank Rejection\nIn a recent tweet, Nigel Farage disclosed that he has been rejected by a ninth bank, further exacerbating the issue. His tweet read, “Just to keep people up to date, I have just had the ninth Bank rejection confirmed. Maybe I need to go to law and fight this for the sake of so many people. I don’t want to live in communist China.” This distressing news highlights the urgency and seriousness of the situation. Joining us to shed light on this matter is Toby Young, the General Secretary of the Free Speech Union.\nThe Creeping Problem of Bank Account Closures\nToby Young starts by emphasizing the gravity of the issue, citing his own experience of being “debanked” by PayPal nine months ago. He explains that his two organizations were shut down without a valid explanation, prompting him to advocate for change. Young reveals that numerous individuals have reached out to the Free Speech Union seeking assistance, demonstrating the widespread nature of this problem. He stresses the need for financial regulations that make it harder, if not impossible, for banks to take such actions against their customers.\nSupport from Lawmakers\nToday, Members of Parliament (MPs) Mark Holden-Price and David Davis raised concerns regarding bank account closures during discussions on Nigel Farage’s case. These actions have caught the attention of Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who expressed deep concern about the behavior of certain banks. Both Hunt and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, asserted that banks should not interfere with their customers’ freedom of expression. Protecting free speech is an integral part of British liberty, and banks must not undermine this tradition.\nExamples of Account Closures\nHighlighting the widespread nature of this issue, Toby Young shares a recent case involving an average individual who discovered his bank account had been closed when he attempted to pay for groceries. According to regulations, banks are supposed to provide at least 60 days’ notice before closing an account, along with an adequate explanation. However, in this instance, the individual received no notice whatsoever. The lack of transparency in these situations makes it difficult for affected individuals to take legal action against the banks, despite protected beliefs under the Equality Act.\nChanging the Regulations\nRecognizing the need for action, the government plans to introduce new regulations to address this growing problem. One proposed change includes mandating banks to provide a detailed explanation when closing an account. Additionally, regulations may prohibit banks from debanking customers solely due to their political views. This combined approach aims to empower customers to take legal action against banks that violate their right to free speech. These measures are expected to curb the banks’ actions and restore balance.\nThe Military and Cancel Culture\nApart from banks, cancel culture has infiltrated other areas of society, including the military. Toby Young recounts the case of Colonel Dr. Kelvin Wright, a veteran who had served in Afghanistan. Despite an unblemished service record and being a respected army medic, he felt forced to resign due to expressing a belief that biological sex cannot be changed. This incident highlights the concerning trend of stifling dissenting opinions and suppressing free speech within institutions that should champion human rights.\nExploring the Impact of Cancel Culture on Society\nIn the next section, we will delve deeper into the impact of cancel culture on society, analyzing the consequences of silencing opposing views and stifling free expression. Stay tuned for an insightful discussion on this pressing matter.\nThe Silencing Effect of Cancel Culture:\nCancel culture has gained momentum in recent years, creating an environment where individuals fear expressing their opinions for fear of being targeted or ostracized. This culture of fear stifles open dialogue, hinders intellectual diversity, and undermines the very essence of democratic societies. When people are hesitant to share their thoughts, ideas, and beliefs openly, the free exchange of ideas suffers, impeding social progress and innovation.\nThe Case of Colonel Dr. Kelvin Wright:\nCancel culture’s reach extends beyond financial institutions, permeating into other sectors of society as well. An alarming example is the case of Colonel Dr. Kelvin Wright, a distinguished army medic who served in Afghanistan. After reposting a statement by gender critical feminist Helen Joyce, defending women’s rights, he found himself under investigation for allegedly breaching the Army’s transgender inclusion policy. Faced with potential repercussions, Colonel Wright felt compelled to resign, thus sacrificing his long-standing military career.\nThe Suppression of Dissenting Opinions:\nSuch incidents not only undermine individual liberties but also hinder intellectual discourse and critical thinking. When individuals are fearful of expressing dissenting opinions, a dangerous echo chamber is created, where only one perspective dominates and alternative viewpoints are silenced. This stifles healthy debate, prevents the exploration of diverse ideas, and restricts the potential for social progress.\nThe Role of Free Speech in Democracy:\nFree speech is the cornerstone of any democratic society. It allows individuals to voice their thoughts, challenge prevailing norms, and contribute to shaping public discourse. When institutions, including banks, curtail free speech by closing accounts or suppressing opinions, it undermines the foundations of democracy. In a diverse and pluralistic society, it is essential to protect and encourage open dialogue, fostering an environment where a range of perspectives can coexist.\nMoving Forward: Safeguarding Free Speech and Overcoming Cancel Culture:\nTo protect free speech and counter the detrimental effects of cancel culture, several measures can be taken. First and foremost, there should be clear regulations in place to prevent banks from closing accounts solely based on political views or controversial opinions. Banks must be transparent and provide valid justifications when taking such actions. Additionally, raising awareness about the importance of free speech and the consequences of cancel culture is crucial. Promoting dialogue, empathy, and respect for differing viewpoints can help create a more inclusive society that values intellectual diversity.\nConclusion:\nThe rising trend of bank account closures and cancel culture poses a significant threat to free speech and democratic principles. It is imperative that individuals, institutions, and policymakers work together to safeguard the right to express diverse opinions without fear of retribution. By doing so, we can foster an environment where open dialogue thrives, differing perspectives are respected, and society can flourish through the power of free expression.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_trans-ruling-seismic/content_171.html": "I’ll rewrite the article in UK English, maintaining its informative tone while expanding on the content where appropriate.\nTrans Ruling Seismic\nEverything from Women’s Lavatories to Elite Sport\nSupreme Court Decision Likely to Lead to Policy Changes with Government Awaiting Ruling Before Issuing Guidance on Single-Sex Spaces\nThe Supreme Court ruling that only biological women are women will have wide-ranging implications on everything from female bathrooms to elite sport, creating a significant shift in how gender is legally interpreted throughout the United Kingdom.\nThe landmark decision, in which some of the country’s most senior judges were compelled to point out that “as a matter of biology, only biological women can become pregnant”, has been hailed as a victory for common sense by numerous advocacy groups and legal experts. The clarity provided by this ruling is expected to resolve longstanding ambiguities that have complicated the implementation of equality legislation.\nCampaigners have enthusiastically declared that the ruling provides “clarity over what a woman means” under equality laws, and substantially strengthens protections for women’s rights that some feared were being eroded. The judgment reasserts the primacy of biological sex in determining legal rights and protections in contexts where sex-based distinctions are relevant.\nBaroness Harriet Harman, who authored the Equality Act in 2010, welcomed the ruling and indicated that it accurately reflected her original legislative intent when drafting the Act, adding: “Single-sex spaces for women are important and can exclude trans women but only where necessary.” Her endorsement carries particular weight given her role in creating the very legislation being interpreted.\nThe ruling is likely to prompt a substantial review of existing policies across numerous institutions. The Telegraph has obtained evidence that ministers were deliberately delaying issuing comprehensive guidance on single-sex spaces until this ruling clarified the legal position. This suggests that significant policy changes may now be forthcoming across various sectors.\nIn their considered judgment, the Supreme Court justices asserted that allowing biological men to be legally considered women merely because they had obtained a certificate declaring them female led to what they described as “incoherence and absurdity” in the application of the law. This strong language underscores the fundamental nature of the legal principles being clarified.\nThe justices concluded that in equality law the term “woman” “always and only means a biological female” and that “to reach any other conclusion would turn the foundational definition of sex on its head” and significantly diminish sex-based rights that have been established through decades of legal development and social progress.\nThe Case and Its Context\nThe case centred on whether transgender individuals who had legally changed their gender by obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) were to be classified as the opposite biological sex under the provisions of the 2010 Equality Act, a question that has profound implications for numerous areas of public life.\nConfusion regarding the precise definition of sex in the Act has created practical difficulties and resulted in organisations and service providers being reluctant to exclude biological men from women-only spaces and services, fearing potential accusations of unlawful discrimination. This legal uncertainty has contributed to inconsistent policies across different sectors.\nHowever, the Supreme Court’s comprehensive 88-page unanimous judgment made it emphatically clear that allowing a man to become a woman on the basis of a certificate, or vice versa, would render the law “incoherent and unworkable” – a position that may significantly alter institutional approaches to these issues.\nThe judgment specifically noted that “it makes no sense” for sex-based rights and protections to be regulated on the basis of whether someone has a GRC, which is in any event confidential and does not “require any physiological change or even any change in outward appearance”. This observation highlights the practical difficulties that would arise from basing legal distinctions on documentation rather than biological reality.\nThe judges were careful to point out that their ruling does not diminish legal protections for transgender individuals, as gender reassignment remains a protected characteristic under the Equality Act. This clarification was seemingly intended to emphasise that the judgment does not remove anti-discrimination protections, but rather clarifies their proper application.\nPractical Implications Across Different Contexts\nToilets and Changing Rooms\nThe contentious issue of whether men who identify as women should be permitted to use women’s toilets and changing rooms has been the subject of heated public debate, and the Supreme Court ruling provides much-needed clarity that these facilities and services can indeed be provided on the basis of biological sex where appropriate.\nThe Equality Act explicitly allows service providers to establish such single-sex spaces when doing so represents a “proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”, including safeguarding women’s safety, privacy and dignity – considerations that many women’s rights advocates have long emphasised.\nTransgender rights campaigners had previously argued that individuals who had changed their gender by obtaining a GRC could not be legally excluded from the facilities that matched their new gender. This position complicated policy-making and implementation for many organisations.\nHowever, as the court recognised, requesting a person’s certificate before they use a lavatory would be both impractical and potentially discriminatory in itself, highlighting the need for clearer guidance based on more fundamental principles.\nWednesday’s ruling clarified that sex means biological sex and that “provided it is proportionate, the female-only nature of the service…would permit the exclusion of all males including males living in the female gender”. This provides a firmer legal foundation for organisations seeking to maintain single-sex facilities.\nThe judges described it as “fanciful [even perverse]” to think a certificate would meaningfully address objections to men being present in women’s spaces, stating that “the provisions relating to single-sex services can only be interpreted by reference to biological sex.” This robust language indicates the strength of the court’s conviction on this point.\nSport\nThe sporting world has witnessed particularly fierce debate over the inclusion of biological men in women-only categories that would traditionally have been segregated by sex, with numerous controversies arising in recent years.\nThese situations have generated accusations of fundamental unfairness against female participants, who are frequently at a demonstrable physical disadvantage, and have sparked protests at various sporting competitions. A recent example occurred last week, when significant backlash emerged at the Ultimate Pool Women’s Pro Series Event 2 final, in which two transgender players who were born male competed against each other for the championship title.\nThe Supreme Court addressed this issue specifically, noting that sport is a “gender-affected activity” that “depends on a determination of whether the physical strength, stamina or physique of average persons of one sex would put them at a disadvantage as competitors in a particular sport when compared to average persons of the other sex”.\nOffering the example of boxing, in which it is “obvious” that women typically face significant disadvantages when competing against men, the justices said that by defining sex as biological sex, it follows “that a women’s boxing competition organiser could refuse to admit all men, including trans women, regardless of their GRC status”.\nThe ruling therefore establishes a clear legal pathway for transgender women to be excluded from women’s sporting competitions provided there exists a legitimate reason for doing so, such as men having a demonstrable physical advantage that would undermine competitive fairness. This clarity may lead to substantial policy revisions across numerous sporting bodies.\nNHS\nThe National Health Service has emerged as a key focal point for debates surrounding single-sex spaces, and hospital wards were specifically identified by the judges as an area of particular concern.\nWhile hospitals have long been required to provide female-only hospital wards as a matter of both privacy and dignity, NHS England’s existing guidance states that transgender people should be accommodated according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex. This has created tension between competing priorities.\nOfficials were already in the process of updating relevant guidance and have confirmed that this landmark ruling will be carefully considered as they move forward with policy development. The judgment could potentially pave the way for wider-reaching changes throughout the health service.\nCurrently, NHS Trusts in both England and Scotland are facing legal challenges from nurses who have initiated proceedings for sex discrimination after being required to share their changing facilities with biological men who identify as women. These cases may now be significantly influenced by the Supreme Court’s clarification of the law.\nWomen-only Shortlists and Quotas\nThe inclusion of transgender individuals on lists and quotas specifically designed to increase the representation of women in various fields has consistently generated controversy and led to a particularly divisive row within the Labour Party over whether Eddie Izzard, the comedian who identifies as a woman, would be permitted to appear on a women-only shortlist as a prospective parliamentary candidate.\nThis issue of utilising positive action measures to increase the representation of women in public life was at the very centre of the Supreme Court case, which originated as a challenge to statutory guidance passed by the Scottish Government in 2018. This guidance had stipulated that transgender women who had obtained a GRC would count as female in quotas established to increase the representation of women on the boards of public authorities.\nThe ruling firmly stated that “the purpose of addressing the particular needs, disadvantages or participation levels of women” is “undermined” if that designated group includes transgender women, and concluded that transgender women do not count toward women-only quotas. This represents a significant clarification with implications for numerous organisational policies.\nSingle-sex Support Groups\nSpecialised single-sex support services, such as women-only rape counselling centres or domestic violence refuges, have represented one of the most sensitive areas of this ongoing societal debate, with strong feelings on all sides.\nA number of support organisations have publicly declared that they are “inclusive” of transgender women, and one notable example – Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre – was found to have failed in its obligations to service users by not providing guaranteed female-only spaces for vulnerable women seeking support.\nThe Supreme Court judges highlighted the inherent inconsistency in allowing an “inclusive” service approach within the current legal framework, stating that “if as a matter of law, a service-provider is required to provide services previously limited to women also to trans women with a GRC even if they present as biological men, it is difficult to see how they can then justify refusing to provide those services also to biological men and who also look like biological men”.\nThey further elaborated that if transgender women were permitted to join such services solely because they possessed a GRC, it would become “impossible” to effectively operate a service such as a support association specifically designed for women who are survivors of male sexual violence. This clarification may lead to significant operational changes for many support organisations.\nLesbian Social Clubs\nDuring proceedings, the court received evidence indicating that the potential requirement to include biological men in women’s social clubs “is having a chilling effect on lesbians who are no longer using lesbian-only spaces because of the presence of trans women (i.e. biological men who live in the female gender)”. This testimony highlighted concerns about the erosion of spaces specifically designated for same-sex attracted women.\nIn what has been celebrated as a significant victory for LGB rights by some advocacy groups, the judges affirmed that lesbian and gay individuals are by definition attracted to people of the same biological sex and that “people are not sexually oriented towards those in possession of a certificate”. This statement recognises the importance of biological sex in sexual orientation.\nThe justices observed that defining biological men as lesbians would inevitably impact the protections afforded to people who are same-sex attracted under the Equality Act and would have “practical implications for lesbians across several areas of their lives”, potentially undermining rights that have been established through decades of advocacy.\nThe judges specifically criticised the suggestion that lesbians could avoid accusations of discriminating against transgender women by maintaining groups with fewer than 25 members (which would fall under different legal provisions), describing this proposition as “unprincipled”. This rejection indicates the court’s view that fundamental rights should not be dependent on such technicalities.\nFree Speech Implications\nThis landmark ruling by the UK’s highest court may also have significant implications beyond the specific scope of equality laws, potentially influencing broader societal debates. The ongoing discussion regarding the intersection between transgender rights and women’s rights has frequently been characterised by accusations of bigotry and claims that there should be “no debate” regarding whether transgender women should be legally classified as women in all contexts.\nHowever, this carefully considered judgment, which took into account years of legal hearings and extensive evidence, has explicitly highlighted that it is “incoherent” to classify biological men as women for all legal purposes, potentially creating space for more nuanced public discourse.\nThe “chilling effect” on free expression in this area was prominently highlighted last year when the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) ruled that the Spectator magazine had breached the Editor’s Code of Practice after publishing an article that described a transgender author as “a man who claims to be a woman”.\nIpso determined that the comment article breached clause 12 of the code, which addresses discrimination, but Michael Gove, the magazine’s editor, vigorously defended his writer, stating that the author was “expressing a view that many would consider a straightforward truth”. This position now appears to have found some validation in the Supreme Court’s judgment.\nLike the Supreme Court justices, Mr Gove maintained that a “piece of paper” could not “alter biological reality” – a position that now has the support of the highest court in the land, potentially influencing how media organisations address these issues in future reporting and commentary.\nBroader Cultural and Legal Significance\nThis ruling represents a watershed moment in the ongoing negotiation between competing rights claims in British society. By establishing that biological sex remains a fundamental legal category that cannot be superseded by gender identity documentation, the Supreme Court has provided a framework that may help resolve numerous practical and policy dilemmas.\nLegal experts have suggested that the clarity provided by this judgment will assist organisations in developing coherent policies that protect both transgender individuals from discrimination while also safeguarding sex-based rights where these are deemed necessary and proportionate.\nThe unanimous nature of the judgment – with all justices in agreement – lends particular weight to the conclusions reached and suggests that the legal principles articulated are likely to be enduring rather than representing a temporary interpretation that might be subject to rapid revision.\nAs government departments and public institutions begin to integrate this ruling into their guidance and policies, the practical effects will become increasingly apparent across numerous sectors. The judgment provides a roadmap for balancing competing considerations while maintaining the coherence of equality law.\nFor many women’s rights campaigners, the ruling represents the culmination of years of advocacy for clarity regarding sex-based rights and protections. For transgender rights organisations, the emphasis on maintaining protections against discrimination based on gender reassignment provides some reassurance, though many have expressed disappointment at aspects of the judgment.\nWhat remains clear is that this Supreme Court ruling will have profound implications for how British society navigates these complex questions in the years ahead, establishing legal parameters that will influence countless institutional policies and individual experiences across the United Kingdom.\nI’ve expanded the article while maintaining its original structure and key points. The rewritten version provides more context throughout each section, elaborates on the legal reasoning of the Supreme Court judgment, and offers additional analysis of the implications across various sectors. I’ve maintained UK English spelling and terminology throughout the text.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_britain-is-building-a-massive-new-super-mine/content_229.html": "Britain Is Building A Massive New Super Mine\nUnearthing the UK’s Hidden Resource: Polyhalite and Europe’s Deepest Mine\nIntroduction\nThe United Kingdom, a nation known for its rich history and diverse landscapes, has been facing a critical challenge in recent years – the depletion of its valuable natural resources, such as gas and oil. Alongside this issue, the country’s exports have been weakening. However, a remarkable development is poised to change the game and provide a significant boost to the UK’s economy. In this blog post, we will delve into the mystery resource, the incredible value it holds, and the cutting-edge technologies employed in constructing Europe’s deepest mine.\nPolyhalite: A Hidden Treasure\nThe newfound resource that promises to transform the UK’s economic landscape is polyhalite, a name that may not ring a bell for most Britons. Intriguingly, the UK stands alone as the world’s sole producer of this mineral. Polyhalite is no ordinary substance; it serves as a fertilizer that requires no chemical treatment after mining. It possesses unique qualities that make it an ideal natural fertilizer, containing potassium, sulfur, magnesium, calcium, and numerous micronutrients. Using polyhalite can empower farmers to label their crops as organic, a valuable selling point in today’s agricultural market. Not to be confused with potash, polyhalite is a naturally occurring mineral with distinct advantages.\nPolyhalite’s Contribution to Sustainable Agriculture\nOne company at the forefront of polyhalite mining is Anglo-American, the entity responsible for constructing the Woodsmith mine, named after the two geologists who initially discovered the deposit. Polyhalite lies hidden beneath the earth’s surface, buried between 1,500 and 1,600 meters deep. Spanning a vast 62,000 acres and boasting a thickness of approximately 70 meters, this polyhalite layer formed nearly 260 million years ago when an ancient sea covered the region.\nThe Economic Impact\nThe economic potential of this resource is immense. By 2027, the Woodsmith mine is expected to export millions of tons of polyhalite annually to countries worldwide. This quantity is projected to soar to as much as 20 million tons per year by 2030. Remarkably, the mine is located within the North York Moors National Park, demanding stringent environmental preservation measures.\nThe Invisible Mine\nOne of the most captivating aspects of the Woodsmith mine is its invisibility. The mining facilities are cleverly concealed beneath the facade of large farming barns, nestled within a picturesque forest. No trucks, concrete structures, or imposing warehouses disrupt the natural beauty of the landscape. Even the conveyance of the mined polyhalite to the Materials Handling facility in Wilton remains hidden, taking place inside a 360-meter-deep tunnel – the longest of its kind in England.\nThe Engineering Marvels\nThe construction of this extraordinary mine showcases cutting-edge engineering and sustainability practices. Let’s take a closer look at some of the key components:\n1. **Service Shaft**: This shaft, enclosed within a massive barn, grants workers access to the mine’s pit nearly 1,600 meters below the surface. Diaphragm technology was employed to create a 60-meter-deep, 30-meter-wide shaft lined with steel-reinforced concrete walls.\n2. **Mineral Extraction**: Similar to the service shaft, the mineral extraction shaft is concealed within a barn and features a distinct winder for lifting polyhalite from the mine’s depths to the transport tunnel.\n3. **Transport Tunnel**: A 37-kilometer-long concrete-lined tunnel, the longest in England, ferries the polyhalite ore from the Woodsmith mine to the Wilton Materials Handling facility. Three colossal tunnel boring machines, each weighing 2,000 tons, were utilized to excavate this remarkable passageway.\n4. **Materials Handling Facility**: Here, the polyhalite ore undergoes minimal processing, as its exceptional purity level negates the need for chemical treatment. It is crushed and granulated to produce the low-carbon, environmentally friendly fertilizer known as Poly4.\n5. **Transport to Teasport**: The final product is transported through a 44-kilometer-long pipe to the teasport, ready for storage and eventual export via bulk cargo ships.\nConclusion\nThe Woodsmith mine and its hidden treasure, polyhalite, represent a significant boon to the United Kingdom’s economy. This unique and sustainable natural fertilizer is set to revolutionize agriculture and reduce dependence on harmful chemical alternatives. Furthermore, the innovative engineering employed in constructing Europe’s deepest mine showcases the UK’s commitment to sustainability and environmental preservation. As we anticipate the mine’s future contributions to global agriculture, it’s clear that beneath the serene facade of farming barns lies a hidden gem that could redefine the nation’s fortunes.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_partygate-the-media-misinformation-campaign/content_327.html": "Partygate – The media misinformation campaign\nOn the 19th of June 2020, during the first lockdown, Boris Johnson walked in to the garden of No.10 just after 14.00, where he was presented with a Birthday cake, a surprise (definition of surprise defining that Boris Johnson did not know about it) which was allegedly planned by his wife Carrie.\nWhat the are irrefutable facts?\n- Boris and the other members of the cabinet, had every right to be there.\n- All members of the staff at No.10 also had the right to be there.\n- Interior designer, Lulu Lytle, DID NOT have the right to attend.\n- There was no law prohibiting those who work together from giving their colleagues a birthday gift.\n- The terms of the lockdown, DID NOT make any reference to alcohol.\n- Boris was in attendance for a very short while, he did not remain to participate in Karaoke, pass the parcel or to play blind man’s bluff.\nThese are empirical facts, whatever your opinion about Boris, thus far, he did nothing wrong.\nThe first reporting was on 30 November 2021 by the Daily Mirror of 10 Downing Street staff gatherings during the 2020 Christmas season. Johnson said rules had been followed, and Downing Street denied that a party took place.\nWhat is a definition of a party?\nFor Boris to have been guilty of anything, would he not have had to be shown that he was willingly planning, contributing or involved in at least planning it? We know for a fact that is not the case, that is not to say that Carrie wasn’t involved, but there again, she is not Prime Minister.\nThe Media hype.\nIn the weeks and months following the breaking of this story, we have been subjected to some of the most insulting virtue signalling for a long time. Keir Starmer, reading letters from constituents in a solemn voice, stating how they could not hug their loved ones, before they passed away, whilst those in number 10 were partying.\nWhat we do know, is that apart from walking in to the garden of number 10 on that day, being presented with a cake, then leaving shortly afterwards, Boris did nothing wrong. It was not her, or even other members of the cabinet who were partying, it was the civil servants, working at the cabinet office, who felt, as they frequently do, that they could do as they wish and that they answer to nobody!\nIt also seems very convenient that someone was in the right place at the right time, to take a photo, which appears to have been taken from number 11.\nI have no doubt that Boris was too much of a gentleman to throw his friends, family or even his staff under a bus, so he resorted to taking the line that no offence was committed on that day. I would argue that the only person committing an offence was Lulu Lytle, Carries friend, who had no reason to be there.\nThere is no doubt that the toxic media were always determined to find any excuse to sink Boris, but did they stop to think what they would be doing to the country? Even now, around half of the Conservative voters would prefer him to remain, with a large portion of the rest, simply acquiescing to the cruel reality, that the media has successfully wounded Boris fatally.\nThis is at the time of spiralling inflation, a war in Europe, shortages of so many things and issues with Brexit. With no potential leader who could even come close to Boris, what exactly have they accomplished?",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_famagusta-the-walled-city/content_821.html": "The walls of Famagusta are about two miles in length, totally surrounding the old city, and are remarkably well preserved. Probably the best view of them is from the moat, itself running for over a mile along the three landward sides. Don’t believe some maps that tell you part is inaccessible because of military occupation. This has not been the case for several years now. Although meant to be a foot and cycle path, it is possible to drive round the moat, although you get a much better view on foot.\nWhen the Venetians took over Cyprus in 1489, they inherited a city that already had defensive walls, built by the Lusignans. These walls were tall and thin for defence against the siege engines and bows and arrows of the day. However, by 1489, warfare had changed. The invention of gunpowder meant that cities now had to be defended against cannon attack, and Famagusta’s walls were no longer suitable defence against the Ottomans, who were seen as the major threat, (Correctly as was seen just 80 years later).\nThe Venetians immediately started to renovate and update the walls, bringing in specialists from Venice to oversee the work. The walls and bastions were strengthened, redundant arrow slits and openings being closed up. In their place, openings were made in the walls to house cannons and other modern artillery.\nThe towers and bastions are as follows. (Clockwise from the Land Gate)\nThe Rivettina Bastion. (The Land Gate, The Ravelin or the Akkule)\nDiocare Bastion.\nMoratto Bastion.\nPulacazara Bastion.\nSan Luca Bastion.\nMartinengo Bastion. (The Tophane)\nDel Mezzo Bastion. (Martyrs’ Bastion)\nDiamante Bastion. (Karpaz Bastion)\nSignora Bastion (Ringed Enclosure)\nOthello’s Tower. (The Citadel or Castella) Originally built by the Lusignans as a moated castle outside the city wall.\nThe Sea Gate (Porta del Mare)\nCanbulat Bastion. (Arsenal)\nCompasanto Bastion. (Ringed Bastion)\nAndruzzi Bastion. (Water Bastion)\nSanta Napa Bastion. (Golden Bastion)\nThe Ravelin, Famagusta City Wall\nThe Ravelin\nThe Rivettina Bastion (Land Gate) which was the original Lusignan entrance was greatly thickened and extended.\nThe Marttinengo Bastion was built at the northwest corner of the city. This was considered the most vulnerable point of the city. It was felt that any invading force from the sea would land farther up the coast in the Salamis area, and attack from the land. The design of this bastion was such that not only did it command a field of fire landward, but its cannons could be directed along the line of the wall should any invading force get into the moat.\nThis proved so successful, that during the siege of Famagusta in 1570, the Ottomans didn’t even attempt to attack this area.\nThe walls, which are on average 30ft thick, also housed stables, arms depots and tunnels to get from one part of the wall to another. These spaces were put to good use in 1974, when the Turkish Cypriots used the walled city as a place of refuge against the Greek Cypriot militia.\nThe walls were built on existing rocky outcrops.\nWalls Built on Existing Outcrops\nThe moat was also built by the Venetians, the earth dug out being used to fill the gaps inside the walls where they had been extended.\nIf you were a military commander at the time, and were faced with the job of taking a walled city, you had three ways you could do it. You could go over the walls, or go through them. If those failed, the third course of action would be to go under them, undermining the foundations, and laying charges of gunpowder to blast a breach in the walls.\nIn order to counteract this possibility, the Venetians, where possible built the walls on top of rocky outcrops in order to protect against tunnelling, and you can see signs of this as you walk along the moat.\nIn 1570, the Ottomans attacked Cyprus, quickly taking possession of all but Famagusta. As the city would not surrender, the Ottomans laid siege to it. The siege lasted for ten months. It is said that an attacking army some 200,000 strong faced a city defended by a population of 8,000. In attacking Famagusta, the Ottoman army lost some 50,000 men, and fired some 150,000 cannon balls at the city.\nEvidence of the siege, some 450 years later\nA 450 year-old Siege Cannon Ball Still in the Wall\nYou can still see evidence of siege to this day. Inside the city, much of the damage to the churches is from this time. They were the only buildings visible above the city walls, and provided a tempting target. As you walk along the moat, take time to look at the walls. Much of the missing stonework is not from the ravages of time, but from the ravages of cannon shot. If you look carefully, you can still see the occasional cannon ball, still embedded in the walls after nearly four and a half centuries.\nThe Venetians had done their job well. The closest the Ottomans got to breaching the walls was in July, 1571, when they came near to taking the Rivetinna Bastion, and started to scale the walls. The Venetian commander, however, had anticipated this eventuality, and detonated explosives placed for such a moment, burying 1000 Ottoman soldiers.\nIt couldn’t last, of course, and in August, 1571, having lost 6000 of his 8000 soldiers, and the remainder suffering from disease and starvation, the garrison commander surrendered.\nTo this day, the walls of Famagusta have never been breached by a hostile force.",

It is also a fact that the Gas off the coast of Cyprus is very expensive to acquire, so even after the massive discovery in block 10, the line between acquisition costs, transport costs and profitable resale is a lot finer than people may realise. Whilst I am not suggesting that a cut is just handed over without any political solution, the gas find is an asset of Cyprus, the President could have demonstrated on the world stage that he is a magnanimous, pragmatic and proud Cypriot, who wants to work towards a united INCLUSIVE Cyprus.

The number of people with this disorder is highly disputed with some theories stating that it can be as high as one percent of the population. However, most experts agree that this is not the case and the actual statistics are much lower. Narcissistic personality disorder is also disputed as the cause. There are two basic theories. One being that the disorder is caused by early trauma causing developmental disorders. Another theory is that it is learned behaviour that has no basis in a clinical cause.\nIf the origin of the disease is clinical in nature and caused by early developmental issues, the hope for treatment is not good. Because it is not a psychological issue and there are no known medical treatments for the disease, if it is a physical issue, there may not be anything or much that can be done to treat it. However, if the disease is psychological in nature, there is hope for treatment. The behavior can be relearned to something that is more socially acceptable. However, those who are in treatment for this disease show slow progress if any at all.\nThe reason for this is narcissists by their nature have an inflated view of themselves. Therefore they rarely think there is a problem. Even if they are in treatment, studies show it takes years to make any significant progress. Health insurance companies have varying policies on coverage for this disorder but for the length of time treatment is needed in order to be successful, there will likely need to be a significant out of pocket expense. Narcissistic personality disorder will cause problems at home and in a career. A narcissist will not be able to sustain a healthy relationship for very long and will also have significant problems in productive activities like work or school. They will believe they have a grand life with lots of friends and an unending opportunity for wealth or fame. They will react offensively when the reality of a situation intrudes and have a tendency to blame others for anything negative that may happen in their lives.\nIdentifying Narcissistic People Early\nNarcissistic men and women are so self centred and self indulgent that they see friends and lovers as mere extensions of themselves. They are obsessed with flattery and demand to be adored and have attention to themselves at all times.\nUnfortunately, these narcissistic types are very seductive and you may at first be attracted to them without realizing what you are stepping into. Because their egos are so very fragile, they constantly crave attention which eventually puts their partner at risk of being on the loosing end of the relationship.\nTo help you with some tips on identifying whether or not he or she is a narcissistic type, ask yourself the following questions:\n1. Does he or she loose interest when they are not the center of attention?\n2. Are most conversations about them, whether you try to change the subject or not?\n3. Is your partner always fishing for compliments?\n4. If you criticize him or her, do they literally fall apart at that criticism, especially if it refers to their looks or their mistakes?\n5. Do you catch them talking about all of their supposed ‘lost loves’ whom each seemed to have had major flaws in which he or she had to break up with them?\n6. If he or she is not getting special treatment or constant attention do they get mad or have a temper tantrums? For example if when they are not waiting on fast enough in restaurants, or did not get the best seats at the movies, are they upset?\n7. Do you find a pattern of this person using people just to get what they want and then discarding them when their own needs are met?\nIf the man or women you are interested in shows any number of these types of behaviors then you may want to be careful. These are not the type of people to get involved in a relationship with if you want equal attention and love.\nClinical Features\nOpinions vary as to whether the narcissistic traits evident in in infancy, childhood, and early adolescence are pathological. Anecdotal evidence suggests that childhood abuse and trauma inflicted by parents, authority figures, or even peers provoke “secondary narcissism” and, when unresolved, may lead to the full-fledged Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) later in life.\nThis makes eminent sense as narcissism is a defense mechanism whose role is to deflect hurt and trauma from the victim’s “True Self” into a “False Self” which is omnipotent, invulnerable, and omniscient. This False Self is then used by the narcissist to garner narcissistic supply from his human environment. Narcissistic supply is any form of attention, both positive and negative and it is instrumental in the regulation of the narcissist’s labile sense of self-worth.\nPerhaps the most immediately evident trait of patients with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is their vulnerability to criticism and disagreement. Subject to negative input, real or imagined, even to a mild rebuke, a constructive suggestion, or an offer to help, they feel injured, humiliated and empty and they react with disdain (devaluation), rage, and defiance.\n“To avoid such intolerable pain, some patients with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) socially withdraw and feign false modesty and humility to mask their underlying grandiosity. Dysthymic and depressive disorders are common reactions to isolation and feelings of shame and inadequacy.”\nDue to their lack of empathy, disregard for others, exploitativeness, sense of entitlement, and constant need for attention (narcissistic supply), narcissists are rarely able to maintain functional and healthy interpersonal relationships.\nMany narcissists are over-achievers and ambitious. Some of them are even talented and skilled. But they are incapable of team work because they cannot tolerate setbacks. They are easily frustrated and demoralized and are unable to cope with disagreement and criticism. Though some narcissists have meteoric and inspiring careers, in the long-run, all of them find it difficult to maintain long-term professional achievements and the respect and appreciation of their peers. The narcissist’s fantastic grandiosity, frequently coupled with a hypomanic mood, is typically incommensurate with his or her real accomplishments (the “grandiosity gap”).\nThere are many types of narcissists: the paranoid, the depressive, the phallic, and so on.\nAn important distinction is between cerebral and somatic narcissists. The cerebrals derive their Narcissistic Supply from their intelligence or academic achievements and the somatics derive their Narcissistic Supply from their physique, exercise, physical or sexual prowess and romantic or physical “conquests”.\nAnother crucial division within the ranks of patients with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is between the classic variety (those who meet five of the nine diagnostic criteria included in the DSM), and the compensatory kind (their narcissism compensates for deep-set feelings of inferiority and lack of self-worth).\nSome narcissists are covert, or inverted narcissists. As codependents, they derive their narcissistic supply from their relationships with classic narcissists.\nTreatment and Prognosis\nTalk therapy (mainly psycho-dynamic psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioural treatment modalities) is the common treatment for patients with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). The therapy goals cluster around the need to modify the narcissist’s antisocial, inter-personally exploitative, and dysfunctional behaviours. Such re-socialisation (behaviour modification) is often successful. Medication is prescribed to control and ameliorate attendant conditions such as mood disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorders.\nThe prognosis for an adult suffering from the Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is poor, though his adaptation to life and to others can improve with treatment.",

The British faced a major political problem on the island. The indigenous Cypriots believed it their natural right to unite the island with Greece following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The British authorities carried out the first census in 1881, the total population of Cyprus was 186,173, of whom 137,631 (73.9%) were Greeks, 45,438 (24.4%) were Turks and 3,084 (1.7%) were minorities of Maronites, Latins and Armenians.[2] Bishop of Kitium Kyprianos addressed Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley upon his arrival in Larnaca in a speech on the 22nd of July 1878 saying “We (Greeks) accept the change of the government, because we believe that Great Britain will eventually help Cyprus, just like with the Ionian islands, unite Cyprus with mother Greece”.[3]\nWhile the Cypriots at first welcomed British rule hoping that they would gradually achieve prosperity, democracy and national liberation, they became disillusioned. The British imposed heavy taxes to cover the compensation which they were paying to the Sultan for having conceded Cyprus to them. Moreover, the people were not given the right to participate in the administration of the island, since all powers were reserved to the High Commissioner and to London.\nTHE AKRITAS PLAN\nThe Akritas plan (Greek: Σχέδιο Ακρίτας, Turkish: Akritas Planı) was created in 1963 by the Greek Cypriot part of the government of Cyprus with the ultimate aim of weakening the Turkish Cypriot wing of the Cypriot government and then uniting (Enosis) Cyprus with Greece.[1]\nBackground to the plan\nIn 1878 as a result of the Cyprus Convention, the United Kingdom received as a protectorate the island of Cyprus from the Ottoman Empire, in exchange for the United Kingdom’s military support to the Ottoman Empire if Russia would attempt to take possession of territories of the Ottomans in Asia.[2] Britain then administered Cyprus until 1960. In 1955, a Greek Cypriot paramilitary organization called EOKA declared a rebellion of the entire Greek population (except for the communists) of the island to expel the British forces from the island and unite with Greece on the ground of self-determination of the inhabitants, and launched an armed struggle to achieve this aim, called enosis.[3] This caused a “Crete syndrome” within the Turkish Cypriot community, as its members feared that they would be forced to leave the island like the Cretan Turks; as such, they preferred the continuation of the British rule and later, taksim, the division of the island. Due to the Turkish Cypriots’ support for the British, the EOKA leader Georgios Grivas declared them an enemy. With the support of Turkey, which favored a policy of partition, the Turkish Cypriots formed the Turkish Resistance Organization.[4]\nIn 1960, the British gave in and turned power over to the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. A power sharing constitution was created for the new Republic of Cyprus which included both Turkish and Greek Cypriots holding power in the government. Three treaties were written up to guarantee the integrity and security of the new republic: the Treaty of Establishment, the Treaty of Guarantee, and the Treaty of Alliance. According to the constitution, Cyprus was to become an independent republic with a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president with full power sharing between Turkish and Greek Cypriots.[5]\nFormation and aims\nThe Akritas plan was drawn by the minister of the interior, Polycarpos Georgadjis.[6] It is not known to what extent President Archbishop Makarios was committed to the plan.[7] The plan’s course of action was to persuade the world community that too many rights had been given to the Turkish Cypriots and that the constitution had to be rewritten if the government was to be workable. Britain and the US had to be convinced that the Turkish Cypriots did not have to be afraid of Greek Cypriot political dominance in the island.\nThe next step of the plan was to cancel international treaties that existed to safeguard the republic, including the Treaty of Guarantee and the Treaty of Alliance. If a way could be found to dissolve the treaties legally, union with Greece would be possible. The treaties had been put into place by Britain, Greece and Turkey to safeguard the republic and to protect the rights of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.\nThe plan stated that if the Turkish Cypriots resisted the changes and “attempted to block them by force”, they should be “violently subjugated before foreign powers could intervene”.[8] The ultimate aim was to change the constitution unilaterally.[9]\nIn November 1963, Greek Cypriot leader Makarios made a 13 point proposal to make the constitution more workable, which were rejected by the Turkish Cypriot Leadership on 16 December 1963. It said that the proposed amendments would undermine the constitution and weaken the Turkish Cypriot wing of the government[citation needed]. These proposals were allegedly a part of the plan.[10]\nBetween 21 and 22 December 1963, up to 133 Turkish Cypriots were killed by Greek Cypriots in what became known by Turkish Cypriots as Bloody Christmas.[11] About a quarter of the Turkish Cypriots, some 25,000 or so, subsequently fled their homes and lands and moved into enclaves.[12][13][14]\nKey themes and elements of the Akritas plan\nAccording to the copy of the plan leaked to the pro-Grivas Greek Cypriot newspaper[15] Patris, the plan consisted of two main sections, one delineating external tactics to be employed, and the other delineating internal tactics. The external tactics pointed to the Treaty of Guarantee as the first objective of an attack, with the statement that it was no longer recognized by Greek Cypriots. If the Treaty of Guarantee was abolished, there would be no legal roadblocks to enosis, which would happen through a plebiscite.[16]\nControversy and opinions\nGreek Cypriot sources have accepted the authenticity of the Akritas plan, but controversy regarding its significance and implications persists.[17] It is a subject of debate whether the plan was actually implemented by President Makarios. Frank Hoffmeister wrote that the similarity of the military and political actions foreseen in the plan and undertaken in reality was “striking”.[6] According to Paul Sant-Cassia, the plan “purported to project a plan at ethnic cleansing”, which was in parallel to the Turkish Cypriot perception that the events of 1963-64 were part of a policy of extermination.[18]\nTurkish Cypriot nationalistic narratives have presented the plan as a “blueprint for genocide”[17] and it is widely perceived as a plan for extermination in the Turkish Cypriot community.[19] The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls the plan a “conspiracy to dissolve the Republic of Cyprus, in pre-determined stages and methods, and to bring about the union of Cyprus with Greece”.[20] According to scholar Niyazi Kızılyürek, however, the meaning later given to this plan was disproportionate and the plan was a “stupid” and impractical plan that got more attention than it deserved due to propaganda. He claimed that, in accordance to the plan, ELDYK troops should have taken action, which was not the case and led to Georgadjis shouting “traitors!” in front of their camp.[19] Calling the plan “infamous”, scholar Evanthis Hatzivassiliou wrote that the aim of quick victory indicated the “confusion and wishful thinking of the Greek Cypriot side at that crucial moment”.\nThe Thirteen Amendments\n- The right of veto of the President and the Vice-President of the Republic to be abolished.\n- The Vice-President of the Republic to deputise for or replace the President of the Republic in case of his temporary absence or incapacity to perform his duties. In consequence, therefore, all the constitutional provisions in respect of joint action by the President and the Vice-President of the Republic to be modified accordingly.\n- The Greek President of the House of Representatives and its Turkish Vice-President to be elected by the House as a whole and not as at present the President by the Greek Members of the House and the Vice-President by the Turkish Members of the House.\n- The Vice-President of the House of Representatives to deputise for or replace the President of the House in case of his temporary absence or incapacity to perform his duties.\n- The constitutional provisions regarding separate majority for enactment of Laws by the House of Representatives to be abolished.\n- The constitutional provision regarding the establishment of separate Municipalities in the five main towns to be abolished. Provision should be made so that: (a) The Municipal Council in each of the aforesaid five towns shall consist of Greek and Turkish Councillors in proportion to the number of the Greek and Turkish inhabitants of such town by whom they shall be elected respectively. (b) In the Budget of each of such aforesaid towns, after deducting any expenditure required for common services, a percentage of the balance proportionate to the number of the Turkish inhabitants of such town shall be earmarked and disposed of in accordance with the wishes of the Turkish Councillors.\n- The constitutional provision regarding Courts consisting of Greek Judges to try Greeks and of Turkish Judges to try Turks and of mixed Courts consisting of Greek and Turkish Judges to try cases where the litigants are Greeks and Turks to be abolished.\n- The division of the Security Forces into Police and Gendarmerie to be abolished, (Provision to be made in case the Head of the Police is a Greek the Deputy Head to be a Turk and vice versa).\n- The numerical strength of the Security Forces and of the Army to be determined by Law and not by agreement between the President and the Vice-President of the Republic.\n- The proportion of the participation of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the composition of the Public Service and of the Forces of the Republic, i.e. the Police and the Army, to be modified in proportion to the ratio of the population of Greek and Turkish Cypriots.\n- The number of the members of the Public Service Commission to be reduced from ten to either five or seven.\n- All the decisions of the Public Service Commission to be taken by simple majority. If there is an allegation of discrimination on the unanimous request either of the Greek or of the Turkish members of the Commission, its Chairman to be bound to refer the matter to the Supreme Constitutional Court.\n- The Greek Communal Chamber to be abolished.\nCOMMENT:\nCyprus is and always has been an island nation, with a demographic that has evolved continually after more than two thousand years of occupation by foreign powers. It is an irony, that this island race has a unique character and culture as a result of this, yet it is the aspiration towards nations beyond the shores of Cyprus which was nurtured by the British and every time a Cypriot aspires to be anything other than Cypriot, they are exacerbating divisions that were created by others, for the benefit of others. If the people of Cyprus could have the fortitude and foresight to stand up and be counted as CYPRIOTS in CYPRIOT NATION, the divisions would begin to heal. The solution will never come from the politicians, it must come from the people, when the people speak out “en-mass” the politicians are powerless to stop them!",

The contrast between the incoming American administration and Britain’s current leadership could hardly be more pronounced.\nThe American president-elect emerges as a figure of remarkable dynamism, approaching his role with unmistakable eagerness and armed with bold proposals for addressing his nation’s challenges. His forthright communication style, though occasionally unrefined, represents a refreshing departure from conventional political discourse. This direct approach to engaging with ordinary citizens, whilst perhaps lacking in diplomatic finesse, has struck a chord with many who yearn for straightforward leadership.\nIn stark contrast, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer presents a markedly different figure. Critics have noted his remarkably subdued presence, characterised by a distinctly bureaucratic demeanour more reminiscent of a local government official than a national leader. One must delve deep into British political history, perhaps as far back as Stanley Baldwin’s cautious “Safety First” era, to find a premier of comparable reserve.\nHowever, the concerns extend beyond mere matters of personality. Questions of principle and integrity have increasingly come to the fore. Starmer’s record of political promises versus actual governance has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum. A particularly glaring example lies in his approach to university tuition fees. During his 2020 Labour leadership campaign, he made an unequivocal pledge to abolish these fees. Yet, in a striking reversal, his government has instead overseen their increase.\nThis pattern of divergence between promise and practice extends to other crucial policy areas, particularly immigration. His pledge to address the use of hotels for asylum seekers has been followed by an expansion of such facilities. Similarly, the migrant camp at RAF Weathersfield in Essex, which he previously committed to closing, is now scheduled for significant expansion under his leadership.\nThe incoming American president’s approach to similar challenges appears markedly different. His promises regarding border control and immigration reform carry a notable weight of conviction, suggesting a leader prepared to overcome bureaucratic resistance in pursuit of stated objectives.\nIn matters of international relations, historical parallels prove illuminating. The resolution of the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis serves as a pertinent example of how a change in leadership can alter international dynamics. Iran’s decision to release American hostages prior to Ronald Reagan’s inauguration demonstrated the impact that a reputation for decisive action can have on international relations.\nThe stark contrast between these leadership styles raises questions about Britain’s current political direction. While the American administration promises decisive action and clear direction, Britain appears to be charting a more hesitant course under its present leadership.\nThis disparity has led some to question whether Starmer’s premiership might conclude before its full term, though such speculation remains purely conjectural. What remains clear is that the contrast between these two approaches to leadership will likely continue to spark debate about the nature of effective governance in contemporary democracy.\nSummary\nKey Points: Leadership Contrasts between US and UK\nNew US Leadership:\n• Demonstrates dynamic and proactive approach\n• Known for direct, unfiltered communication style\n• Shows eagerness to implement radical changes\n• Projects confidence in tackling major issues like immigration\n• Expected to maintain strong stance on international relations\nUK Leadership under Keir Starmer:\n• Characterised by subdued, bureaucratic demeanour\n• Described as least dynamic leader since Stanley Baldwin\n• Faces criticism over broken campaign promises:\n– Reversed pledge on university tuition fees\n– Failed to deliver on asylum seeker accommodation promises\n– Expanded rather than closed RAF Weathersfield migrant camp\nKey Contrasts:\n• Leadership Style:\n– US: Bold and direct\n– UK: Reserved and bureaucratic\n• Policy Implementation:\n– US: Expected to push through promised changes\n– UK: Track record of reversing campaign pledges\n• Public Communication:\n– US: Direct engagement with ordinary citizens\n– UK: More formal, traditional approach\nInternational Relations:\n• Historical parallel drawn with 1980 Iranian hostage crisis\n• Suggestion that strong leadership can influence international behaviour\n• Implications for future diplomatic relations\nPublic Perception:\n• Growing concern over UK leadership effectiveness\n• Questions about potential early resignation\n• Debate over contrasting governance styles",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-britains-border-protection-requires-a-reassessment-of-echr-membership/content_784.html": "Why Britain’s Border Protection Requires a Reassessment of ECHR Membership\n**What is the ECHR?**\nThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international treaty established by the Council of Europe in 1950. It aims to protect and promote fundamental rights and freedoms for individuals within its member states. The convention has been ratified by most European countries and has established the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to ensure its enforcement. Some of the key rights and freedoms protected by the ECHR include:\n1. **Right to Life (Article 2):** This protects the right to life and places restrictions on the use of force by state authorities.\n2. **Prohibition of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (Article 3):** This prohibits torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n3. **Right to Liberty and Security (Article 5):** This protects against unlawful detention and provides safeguards for the rights of arrested or detained individuals.\n4. **Right to a Fair Trial (Article 6):** This ensures a fair and impartial trial process, including the right to legal representation, the presumption of innocence, and the right to examine witnesses.\n5. **Right to Respect for Private and Family Life (Article 8):** This safeguards an individual’s right to privacy, family life, and correspondence.\n6. **Freedom of Thought, Conscience, and Religion (Article 9):** This protects the freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and belief.\n7. **Freedom of Expression (Article 10):** This guarantees the right to freedom of expression, including freedom of speech and the press.\n8. **Freedom of Assembly and Association (Article 11):** This protects the right to peacefully assemble and form associations or organizations.\n9. **Right to Marry (Article 12):** This guarantees the right to marry and establish a family.\n10. **Prohibition of Discrimination (Article 14):** While not an independent right, this article prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms protected by the convention.\n11. **Right to an Effective Remedy (Article 13):** This ensures the right to an effective remedy before a national authority for violations of the convention’s rights and freedoms.\n12. **Prohibition of Abuse of Rights (Article 17):** This prevents any state from using the convention’s provisions to undermine the rights and freedoms it protects.\nThese rights and freedoms are aimed at promoting and safeguarding the dignity and human rights of individuals within the member states of the Council of Europe. The European Court of Human Rights plays a crucial role in interpreting and applying the convention, as individuals can submit complaints to the court if they believe their rights have been violated by a state party to the convention. The court’s decisions set precedents and help shape the understanding of human rights in Europe.\nIn recent years, the issue of border protection has taken center stage in Britain’s national discourse, particularly in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The government’s strategy to curb illegal Channel crossings by promptly detaining and deporting migrants has encountered a significant hurdle – human rights laws. This has led to growing calls for the UK to reconsider its membership in the ECHR and take control of its border protection strategies.\n**The Challenge of Human Rights Laws**\nAt the heart of the matter lies a simple plan: swiftly detain and deport migrants entering Britain illegally, either to their home countries or to Rwanda. While the High Court has deemed the Rwanda deportation scheme lawful, the threat of legal challenges looms. Moreover, while Rwanda has been generally regarded as safe for deported migrants, individual circumstances can still lead to claims that hinder deportation. This has created an obstacle; if deportation isn’t imminent, detention is deemed unlawful.\nGovernment officials, including Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Suella Braverman, have expressed their willingness to withdraw from the ECHR in order to address these challenges. However, this stance has sparked controversy, with some arguing that withdrawal would isolate Britain and liken it to countries with dubious human rights records like Russia and Belarus. Detractors also point out that the Convention is a significant British achievement, inspired by Winston Churchill and drafted by David Maxwell Fyfe.\n**Rethinking the Arguments**\nCritics of withdrawal have raised concerns about the efficiency of the Home Office’s asylum claim processing. They argue that the problem lies in the speed of processing claims, not the Convention itself. However, accelerating decision-making could inadvertently lead to higher acceptance rates and consequently attract more migrants seeking permanent residence in the UK. The real challenge is the lack of a clear message that illegal migrants will face swift removal – a task hampered by rights-based claims that impede detention and deportation.\nLeaving the Convention wouldn’t align Britain with oppressive regimes. Countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have demonstrated that stable liberal democracies can safeguard individual rights without supranational courts imposing interpretations that deviate from the original intent of these rights.\n**Evolution of the ECHR**\nOriginally conceived as a safeguard against totalitarianism and extreme ideologies, the ECHR has evolved into a mechanism for enforcing domestic legal standards. Criminals, terrorists, and illegal immigrants have exploited the Convention to challenge law enforcement efforts, creating a contentious situation. What was once a collective defense against despotism has turned into a European bill of rights, often undermining the authority of sovereign nations to uphold their laws.\n**Democratic Deficit and Constitutional Concerns**\nThe growing power of the European Court of Human Rights has created a democratic deficit, challenging the core principle of British constitutional sovereignty. Unlike the British model, where laws can be changed by elected representatives, the Convention’s case law remains impervious to such modifications. Despite promises that the Human Rights Act would bring rights home, it has, in fact, deepened the UK’s reliance on Strasbourg’s rulings.\n**A Call for Reform**\nThe urgency to address these issues has led some to suggest reforming or replacing the Human Rights Act. Tightening the law within the boundaries of the Convention, creating exemptions from Convention rights, and altering deportation claim procedures are all potential avenues. Nevertheless, as long as Britain remains bound by the ECHR, Strasbourg’s influence persists, with the ability to veto British decisions even in matters crucial to national security.\n**The Path Forward**\nThe question of Britain’s border protection in the context of its membership in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) presents a multifaceted challenge that demands careful consideration. The ECHR, originally designed to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms, has evolved over time, raising concerns about its impact on national sovereignty and the efficient enforcement of domestic laws. The tension between detaining and deporting illegal migrants while adhering to human rights standards has prompted calls for a reassessment of ECHR membership.\nThe current debate centers on the balance between protecting national security and upholding individual rights. The proposition to withdraw from the ECHR to gain more control over border protection strategies is met with both support and opposition. Detractors argue that such a move could isolate Britain and weaken its commitment to human rights, while proponents emphasize the need for effective border control in the face of increasing illegal migrations.\nThe complexity lies in the fact that the issue extends beyond the Convention itself. The efficiency of the Home Office’s asylum claim processing, the concern of attracting more migrants through faster decision-making, and the evolving role of the European Court of Human Rights all contribute to the intricate landscape of this debate. There is recognition that reforming or replacing the Human Rights Act could be a potential solution, offering a middle ground between adhering to international standards and protecting national sovereignty.\nIn navigating this complex terrain, it is essential for policymakers to find a balanced approach that respects human rights, preserves British values, and ensures effective border protection. Striking this equilibrium will necessitate rigorous evaluation, legal reforms, and open discourse. Ultimately, the path forward must be guided by a commitment to both individual rights and the security of the nation. The outcome of this deliberation will significantly shape the trajectory of border protection strategies in the UK, setting a precedent for how liberal democracies can address the evolving challenges at the intersection of human rights and national security.",

I’m hoping by this point that it is clear that I’m not directing my attention at any person or persons, on the contrary overall I’m actually defending migrants and quite concerned about the effect that the media portrayal of what’s happening is having on people within this country myself included, because as someone who was born here, but to foreign parents, I find the prospect that over the next decade or two, as I enter old age if not already there, I do so in a climate where everybody is angry with everyone and there’s so much hostility.\nI’m beginning to feel that this is deeply misplaced and our attention should actually be focused on those who are making this happen, so here’s some of your comments and I’d like to respond to:\nFirst one was that this appeared or was highlighted in order to win Brexit votes.\nYes of course that did happen, but bear in mind that issues with the EU go back decades not just not just to 2016. it is a fact that Margaret\nThatcher and Edward Heath lied to the nation when they took us into the so-called Common Market, they knew very well what the agenda was, but they admitted that they kept the intention of ever closer union from the British public, the British public did not subsequently vote on the Maastricht treaty, the Lisbon treaty, or anything else that happened, but yes of course there was an element, large or small who did use immigration in order to argue for brexit, but then on the contrary there was people on the remainer side who also exploited certain issues to make their arguments, but yes of course I will concede that but I don’t see that as being the the root cause of where we are now.\nUK slave wage began with immigration\nThat to a point again I will agree with. In 2004 when there was the last major enlargement of the EU that’s when we saw a massive influx of people from Poland, Romania, Latvia and Lithuania Etc. I know people who were on minimum wage at the time who suddenly were plunged below the poverty line because there were many people on minimum wage who relied on their overtime at a slightly higher rate to make up their salary, to take it from what was not really a living wage into one that was closer to a living wage if not if still not adequate the minute the EU enlarged all of these people suddenly lost their overtime, the big corporations didn’t literally dismiss people on mass but what they did\nindirectly is they stopped offering people over time which I think they were powerless to do anything about, because they had access to a large influx of people who were more than happy to work at minimum wage once again who benefits from a large influx of immigration it is\nthe corporations because large volumes of immigration make people dispensable they lower the worth of people even those people who are\nunskilled who are at the bottom of the pay chain and they’re the ones who did suffer the most so there is an argument and for most people in business the first argument is not just lack of labour, but also lack of cheap labour and that is a very real argument.\nPeople who have been here for generations are now worried:\nI agree and I’m one of them, I’m very very concerned that what is happening is being portrayed as an invasion and the degree of anger and\nhostility throughout the country is at the highest that I’ve ever known, to a degree that we should all be concerned and it should not be about people who are here living part of our community part of our society but the media are directing our attention at that but once again as I said in my video.\nI feel that that is misdirection the government is implementing is on purpose:\nAbsolutely, I believe this is not about an issue about deportation, it is an issue about borders. Anyone who enters any Sovereign Nation\nwithout a passport is committing a crime, unless they are a genuine Asylum Seekers. Many other countries do not tolerate anybody crossing their borders and their initial response would be to place those who cross their borders under arrest and if those arrested are subsequently\nproved to be valid Asylum Seekers, then they are processed accordingly I cannot believe that people can arrive here on dinghies in their thousands over the year and that 50,000 ton naval ships are no match for these dinghies and that they cannot stop them before they reach our shores and enforce a penalty on all of those who are deemed to have arrived here illegally.\nThose who have arrived here illegally once again that doesn’t affect genuine Asylum Seekers then realistically if the government were doing its job those people would go to prison no remission no parole no repatriation that would send a strong message but what do they do\nthey put them all in hotels and one by one they’ll all be released into the community because nobody is being deported. Those of us already here should Unite I believe everyone should Unite whenever any of us turns on each other we are playing directly into the hands of the investigators whoever they may be it is important that we do not allow this toxic anger and hate that is being planted on us on a national scale to poison our hearts and minds, divide us all and make us turn on each other.\nit is important for us I believe to focus our attention on those people who were elected under one policy and they then go out to sell out the\nvery electorate who voted them in and I will cover my thoughts on this in another video.\nIn part two of my responses to your comments on my video about immigration I needed a separate video to respond to this very relevant comment because I need to actually refer to something that’s happened in the past because it is quite relevant, the comment was soldiers for when there is civil unrest now that may sound quite like a conspiracy theory, but I believe that it’s not, here’s an example to consider:\nA few years ago traffic wardens were restructured and they are now civil Enforcement Officers, with far more powers, mobile body cameras on them, they report people for all sorts of offences and they are well on their way to following the Chinese social credits idea, because civil enforcement officers are actually there to be able to be instantly turned into almost the hand of the government on every street corner and a lot of the people who are being taken in to work as civil enforcement officers are people who’ve moved here from abroad who maybe, will be less hesitant to turn on their local neighbours in that event.\nI’d also like to point out something that actually happened in the past and it may seem more relevant now than ever, the reason I could point to this is through family, my parents and everybody else I know.\nIn 1955 in Cyprus, there was a struggle for independence from the British. At the time, the population of Cyprus was predominantly Greek Cypriot with a minority Turkish Cypriots and there were also Maronites and Armenians along with one or two other groups. Once things began to turn really nasty, bearing in mind there was extreme poverty in the island at the time, which got worse through the struggle, whether that was by coincidence or by design, who knows, but what the British actually did at the time was, they began to recruit Turkish\nCypriots to guard any captive Greek Cypriots.\nIt can be understood at the time that the combination of stick and carrot would have worked, because people were so poor they had to feed their family but that had the effect of causing division and resentment between the two communities. Eventually the British agreed to give\nCyprus Independence and they sat down blessed them to help create the Constitution of Cyprus and in Article 2 of that Constitution they actually specified that within three months every citizen in Cyprus has to decide if they are Greek Cypriot or if they are Turkish Cypriot.\nLet’s bear in mind that in 1955 when the struggle began, all the people of Cyprus who were just Cypriots who were fighting for Independence\ntogether, but within five years they were suddenly two communities, with tension between them and it was written in the Constitution which is still there today, that they had to decide whether they were one Community or another.\nThe British government in its foreign policy which it implemented in many countries around the world successfully divided the population of Cyprus and for those of you who know what happened, relations deteriorated and deteriorated .and the island is now partitioned. We also know from Trevor Philips, in the documentary called “the things we say about race that are true” he actually admitted now that his policy of diverse communities, actually did more harm than good, because it divided people rather than create a United national identity.\nThe term national identity is almost a No-No nowadays because anybody who even utters the word national identity is instantly ostracized and in some places even cancelled. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with people who are here wherever they have come from to actually be part of the greater community of being British. I know that I love it and I’m very, very proud of it to be a part of it and I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s not something that I feel is enforced on me, it’s something that I am happy to be a part of and I’m very proud of that, so I feel that this division has been put there for a purpose and I do feel that the numbers of people that\nare arriving here are arriving because one way or another the government has signalled that there is an Open Door, regardless of their rhetoric and those who come, are people and people are good, bad and ugly, they vary but the media obviously picks on the ones that serve\ntheir purpose to create hysteria, create division and create hate. I believe that we need to respond to this, but we must never react!\nUntil recently, there was a particular chap, (who will remain un-named) he was head of a right-wing political movement, a real troublemaker he would actually go to places such as Luton and he would literally be in the face of minorities insulting them to provoke a reaction, now while he was receiving a reaction that was hostile, that was aggressive, it was serving his purpose, because every time any Community reacted with hostility or aggression, it didn’t reflect well on them.\nThe most effective punishment or course of events rather, for this man was when he was literally given the opportunity to sit down and make his argument in a calm environment on national TV. I believe he appeared on good morning Britain and one or two other places, and he made himself look a complete and utter idiot!\nwhat can we draw from that? What I believe we we can draw from this is that if we simply gag people who are extreme, we are actually playing into their hands, sometimes we need to get these people in a forum where they can speak freely and be questioned on their chain of\nthought, because that way their argument falls apart for all to see. It shouldn’t be about hostility and we mustn’t allow this to divide us.\nThe only way that we will deal with this and make changes would be to play the politicians at their own game. We know it is notoriously difficult in this country for any new party to make headway, because we have a ‘first past the post system’ so of course for a new party to win\npower at the moment would be virtually impossible, but individuals do not need to control the whole of parliament to have the controlling hand to be able to force the government to bring them to account for what they are doing.\nWe saw this in the 2019 election with the Brexit party, where once the conservatives were aware that they stood to lose every marginal seat in the country, they changed their tune, but once they got into power, realistically they sold the country out and now they are doing it to us again.\nThey have replaced our prime minister without our mandate, and the current prime minister is literally feathering his own nest and the nest of those who he serves. He is not serving the British public.\nI have a lot more to say on this, so I’ll be back in another video see you soon.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_deciphering-the-married-womens-property-act-1882/content_811.html": "Deciphering the Married Women’s Property Act 1882\nOn the 18th of August each year, we should be celebrating the Married Women’s Property Act 1882, which was the passing of a legal act that was one of the most significant changes in the structure of our society, for the first time married women would no longer be the chattels of their husbands, but individuals in their own right.\nIt took further four decades before women were allowed to vote, a further decade before they were permitted to vote on equal terms as men, and then another four decades before the Sex discrimination act of 1975 was passed.\nWhilst 1882 may seem a long time ago, for anyone aged 70, it is just twice their age, and that would take us back to a time when married women had no rights whatsoever, we have come so far and yet, on the anniversary of this monumental change in our society, I am normally unable to find anything in the media, yet I can easily find an article about gender, racism and Islamophobia.\nIn the meantime, the incidence of misogyny and attacks on women in the UK are increasing at an alarmin rate, we are regreasing and successive administrations in recent history have facilitated this sinister recalibration of our society’s moral compass.\nWhy was the act passed?\nThe purpose of the Married Women’s Property Act 1882 was to fundamentally change the legal status of married women in relation to property and financial matters in the UK. Before this Act, married women essentially had no legal existence separate from their husbands under the doctrine of “coverture” – their legal identity was literally “covered” by their husband’s.\nSummary of the Married Women’s Property Act 1882\nThe Act had several key aims:\n1. To give married women legal independence by allowing them to own and control their own property. Before this, when a woman married, virtually all her property automatically became her husband’s.\n2. To protect women’s economic interests by letting them keep their own wages and earnings. Previously, any money a married woman earned legally belonged to her husband.\n3. To establish married women as separate legal entities who could enter into contracts, sue and be sued independently of their husbands.\n4. To provide women with financial security by allowing them to maintain their own bank accounts and investments, and take out insurance policies.\n5. To protect women’s inheritance rights by ensuring they could keep property they inherited both before and after marriage.\n6. To give married women the same commercial rights as single women (known as “feme sole” in legal terms), including the ability to run businesses.\nThe Act was revolutionary for its time as it dismantled a significant portion of the coverture doctrine that had governed marriage law for centuries. It represented a major step forward in women’s rights and economic independence in Victorian Britain, though it’s worth noting that it didn’t apply to Scotland, which had its own separate legal system with different provisions for married women’s property rights.\nThis Act laid important groundwork for women’s economic emancipation and was part of the broader movement for women’s rights in the 19th century. It marked a shift from viewing married women as essentially their husband’s property to recognizing them as independent legal persons capable of owning and managing their own assets.\nKey Provisions:\n1. Property Rights\n– Married women gained the right to own, buy, and sell property in their own name, just like single women could\n– They could manage their property without needing their husband’s permission or a trustee\n– This applied to both real estate and personal property\n2. Financial Independence\n– Married women could enter into contracts on their own\n– They could sue or be sued independently of their husband\n– They could keep their own wages and earnings\n– They could have their own bank accounts and investments\n– They could run their own businesses and would be subject to bankruptcy laws just like anyone else\n3. Marriage and Property\n– Women who married after this Act came into effect could keep all property they owned before marriage\n– They could also keep anything they earned or inherited after marriage\n– Women who were already married when the Act came into effect could keep any new property they acquired after the Act started\n4. Investment and Banking\n– Any stocks, shares, bank deposits, or investments in a married woman’s name were considered her separate property\n– She could manage these investments without her husband’s involvement\n– Banks and companies were protected if they dealt directly with married women\n5. Insurance\n– Women could take out life insurance policies on themselves or their husbands\n– Insurance policies could be set up to benefit wives and children specifically\n– These insurance benefits would be protected from creditors\n6. Legal Rights\n– Women could pursue both civil and criminal cases to protect their property\n– They could take legal action against anyone, including their husbands\n– However, wives couldn’t pursue criminal charges against husbands while living together, except in specific circumstances\n7. Debts and Liabilities\n– Women remained responsible for any debts they had before marriage\n– Husbands were only liable for their wives’ pre-marriage debts up to the value of any property they received through their wife\n– Couples could be sued jointly for the wife’s pre-marriage debts\n8. Family Responsibilities\n– Married women with their own property became legally responsible for maintaining their husband if he became dependent on poor relief\n– They also became responsible for maintaining their children and grandchildren, though this didn’t remove the husband’s existing obligations\nThe Act came into effect on January 1, 1883, and applied everywhere in the UK except Scotland. It replaced earlier married women’s property laws from 1870 and 1874.\nThis legislation marked a significant shift in women’s rights, giving married women legal and financial independence they had never had before in British history.\nFull text of Married Women’s Property Act 1882\n1882 CHAPTER 75\nAn Act to consolidate and amend the Acts relating to the Property of Married Women.\n[18th August

payable under policy of assurance not to form part of estate of the insured\nA married woman may by virtue of the power of making contracts herein-before contained effect a policy upon her own life or the life of her husband for her separate use; and the same and all benefit thereof shall enure accordingly.\nA policy of assurance effected by any man on his own life, and expressed to be for the benefit of his wife, or of his children, or of his wife and children, or any of them, or by any woman on her own life, and expressed to be for the benefit of her husband, or of her children, or of her husband and children, or any of them, shall create a trust in favour of the objects therein named, and the moneys payable under any such policy shall not, so long as any object of the trust remains unperformed, form part of the estate of the insured, or be subject to his or her debts: Provided, that if it shall be proved that the policy was effected and the premiums paid with intent to defraud the creditors of the insured, they shall be entitled to receive, out of the moneys payable under the policy, a sum equal to the premiums so paid. The insured may by the policy, or by any memorandum under his or her hand, appoint a trustee or trustees of the moneys payable under the policy, and from time to time appoint a new trustee or new trustees thereof, and may make provision for the appointment of a new trustee or new trustees thereof, and for the investment of the moneys payable under any such policy. In default of any such appointment of a trustee, such policy, immediately on its being effected, shall vest in the insured and his or her legal personal representatives, in trust for the purposes aforesaid. If, at the time of the death of the insured, or at any time afterwards, there shall be no trustee, or it shall be expedient to appoint a new trustee or new trustees, a trustee or trustees or a new trustee or new trustees may be appointed by any court having jurisdiction under the provisions of the [13 & 14 Vict. c. 60.] Trustee Act, 1850, or the Acts amending and extending the same. The receipt of a trustee or trustees duly appointed, or, in default of any such appointment, or in default of notice to the insurance office, the receipt of the legal personal representative of the insured shall be a discharge to the office for the sum secured by the policy, or for the value thereof, in whole or in part.\n12 Remedies of married women for protection and security of separate property\nEvery woman, whether married before or after this Act, shall have in her own name against all persons whomsoever, including her husband, the same civil remedies, and also (subject, as regards her husband, to the proviso herein-after contained) the same remedies and redress by way of criminal proceedings, for the protection and security of her own separate property, as if such property belonged to her as a feme sole, but, except as aforesaid, no husband or wife shall be entitled to sue the other for a tort. In any indictment or other proceeding under this section it shall be sufficient to allege such property to be her property; and in any proceeding under this section a husband or wife shall be competent to give evidence against each other, any statute or rule of law to the contrary notwithstanding: Provided always, that no criminal proceeding shall be taken by any wife against her husband by virtue of this Act while they are living together, as to or concerning any property claimed by her, nor while they are living apart, as to or confining any act done by the husband while they were living together, concerning property claimed by the wife, unless such property shall have been wrongfully taken by the husband when leaving or deserting, or about to leave or desert, his wife.\n13 Wife’s ante-nuptial debts and liabilities\nA woman after her marriage shall continue to be liable in respect and to the extent of her separate property for all debts contracted, and all contracts entered into or wrongs committed by her before her marriage, including any sums for which she may be liable as a contributory, either before or after she has been placed on the list of contributories, tinder and by virtue of the Acts relating to joint stock companies;

but no restriction against anticipation contained in any settlement or agreement for a settlement of a woman’s own property to be made or entered into by herself shall have any validity against debts contracted by her before marriage, and no settlement or agreement for a settlement shall have any greater force or validity against creditors of such woman than a like settlement or agreement for a settlement made or entered into by a man would have against his creditors.\n20 Married woman to be liable to the parish for the maintenance of her husband\nWhere in England the husband of any woman having separate property becomes chargeable to any union or parish, the justices having jurisdiction in such union or parish may, in petty sessions assembled, upon application of the guardians of the poor, issue a summons against the wife, and make and enforce such order against her for the maintenance of her husband out of such separate property as by the thirty-third section of the [31 & 32 Vict. c. 122.] Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868, they may now make and enforce against a husband for the maintenance of his wife if she becomes chargeable to any union or parish.

They argued that the foreclosures framework approved a year ago in July 2018 had given banks too many weapons against borrowers and last month’s amendments redressed the balance.\nThe president referred the embattled bills on foreclosures that have been deemed as unconstitutional. The changes made by opposition parties on July 12, would defang the banks’ ability to recoup loans that have gone bad by making it more difficult to repossess mortgaged properties.\nThe loans in question were sold off for just 20% of their value, so why is Hellenic Bank and Altamira not passing this on to the borrower?\nCOMMENT\nThe loans in question were sold off for 20% of their value to, Hellenic and Altamira asset management. Before passing judgement we need to take on board the fact that most of these loans were found to have been either illegal or in breach of banking laws in the first place.\nThe Banks have instigated a stranglehold on innocent people be firstly refusing to transparent in their policies, refusing to negotiate with people on the loans themselves and most importantly, subjecting people to outrageous overcharges that are nearly always wiped out when the borrower has the means to contest them through the courts.\nThis brings me to the second point, the banks were obviously, not only in full support of the changes to the legal defence fee structure, but they were actually lobbying for it. this has resulting in a massive up-scaling of court fees for people just to respond to court action, making it even hard for innocent people to force the banks to account for their actions in a court. For example, a case involving a sum of between €100,00 and €500,000 will cost €2,250.00 JUST TO RESPOND.\nIt would have been more prudent for the Banks and Altamira to simply offer restructured loans at a little higher than they were sold for, say 30% as proposed by the MP Kostas Efstathiou before parliament this week.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_lifeboat-relationships/content_503.html": "According to Urban Dictionary:\nLifeboat RelationshipNoun,\nA side relationship created before the end of a relationship that the cheater transitions to after the break up.\nIs this strictly true? Well, not really, passenger in a lifeboat relationship may in reality not be cheating, that is their relationship with their previous partner may have ended, but they are not over it. I have always said, that in emotional terms, you are still in a relationship with someone until you have let go, even if they are not around, so although no act of deceit is being perpetrated, the ‘lifeboat passenger’ is left on an emotional desert island, they are stranded and unable to make it on their own, they need rescuing.\nThis is where the lifeboat relationship becomes a useful, albeit frequently unplanned stepping stone to emotional recovery. When we are hurt, we can all seek consolation from friends, both new and old, as we are very much life a leaf in the wind.\nHowever, these relationships are often, not founded in the normal way. because the passenger has not been drawn to the lifeboat because they find them attractive, or because they want to be with them, they are drawn to the feeling of compassion, sympathy, understanding and last but not least, a very accommodating listener.\nFor those very reasons, the ‘Cheaters and the Beaters’ are never lifeboats, because they are the ones who leave their partners emotionally destitute, they do no have compassion and they have no time for sympathy, but sadly, for reasons that may be primitive, yet still subconsciously relevant after so much evolution, the victims are still drawn to them.\nSo how does this lifeboat relationship progress?\nIn the first instance, it can begin with a few jokes, some laughter, a feeling of making the passenger forget their problems, therefore, they may temporarily feel a little better. As time goes by, the passenger feels safe and secure whenever they make contact with the lifeboat, they need their daily fix of sympathy and reassurance. The interaction may be purely platonic, messages, phone calls and the odd coffee, it could even become sexual, but even then, it is not always a mutual display of emotional expression. It is often a situation of two opposing halves, for one, it is about wanting to be the love of the other’s life, yet for the other, it is about FORGETTING the love of their life.\nRelationships founded on quicksand rarely succeed\nAs time goes by, the dynamics of these relationships can change, as the lifeboat becomes increasingly emotionally involved and the passenger becomes increasingly emotionally free. This become more profound as the lifeboat is taking the passenger closer to ‘Dry Land’ or what is actually, emotional recovery.\nAs this happens, the passenger invariably begins to view the lifeboat in a different way, they gradually become the person they want around, but do not necessarily want to be with. As the process continues, the lifeboat will reach dry land at some point and the passenger has reached a point of emotional recovery, so they jump off and more often than not, they head straight for the ‘Beaters and the Cheaters’ who put them there in the first place.\nSo what becomes of the lifeboat?\nThe lifeboat is now left empty, used and abused, sometimes they may continue to offer kindness and support in a form of blind hope, sometimes they may accept reality and endeavour to walk away, but there is one problem here, the passenger may have not completely recovered, they only perceive that they have thanks to the support of the lifeboat and when it seems that the lifeboat is about to leave, the passenger can often play on their feelings so that they will stay, they are the passenger’s support, their strength, confidant and their feel better fix.\nBy their very nature, the lifeboats are kind, caring, sincere and emotional, otherwise they would have never been in that position in the first place. so sadly the effect of this drain on their emotions can b very destructive and very painful, because the longer they are used, the more they have given and the harder it is to turn their back on the passenger.\nSadly, the true reality is that the passengers will continue to ‘Island hop’ jumping from one lifeboat to another, each time, they leave a trail of hurt and damage behind them, yet each time they will also be drawn to the very situation that they previously ran from, so the cycle continues.\nHow can the lifeboat recover?\nThe only way to recover is to take stock of reality, to admit that you have been a lifeboat, if only to yourself and to WALK AWAY! Once you have left the passenger stranded, they will inevitably find another lifeboat, but they will also have no choice but to set you free, which you must do, or you will remain at the mercy of another person’s needs. The true foundations of a relationship are based on being wanted………not needed!",

But remember, it’s essential to infuse your own voice and perspective into your work.\n2. Endless Topic Ideas\nOnce you have your chapters outlined, you can take it a step further. Ask Chat GPT to “suggest 10 sub-chapters for Chapter One: Understanding Coercion.” Repeat this process for each chapter, and suddenly, you have a hundred topics to work with. This feature has been a game-changer for me when writing articles.\n3. Crafting Articles with Authority\nIf you need to write about a topic but want to put it in your own words, Chat GPT can help. Ask it to “suggest bullet points for an article on [topic],” and it will provide you with a concise outline to work from. This way, you can expand your knowledge and tackle the subject matter with authority.\nUnleashing Creativity\nAI isn’t just for serious tasks; it can also help you get creative:\n4. Crafting Fiction\nWant to flex your creative muscles? Ask Chat GPT to “write a funny story about the fat estate agents from Northampton called Anthony who loves chocolate.” In no time, you’ll have a whimsical tale to entertain your readers.\n5. Adding New Elements\nBut why stop there? Challenge Chat GPT to “rewrite this story and include a funny episode with a dog called Buster.” It seamlessly incorporates new elements into the narrative, showing its adaptability and creativity.\nAI in Technical Fields\nFor the tech-savvy among us, AI can be a remarkable asset:\n6.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_mps-seek-say-on-golden-visas/content_883.html": "MPs seek say on ‘golden visas’\nA LEGISLATIVE proposal is to be tabled to the House plenum in January aiming to give parliament a say in the criteria governing the issuing of passports to foreign nationals under the citizenship-by-investment scheme. The bill, authored by the Greens, is expected to go before the plenary session on January 11, the first session following the Christmas recess.\nIt stipulates that the criteria for these naturalisations need to be submitted by the government to parliament, before they are published in the government gazette. Currently, the terms and conditions for the citizenship-by-investment programme are determined by the cabinet, with no further scrutiny.\nIn prior discussions in parliament, the interior ministry said it was opposed to the Greens’ bill, arguing that it would deprive the government of the flexibility in periodically updating or revising the naturalisation scheme. Ruling Disy said also they are against the provisions of the bill, while main opposition Akel are in favour.\nThe Greens tabled the proposal after another bill they had submitted – mandating the publishing of the names of foreign investors granted passports – failed to muster support in committee. In October, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development placed Cyprus’ so-called ‘golden passport’ programme on a blacklist of schemes identified as posing a threat to international efforts to combat tax evasion.\nMy opinion\nIs this what it has come to? We sold our soul to the EU and now we are prostituting our land for profit, selling off land that was for the main part owned by Cypriots in the past, much of which was placed in the name of the Church for tax reasons under the Ottomans, but was subsequently kept by the church and now, in partnership with corrupt developers, it is being sold off to people who do not have nexus with Cyprus, people who do not care, people who are only interested in gaining a foothold in Europe.\nThis is yet another shameful scandal for Cyprus, this administration (and those that preceded it) have NO IDEA about implementing effective and unifying Nation building policies, no….they only care about profit and pulling the ladder up, but meanwhile, hardworking Cypriots struggle with pitiful salaries and overpriced property prices created by a bubble that has no logical basis, no form foundations and one that will surely burst, taking down innocent people with it, but the instigators will not suffer, just as the instigators of the crisis that resulted in the THEFT of innocent people’s bank deposits did not affect them.\nI feel that this ‘Golden Visa’ policy’ will not end well. Cyprus is a small island and we cannot keep selling off to non-Cypriots, that is not racist, that is not divisive, it is based on a desire to avoid being overrun and pushed out.\nWhat I find to be the greatest tragedy, on the note of Nation building is that there is not and never has been any inclusive policy to unite Cypriots, to make it easier for them to move to Cyprus, live in Cyprus and most importantly offer their children a state English speaking school. In fact, English was actually REMOVED as an official language back in the 80s, making it even harder for Cypriots who are living outside of Cyprus to return.\nWhat saddens me the most, is that this administration is willing to sell its soul to people who have no interest in Cyprus whatsoever, yet they will do NOTHING to encourage a unified Cypriot Demography. If this continues, Cyprus as we know it will cease to exist and one day, those of us who remain will wake up strangers in our own land.",

This proposal, which has ignited a firestorm of criticism and debate, comes amidst a series of policy shifts that have left many questioning the party’s approach to the ongoing migration crisis.\nThe suggestion to house migrants in private homes is just the latest in a string of contentious decisions by Labour. Recently, the party announced plans to scrap the Rwanda scheme, a policy that, despite its controversies, was seen by some as a necessary measure to address the issue of illegal channel crossings. The Rwanda plan, which aimed to send asylum seekers to the East African nation for processing, was criticised by human rights organisations but supported by those seeking stricter controls on immigration.\nAdding to the controversy, Labour has also declared its intention to close the Bibby Stockholm barge accommodation. This floating facility, moored off the Dorset coast, was introduced as a temporary measure to house asylum seekers and ease the pressure on hotels. Its planned closure has raised questions about where these individuals will be housed in the future.\nThese policy changes have led to growing concerns about the potential release of up to 990,000 individuals who entered the country illegally into British communities. Critics argue that this approach prioritises the needs of migrants over those of British citizens who are grappling with a cost of living crisis, homelessness, and strained public services.\nThe suggestion that British people should take migrants into their homes has been met with particular outrage. Many view it as an affront to hardworking citizens who are already struggling to make ends meet. There are fears that such a policy could lead to social tensions, safety concerns, and further strain on local communities that are already feeling the impact of increased migration.\nSome critics have drawn parallels to a reported incident in Germany, where migrants were allegedly placed in private homes with spare rooms. While details of this incident remain unclear, with some questioning its veracity, the mere suggestion of such a policy has struck a nerve with many Britons who value their privacy and autonomy.\nThe debate has been further inflamed by a recently circulated video showing a councillor in Berkshire proudly showcasing newly converted flats intended solely for migrants. This has intensified discussions about housing priorities and resource allocation, with many questioning why such accommodations are not being made available to homeless British citizens or those on long-standing council house waiting lists.\nCritics of the current approach to migration have used strong language to describe what they see as an existential threat to British culture and society. Terms such as “invasion” and “demographic genocide” have been employed, reflecting the depth of concern among some segments of the population. These individuals argue that the current policies are part of a larger agenda to fundamentally alter the demographic structure of the UK, a claim that proponents of more open migration policies vehemently deny.\nThe controversy extends far beyond housing issues. There are growing concerns about the strain on public services, including healthcare and education. Many argue that the influx of migrants is putting unsustainable pressure on the NHS, with reports of long waiting times and difficulties in accessing GP appointments being attributed, in part, to increased demand from new arrivals.\nIntegration challenges are another point of contention. Critics argue that the rapid influx of individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds is making it difficult for communities to maintain social cohesion. They point to the formation of what they term “parallel societies” in some urban areas, where migrants may not fully integrate into mainstream British culture.\nThe potential for increased crime rates is another concern often raised in these debates. While statistics on the relationship between immigration and crime are often contested, high-profile incidents involving migrants have fueled public anxiety and contributed to a sense of unease in some communities.\nAdvocates for stricter immigration controls are calling for immediate action to prevent what they see as the erosion of British culture and society. Some are proposing grassroots campaigns and petitions to voice opposition to these policies. There are calls for a more robust border control system, faster processing of asylum claims, and more effective measures to deport those whose claims are rejected.\nOn the other side of the debate, proponents of more open migration policies argue that the UK has a moral obligation to help those fleeing war, persecution, and economic hardship. They point to the potential economic benefits of migration, including filling labour shortages in key sectors such as healthcare and agriculture. These advocates call for a more compassionate approach to the migration issue, arguing that diversity enriches British society and that fears about the impact of migration are often exaggerated.\nThe Labour Party’s stance on migration has also raised questions about its electoral strategy. Some political analysts suggest that the party is attempting to appeal to more liberal, urban voters while potentially alienating its traditional working-class base. This balancing act reflects the complex and often contradictory attitudes towards immigration within British society.\nAs tensions continue to rise, there are growing calls for a more balanced approach to migration that prioritises the needs of British citizens while addressing genuine asylum cases. However, finding common ground on this issue remains a significant challenge. The debate over migration touches on fundamental questions of national identity, social cohesion, and the country’s place in an increasingly interconnected world.\nThe controversy has also sparked discussions about the role of media in shaping public perceptions of migration. Some argue that sensationalist reporting and a focus on negative stories have contributed to an atmosphere of fear and hostility towards migrants. Others contend that the media has a responsibility to report on the challenges and concerns associated with increased migration.\nAs the debate rages on, it’s clear that the issue of migration will continue to be a defining political and social issue for the UK in the years to come. The Labour Party’s recent proposals have brought these tensions to the fore, highlighting the deep divisions within British society over how to address this complex and emotive issue. Whether a consensus can be reached remains to be seen, but what is certain is that the conversation about migration, its impacts, and the country’s response to it will remain at the heart of British political discourse for the foreseeable future.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-disaster/content_506.html": "The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Disaster\nThe progressive left in the United States has hijacked the notions of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and turned them into weapons of mass destruction. What used to be positive ideas about accepting people from all backgrounds has become a movement obsessed with unequal outcomes based on race, sex and gender identity. This ideological shift is creating division and harming institutions across the country.\nWhat DEI Used to Mean\nIn the past, diversity meant that people of different backgrounds were free to join a group or organisation. It was about appreciating and accepting that people come from different races, religions, nationalities, etc. Equity used to refer to enforcing equal standards and treatment for all individuals and groups. The focus was on fairness and equal opportunity. Inclusion originally meant allowing people of every identity and background to participate in something. The goal was including everyone regardless of their differences.\nHow DEI is Used Now\nIn the context of the modern DEI movement, these terms have come to represent something very different. Rather than diversity for its own sake, the aim now is diversity of outcome. Equity no longer means equal standards but instead unequal standards designed to achieve equal results across groups. Inclusion has shifted from welcoming all people to selectively including or excluding based on race, gender and other attributes.\nEssentially, DEI has become a movement focused on applying unequal standards in order to ensure preferential outcomes for certain demographic groups. It aims to advance non-whites, women, LGBTQ+ individuals and other “marginalised” groups at the expense of white heterosexual men. This is done regardless of qualifications, merit or other factors. Supporters believe such discriminatory practices are justified to counteract historical and ongoing oppression.\nThe Troubling Reality of Modern DEI\nWhile cloaked in noble values, the DEI movement in practice operates quite differently. Some major concerns include:\n– Open debate and discussion about DEI principles and policies is often suppressed. Questioning or critiquing them frequently leads to accusations of racism/sexism and punishment.\n– There is no consistency – special preferences are given to some groups deemed oppressed while others are left out. There is also no defined endpoint when DEI goals are achieved.\n– DEI breeds resentment as it judges and confers advantages based on immutable characteristics like race and sex. It often perpetuates victimhood mentalities rather than empowering marginalised groups.\n– Discrimination against the “privileged” does not promote social harmony or equal dignity. Two wrongs do not make a right.\n– Many marginalised groups oppose being used as pawns in the DEI agenda. Supporting equal treatment is not the same as supporting special treatment.\n– Billions are spent on DEI programmes and administrators while the benefits are questionable. It has become a lucrative industry built on sowing social division.\nThe Spread of DEI Dogma\nDue in part to fear of backlash, corporations, universities and other institutions have broadly embraced DEI ideology. They devote massive resources to DEI training and personnel. Corporations assume failing to demonstrate sufficient DEI bona fides will brand them as bigoted. But bending to DEI dictates also backfires, as it inherently confirms they must address systemic discrimination.\nMeanwhile, DEI dogma has spread throughout academia. Youth are increasingly taught to view life through lenses of oppression and victimhood. This indoctrination separates people into “oppressor” and “oppressed” groups, fuelling resentment and straining social cohesion.\nRestoring True Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nThe solution begins with a return to the original, noble goals of diversity, equity and inclusion – appreciating our differences, upholding just standards, and welcoming all people to participate in society. To accomplish this, we must challenge the radical DEI agenda and make the following points:\n– Treat people as individuals, not representatives of groups. Judge on character and merit, not race/sex.\n– Promote equal standards and opportunities for all, not unequal ones.\n– Appreciate diversity, don’t weaponize it. Unite based on shared values and humanity.\n– Respect people’s dignity; don’t demean them as helpless victims needing special treatment.\n– Foster open discussion, not suppression of dissenting views.\nBy standing up for these principles and rejecting DEI extremism, we can recover the real meaning of diversity, equity and inclusion. This will require courage to speak truth in the face of intimidation, but it offers the only path to a society where all people are truly judged by the content of their character.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-war-in-ukraine-was-provoked/content_1272.html": "The War in Ukraine Was Provoked\nWhy That Matters to Achieve Peace\nGeorge Orwell wrote in 1984 that “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” Governments work relentlessly to distort public perceptions of the past. Regarding the Ukraine War, the Biden administration has repeatedly and falsely claimed that the Ukraine War started with an unprovoked attack by Russia on Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In fact, the war was provoked by the US in ways that leading US diplomats anticipated for decades in the lead-up to the war, meaning that the war could have been avoided and should now be stopped through negotiations.\nRecognising that the war was provoked helps us to understand how to stop it. It doesn’t justify Russia’s invasion. A far better approach for Russia might have been to step up diplomacy with Europe and with the non-Western world to explain and oppose US militarism and unilateralism. In fact, the relentless US push to expand NATO is widely opposed throughout the world, so Russian diplomacy rather than war would likely have been effective.\nThe Biden team uses the word “unprovoked” incessantly, most recently in Biden’s major speech on the first-year anniversary of the war, in a recent NATO statement, and in the most recent G7 statement. Mainstream media friendly to Biden simply parrot the White House. The New York Times is the lead culprit, describing the invasion as “unprovoked” no fewer than 26 times, in five editorials, 14 opinion columns by NYT writers, and seven guest op-eds!\nThere were in fact two main US provocations. The first was the US intention to expand NATO to Ukraine and Georgia in order to surround Russia in the Black Sea region by NATO countries (Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Georgia, in anticlockwise order). The second was the US role in installing a Russophobic regime in Ukraine by the violent overthrow of Ukraine’s pro-Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych, in February 2014. The shooting war in Ukraine began with Yanukovych’s overthrow nine years ago, not in February 2022 as the US government, NATO, and the G7 leaders would have us believe.\nThe key to peace in Ukraine is through negotiations based on Ukraine’s neutrality and NATO non-enlargement.\nBiden and his foreign policy team refuse to discuss these roots of the war. To recognise them would undermine the administration in three ways. First, it would expose the fact that the war could have been avoided, or stopped early, sparing Ukraine its current devastation and the US more than $100 billion in outlays to date. Second, it would expose President Biden’s personal role in the war as a participant in the overthrow of Yanukovych, and before that as a staunch backer of the military-industrial complex and very early advocate of NATO enlargement. Third, it would push Biden to the negotiating table, undermining the administration’s continued push for NATO expansion.\nThe archives show irrefutably that the US and German governments repeatedly promised to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not move “one inch eastward” when the Soviet Union disbanded the Warsaw Pact military alliance. Nonetheless, US planning for NATO expansion began early in the 1990s, well before Vladimir Putin was Russia’s president. In 1997, national security expert Zbigniew Brzezinski spelled out the NATO expansion timeline with remarkable precision.\nUS diplomats and Ukraine’s own leaders knew well that NATO enlargement could lead to war. The great US scholar-statesman George Kennan called NATO enlargement a “fateful error,” writing in the New York Times that, “Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.”\nPresident Bill Clinton’s Secretary of Defense William Perry considered resigning in protest against NATO enlargement. In reminiscing about this crucial moment in the mid-1990s, Perry said the following in 2016: “Our first action that really set us off in a bad direction was when NATO started to expand, bringing in eastern European nations, some of them bordering Russia. At that time, we were working closely with Russia and they were beginning to get used to the idea that NATO could be a friend rather than an enemy … but they were very uncomfortable about having NATO right up on their border and they made a strong appeal for us not to go ahead with that.”\nIn 2008, then US Ambassador to Russia, and now CIA Director, William Burns, sent a cable to Washington warning at length of grave risks of NATO enlargement: “Ukraine and Georgia’s NATO aspirations not only touch a raw nerve in Russia, they engender serious concerns about the consequences for stability in the region. Not only does Russia perceive encirclement, and efforts to undermine Russia’s influence in the region, but it also fears unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences which would seriously affect Russian security interests. Experts tell us that Russia is particularly worried that the strong divisions in Ukraine over NATO membership, with much of the ethnic-Russian community against membership, could lead to a major split, involving violence or at worst, civil war. In that eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to intervene; a decision Russia does not want to have to face.”\nUkraine’s leaders knew clearly that pressing for NATO enlargement to Ukraine would mean war. Former Zelensky advisor Oleksiy Arestovych declared in a 2019 interview “that our price for joining NATO is a big war with Russia.”\nDuring 2010-2013, Yanukovych pushed neutrality, in line with Ukrainian public opinion. The US worked covertly to overthrow Yanukovych, as captured vividly in the tape of then US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt planning the post-Yanukovych government weeks before the violent overthrow of Yanukovych. Nuland makes clear on the call that she was coordinating closely with then Vice President Biden and his national security advisor Jake Sullivan, the same Biden-Nuland-Sullivan team now at the centre of US policy vis-à-vis Ukraine.\nAfter Yanukovych’s overthrow, the war broke out in the Donbas, while Russia claimed Crimea. The new Ukrainian government appealed for NATO membership, and the US armed and helped restructure the Ukrainian army to make it interoperable with NATO. In 2021, NATO and the Biden Administration strongly recommitted to Ukraine’s future in NATO.\nIn the immediate lead-up to Russia’s invasion, NATO enlargement was centre stage. Putin’s draft US-Russia Treaty (17 December 2021) called for a halt to NATO enlargement. Russia’s leaders put NATO enlargement as the cause of war in Russia’s National Security Council meeting on 21 February 2022. In his address to the nation that day, Putin declared NATO enlargement to be a central reason for the invasion.\nHistorian Geoffrey Roberts recently wrote: “Could war have been prevented by a Russian-Western deal that halted NATO expansion and neutralised Ukraine in return for solid guarantees of Ukrainian independence and sovereignty? Quite possibly.” In March 2022, Russia and Ukraine reported progress towards a quick negotiated end to the war based on Ukraine’s neutrality. According to Naftali Bennett, former Prime Minister of Israel, who was a mediator, an agreement was close to being reached before the US, UK, and France blocked it.\nWhile the Biden administration declares Russia’s invasion to be unprovoked, Russia pursued diplomatic options in 2021 to avoid war, while Biden rejected diplomacy, insisting that Russia had no say whatsoever on the question of NATO enlargement. And Russia pushed diplomacy in March 2022, while the Biden team again blocked a diplomatic end to the war.\nBy recognising that the question of NATO enlargement is at the centre of this war, we understand why US weaponry will not end this war. Russia will escalate as necessary to prevent NATO enlargement to Ukraine. The key to peace in Ukraine is through negotiations based on Ukraine’s neutrality and NATO non-enlargement. The Biden administration’s insistence on NATO enlargement to Ukraine has made Ukraine a victim of misconceived and unachievable US military aspirations. It’s time for the provocations to stop, and for negotiations to restore peace to Ukraine.",

Official figures reveal a 0.1% growth, albeit modest, driven by production and manufacturing sectors, particularly in the car industry.\nConstruction Dampened by Wet Weather\nWhile the economy showed signs of life, construction faced challenges due to persistent rain. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) highlighted this dampening effect on the construction sector.\nTurning the Corner: Chancellor’s Optimism\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt hailed the new figures as a “welcome sign that the economy is turning a corner.” He emphasized the need to adhere to the existing plan to sustain progress.\nFive Key Pledges and Political Debates\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak’s commitment to growing the economy was one of five key pledges made last year. However, Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves countered, asserting that “Britain is worse off with low growth and high taxes,” placing blame on the Conservative party.\nWhy GDP Matters\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is a crucial metric. A rising GDP typically indicates increased consumer spending, job creation, higher tax revenues, and improved wages for workers. Economists, politicians, and businesses closely monitor this indicator.\nRevised Estimates and Sector Insights\n- January Revision: The ONS revised January’s GDP growth from 0.2% to 0.3%.\n- February Highlights:\n- Production Industry: Output surged by 1.1% in February, contrasting with January’s 0.3% decline.\n- Construction: Persistent rain led to a 1.9% fall in construction output.\n- Services Sector: Slight growth, driven by public transport and haulage, along with hairdressing and hospitality.\nRecession’s End?\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, sees February’s figures as a strong signal that the recession may already be over. Factors like National Insurance cuts and slowing price rises contribute to renewed confidence in spending. However, uncertainties around a general election could impact business investment.\nGlobal Context and Opportunities\nAndrew Watson, CFO of Goodfellow (a Cambridge-based metal manufacturer), reflects on a peculiar situation. Despite anaemic UK growth since the pandemic, opportunities beckon. The United States, too, presents growth prospects. Energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions persist globally, affecting costs and economies.\nStruggling Sectors\nDr. Roger Barker, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, cautions against premature celebration. Some service industries, including hotels and hospitality, continue to grapple with challenges. The impact of previous interest rate hikes by the Bank of England remains a factor to watch.\nIn summary, while the UK economy inches forward, uncertainties persist. Whether this growth trajectory sustains or falters depends on a delicate balance of economic forces and global dynamics.",

And certainly, this sentiment is true with technology.\nWho doesn’t want faster, bigger (or smaller), more efficient? Take wireless mobile telecommunications. Our current broadband cellular network platform, 4G (or fourth generation), allows us to transmit data faster than 3G and everything that preceded. We can access information faster now than ever before in history. What more could we want? Oh, yes, transmission speeds powerful enough to accommodate the (rather horrifying) so-called Internet of Things. Which brings us to 5G.\nUntil now, mobile broadband networks have been designed to meet the needs of people. But 5G has been created with machines’ needs in mind, offering low-latency, high-efficiency data transfer. It achieves this by breaking data down into smaller packages, allowing for faster transmission times. Whereas 4G has a fifty-millisecond delay, 5G data transfer will offer a mere one-millisecond delay–we humans won’t notice the difference, but it will permit machines to achieve near-seamless communication. Which in itself may open a whole Pandora’s box of trouble for us – and our planet.\nMore bandwidth – more dangers of 5G\nLet’s start with some basic background on 5G technology. Faster processing speeds require more bandwidth, yet our current frequency bandwidths are quickly becoming saturated. The idea behind 5G is to use untapped bandwidth of the extremely high-frequency millimeter wave (MMW), between 30GHz and 300GHz, in addition to some lower and mid-range frequencies.\nHigh-frequency MMWs travel a short distance. Furthermore, they don’t travel well through buildings and tend to be absorbed by rain and plants, leading to signal interference. Thus, the necessary infrastructure would require many smaller, barely noticeable cell towers situated closer together, with more input and output ports than there are on the much larger, easier to see 4G towers. This would likely result in wireless antennas every few feet, on every lamp post and utility pole in your neighbourhood.\nHere are some numbers to put things into perspective: as of 2015, there were 308,000 wireless antennas on cell towers and buildings. That’s double the 2002 number. Yet 5G would require exponentially more, smaller ones, placed much closer together, with each emitting bursts of radiofrequency radiation (RFR)–granted, at levels much lower than that of today’s 4G cell towers–that will be much harder to avoid because these towers will be ubiquitous. If we could see the RFR, it would look like a smog that’s everywhere, all the time.\nSerious health concerns\nFirst, it’s important to know that in 2011, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified RFR as a potential 2B carcinogen and specified that the use of mobile phones could lead to specific forms of brain tumors.\nMany studies have associated low-level RFR exposure with a litany of health effects, including:\nDNA single and double-strand breaks (which leads to cancer)\noxidative damage (which leads to tissue deterioration and premature ageing)\ndisruption of cell metabolism\nincreased blood-brain barrier permeability\nmelatonin reduction (leading to insomnia and increasing cancer risks)\ndisruption of brain glucose metabolism\ngeneration of stress proteins (leading to myriad diseases)\nAs mentioned, the new 5G technology utilizes higher-frequency MMW bands, which give off the same dose of radiation as airport scanners. The effects of this radiation on public health have yet to undergo the rigours of long-term testing. Adoption of 5G will mean more signals carrying more energy through the high-frequency spectrum, with more transmitters located closer to people’s homes and workplaces–basically a lot more (and more potent) RFR flying around us. It’s no wonder that apprehension exists over potential risks, to both human and environmental health.\nPerhaps the strongest concern involves adverse effects of MMWs on human skin. This letter to the Federal Communications Commission, from Dr Yael Stein of Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, outlines the main points. Over ninety percent of microwave radiation is absorbed by the epidermis and dermis layers, so human skin basically acts as an absorbing sponge for microwave radiation. Disquieting as this may sound, it’s generally considered acceptable so long as the violating wavelengths are greater than the skin layer’s dimensions. But MMW’s violate this condition.\nFurthermore, the sweat ducts in the skin’s upper layer act like helical antennas, which are specialized antennas constructed specifically to respond to electromagnetic fields. With millions of sweat ducts, and 5G’s increased RFR needs, it stands to reason that our bodies will become far more conductive to this radiation. The full ramifications of this fact are presently unclear, especially for more vulnerable members of the public (e.g., babies, pregnant women, the elderly), but this technology\nFurthermore, MMWs may cause our pain receptors to flare up in recognition of the waves as damaging stimuli. Consider that the US Department of Defense already uses a crowd-dispersal method called the Active Denial System, in which MMWs are directed at crowds to make their skin feel like it’s burning, and also has the ability to basically microwave populations to death from afar with this technology if they choose to do so. And the telecommunications industry wants to fill our atmosphere with MMWs?\nThe researchers noted that the increased risk to the rats was relatively small; but if these findings translate to humans, the widespread increase in cellphone use could have a significant impact on populations.\nOther distressing research\nUnfortunately, innocent animals have already been the victims of testing to see MMW’s effects on living cells. Extrapolating the results from animal testing to humans isn’t straightforward, but the results nonetheless raise some serious red flags. Perhaps most significantly, a US National Toxicology Program study noted that male rats exposed to RFR for nine hours a day over two years developed rare forms of tumours in the brain and heart, and rats of both sexes developed DNA damage.\nThe researchers noted that the increased risk to the rats was relatively small; but if these findings translate to humans, the widespread increase in cellphone use could have a significant impact on populations. Thus the NTP study served to renew the debate about the potential harmful effects of cellphones on human health. Not only that, it caused a significant shift in the American Cancer Society’s understanding of radiation and cancer, and sparked them to state that our ignorance of RFR’s impact on human health could be compared to our previous obliviousness to the connection between smoking and lung cancer.\nOther animal research worldwide illustrates how microwave radiation in general and MMW’s in particular can damage the eyes and immune system, cell growth rate, even bacterial resistance. An experiment at the Medical Research Institute of Kanazawa Medical University showed that 60GHz millimeter-wave antennas produce thermal injuries in rabbit eyes, with thermal effects reaching below the eye’s surface. This study, meanwhile, suggests low-level MMW’s caused lens opacity–a precursor to cataracts–in rats’ eyes. A Chinese study demonstrated that eight hours’ of microwave radiation damaged rabbits’ lens epithelial cells. A Pakistani study concluded that exposure to mobile phone EMF prevented chicken embryo retinal cells from properly differentiating.\nThis Russian study revealed that exposing healthy mice to low-intensity, extremely high-frequency electromagnetic radiation severely compromised their immune systems. And a 2016 Armenian study concluded that low-intensity MMW’s not only depressed the growth of E. coli and other bacteria, but also changed certain properties and activity levels of the cells. The same Armenian study noted that MMW interaction with bacteria could lead to antibiotic resistance–distressing news, considering immunity to bacteria is already compromised due to the overuse of antibiotics.\nAgain, if these findings translate to humans, our rampant cellphone use would likely cause profound, adverse health effects; an increase in MMW’s as more bandwidth is introduced could further complicate the matter. But what’s also important to note here is that 5G technologies will not only have a profound impact on human health, but on the health of all living organisms it touches, including plants, as we shall see.\n5G harms the planet, too\nEqually disturbing, 5G technology puts environmental health at risk in a number of ways. First, MMWs may pose a serious threat to plant health. This 2010 study showed that the leaves of aspen seedlings exposed to RFR exhibited symptoms of necrosis, while another Armenian study suggested low-intensity MMW’s cause “peroxidase isoenzyme spectrum changes”–basically a stress response that damages cells–in wheat shoots. Plant irradiation is bad news for the planet’s flora, but it’s bad news for us, too: it could contaminate our food supply.\nSecond, the 5G infrastructure would pose a threat to our planet’s atmosphere. Network implementation will require the deployment of many, short-lifespan satellites via suborbital rockets propelled by hydrocarbon rocket engines. According to this 2010 California study, launching too many of these babies will vomit enough black carbon into the atmosphere to pollute global atmospheric conditions, affecting distribution of ozone and temperature. Worse, solid-state rocket exhaust contains chlorine, an ozone-destroying chemical. How can any government seriously concerned about climate change allow for this?\nThird, 5G will potentially threaten natural ecosystems. According to several reports over the last two decades–some of which are summarized here–low-level, non-ionizing microwave radiation affects bird and bee health. It drives birds from their nests and causes plume deterioration, locomotion problems, reduced survivorship and death. And bee populations suffer from reduced egg-laying abilities of queen bees and smaller colony sizes. More evidence of ecosystem disruption comes from this 2012 meta-study, which indicates that 593 of 919 research studies suggest that RFR adversely affects plants, animals and humans.\nIt bears repeating: 5G is bad news for all living creatures and the planet we share.\nBeware the propaganda deluge\nDespite being fully aware of all these unsettling results, threats and concerns, the US corporatocracy continues to maintain a gung-ho attitude about 5G. The Mobile Now Act was passed in 2016, and many US states have since gone ahead with 5G plans. The telecom industry’s biggest players have basically co-opted government powers to enforce their 5G agenda, with companies like AT&T and Qualcomm having begun live testing. And despite research showing serious threats to humans and the planet, the FCC Chairman announced intentions to open low-, mid- and high-frequency spectrums, without even mentioning a single word about the dangers.\nThey’re going to sell this to us as ‘faster browsing speeds’ – but the truth is, you’ll barely even notice the difference. They’re going to call anyone who protests against 5G a ‘Luddite’ or ‘technophobe’. But why such a willingness to embrace another new technology – even though it carries serious risks and brings spurious benefits? Why not heed the lessons learned from killer products like asbestos, tobacco and leaded gasoline?\nBecause a tiny percentage of people will gain an awful lot of money, is one reason. And because companies and governments will be given unprecedented amounts of power over civilians is the other.\nAll isn’t doom and gloom, though. At least one US politician is maintaining some level-headedness: in October, California Governor Jerry Brown stopped legislation that would have allowed the telecom industry to inundate the state with mini-towers. Brown’s bold actions have permitted localities a say in where and how many cell towers are placed.\nThe state of Hawaii has stopped 5G and smart meters by collectively threatening to charge every person who installed such meters with liability for any health problems residents may suffer. Moreover, 180 scientists have started a petition to warn of 5G potential health effects. Maybe these actions will afford more time for additional studies and data collection. Just as importantly, maybe they’ll cause other politicians and figureheads to reflect on what they’ve been pushing for.\nTake action\nIn the meantime, we as individuals must do everything we can to protect ourselves. Here’s what you can do:\nUnderstand EMFs and their behaviours\nProtect yourself with an EMF Shield to mark and protect you from hotspots. Try a patented product that neutralizes the harmful effects of mobile phones and other EMF emitting devices on humans.\nWhenever possible, limit your exposure: use an anti-radiation headset or speaker mode while talking on a cellphone.\nRefuse to use 5G phones and devices. Full stop. And discourage those you know from doing so.\nRefuse to buy anything ‘smart’ – ‘smart’ appliances, ‘smart’ heaters, etc.\nCarry shungite crystals to protect from radiation\nNo matter what, do NOT get a smart meter – these put high levels of 5G radiation right in your home\nJoin the growing numbers of dissenters. Get active with them here.\nDo as the Hawaiians have done and threaten smart meter and 5G tech installers with liability. You can learn how to do that here.\nSpread the word! Please share this article with everyone you know\nEven if the policy drivers and governments aren’t doing their due diligence, at least we can say we’re doing ours.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_european-farmers-revolt-against-eu-green-policies/content_165.html": "European Farmers Revolt Against EU Green Policies\nA rebellion is brewing across the farms and fields of Europe. After years of tightening environmental regulations and the growing costs of meeting net zero demands, farmers are pushing back.\nOnce reliable defenders of the European project and integration, the bloc’s farmers are now manning barricades and chokepoints. Their blockades of ports, highways and facilities have captured headlines for their economic impact. But they signal deeper rumblings of discontent from pillar industries.\nRising Tide of Discontent\nThe extent of protests encompasses most of Western Europe. Farmers from as far north as Denmark down to Greece and Portugal in the south have taken action. France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland and Ireland have seen some of the largest and most sustained demonstrations.\nTruckers and taxi operators have also joined in many areas, recognizing shared grievances with producers. Blockades have halted transport from major cities like Berlin, Warsaw, Paris and Amsterdam for days at a time. The disruption has emptied market shelves of fresh produce in many regions.\nWhat the protests make clear is that important constituencies of Europe’s working class now perceive existential threats to their livelihoods. Agricultural producers span both small family farms passed down generations and larger corporate producers. It is extraordinary to see such a breadth of operators with divergent backgrounds taking unified action.\nWhile the protests tap into longer-term frustrations among farmers, the spark is clear – the EU’s sweeping Green Deal and associated policies. Implemented with headlong haste since their launch in 2019, these regulations aimed at economy-wide decarbonization are now facing fierce blowback.\nInflexibility from Brussels Spurs Anger\nThe specific complaint of protesting farmers rests upon the mounting regulations and red tape they face under the Green Deal’s auspices. In their reckoning, layer upon layer of new environmental rules have ratcheted up their capital and operating expenses enormously.\nContradictory or opaque guidelines from multiple agencies have added further confusion. Farmers in areas like livestock, dairy and crop production cite figures showing input cost inflation markedly above the wider economy. In tandem with soaring energy bills on the farm, profitability sinks.\nMaking matters worse in farmers’ eyes is the unwillingness of EU policymakers to heed their situation. Introducing further bans on fertilizer and chemical inputs demonstrates an apparent indifference in Brussels to worsening rural hardship.\nWhen leaders dismiss farmer concerns as fringe “far right” views or suggest doubling down on 2040 net zero targets, patience wears thin. Trust in institutions slips further. The possibility of compromise solutions or temporary exemptions is cast as unacceptable backsliding.\nUneven Standards Foster Grievances\nAn associated grievance revolves around the uneven playing field European farmers now face. As their costs of regulatory, environmental and input compliance balloon, EU markets turn to imports to fill gaps. But imported agricultural goods can avoid the bloc’s stringent production standards.\nCheap Ukrainian grain, Argentinian soy or Brazilian beef offer prime examples. Lax enforcement mechanisms allow such imports to undercut EU farm goods on price, tempting large customers. But controlled studies have traced high chemical residues or antibiotic loads in these products, illegally high by EU benchmarks.\nTo EU producers, the outcome looks like the worst of both worlds. They bear escalating compliance burdens while losing market share to those untouched by these rules. Calling out this imbalance as unjust rings hollow to policymakers happy with “outsourcing” emissions. But understandable bitterness takes hold on Europe’s farms.\nBitter Harvest for Greens Looms\nThe political fallout across Europe appears poised to grow as long as Brussels refuses engagement on farm policy. The Green coalition that now partially governs Germany and other EU states championed the sprint to carbon neutrality. But their political capital frays with each passing protest.\nIncumbent Greens and leftist parties now brace for voter backlash as cost-ofrepressed realities boil over. Recent German elections saw rural regions swing decisively towards the right, punishing GreensSeen benefitting urban professionals. Regional French elections produced stark warning signs of this nature too.\nThe great irony lies in eroding support for climate-focused parties just as climate action hits its political apex. Polling suggests Eurosceptics, conservatives and “radical right” factions could gain their largest bloc of seats ever after 2024 European Parliament elections.\nSuch a coalition, polling from 9 key states indicates, may wield the clout to dilute or obstruct pillars of existing EU environmental plans. Governance paralysis could take hold, undermining climate and social legislation so arduously built over years.\nAn Inability to Adapt Carries Risks\nWhat most concerns centrist and Green party strategists is the collapse of long-reliable tactics. Appeals to reason and technocratic logic ring empty for those whose living standards sink. Depicting dissenters as “far right” extremists willing to trade future stability for present greed convinces fewer.\nThe establishment has yet to show an ability to adapt messaging and policy for this new reality. Doubling down on 2040 carbon neutrality amid swirling protests demonstrates this gap. However vital such goals may be, material conditions on the ground reveal unforced errors.\nCaught flat-footed without villains to target, the EU Green lobby insists no responsibility lies with them. But farmers directly attribute their economic plight to Brussels overreach. A failure of empathy and course correction on this scale poses real turbulence ahead inside Europe’s ambitious climate campaign.\nBridging divides to balance sustainability and prosperity presents complex challenges with no easy fixes. But the requisite first step remains active listening and willingness to modify flawed incentives. Only this foundation offers hopes of rebuilding bonds between EU capitals and their countryside constituencies.\nKey Takeaways\n• Widespread farmer protests over EU environmental rules and net zero costs now span most Western European countries. Discontent threatens to undermine public support for climate policies.\n• Farmers cite escalating operational expenses from regulations, energy bills, and input costs like fertilizer that squeeze profits. Inflexibility from Brussels exacerbates grievances.\n• Uneven import standards allow cheaper foreign foods to undercut domestic producers who bear heavy compliance burdens. This distortion fuels resentment.\n• Polling shows major gains likely for conservative and Eurosceptic parties in 2024 opposed to aspects of the EU Green Deal and climate agenda.\n• Inability of Green parties to adapt messaging or policies risks serious setbacks. Doubled down emissions targets amid spreading protests showcase tone deafness.\n• Alienation of working classes over rising costs of decarbonization imperils economic and political stability. Bridging rural-urban divides critical for EU climate policy viability.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-start-of-the-vehicle-zero-emission-quota/content_472.html": "The Start of the Vehicle Zero Emission Quota\nOn 1st January this year, the final assault on private motorists began with the introduction of the zero emission vehicle mandate target. From the start of 2023, manufacturers must sell a certain percentage of electric vehicles. The figure for this year is 22%. This means car makers have to ensure 22% of the new cars they sell are electric, leaving 78% to be internal combustion engine vehicles.\nIf manufacturers exceed that 78% target for petrol and diesel cars, they face fines of £15,000 for every car over the limit sold. Some media outlets portray this as an opportunity where manufacturers will slash electric car prices to boost sales. However, I believe the opposite will happen. As fewer petrol and diesel cars can be sold, their prices will increase, especially towards the end of the year as quotas near their limits. Manufacturers will likely exploit desperate buyers wanting conventional cars that are becoming scarce.\nThe Start of a Ban on Petrol and Diesel Cars\nThis is just the beginning. The target rises to 28% next year, 33% in 2026, 38% in 2027, 52% in 2028, 66% in 2029 and 80% in 2030 where it remains for five more years. Finally in 2035, it reaches 100% meaning a complete ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.\nDespite claims these targets will make electric cars affordable for the average motorist, I believe for many people across the UK they will remain impractical both financially and logistically. Where exactly are people living in flats and terraced houses with no off-street parking supposed to charge electric cars overnight? What about those in remote areas where charges are sparse or people working late unable to top up their car’s battery for an early start the next day?\nAn Excuse to Ban Most Private Cars\nIn my opinion, this push for electric cars is not really about emissions or the climate at all. It is about forcing most everyday motorists off the roads and making private transport unviable for ordinary people. It mirrors the expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone in London last August which priced many poorer motorists off the roads while the wealthy could still drive their latest luxury SUVs unaffected.\nIf the mayor’s policies were truly about reducing emissions, they would have targeted gradual percentage drops across all vehicles over the next decade. For example, mandating that vehicles emitting over 250g/km be banned by 2025, reducing to 200g/km by 2030 and so on. Most cars would be replaced through natural ownership cycles and it would impact all motorists fairly based on emissions rather than ability to pay.\nThe Way Things Are Going\nInstead, the current approach means those who can afford endless new cars are free to pollute as much as they want while anyone unable to keep buying the latest expensive electric model will soon find themselves forced off the road. The way things are progressing, for many people the only options will be taking the bus or forgoing travel beyond walking range if you cannot pay the exorbitant costs private motoring will entail over the coming years.\nIn Summary\n– The UK has introduced a Zero Emission Vehicle mandate that requires a rising percentage of electric car sales each year, reaching 100% in 2035. This effectively bans new petrol and diesel cars.\n– I believe instead of making electric cars affordable to average motorists as claimed, combustion engine vehicles will become more expensive as they are restricted.\n– For many people, electric vehicles remain impractical and unviable due to financial constraints, lack of local charging facilities, limited range, and other logistical issues.\n– These policies appear less about genuinely reducing emissions and more about forcing everyday private car drivers off the road.\n– A fairer approach would have been gradual percentage emissions reductions targets applied evenly across all vehicles over 5-10 years.\n– As things stand, the wealthy can continue polluting as much as they want while ordinary motorists will soon find private car ownership unaffordable.\n– This amounts to another attack on individual transport freedom and mobility rights.\nThese electric car targets and bans are yet another attack on personal freedom of movement.

His credentials as a election winner were also a factor, according to government sources, and he is expected to play a prominent role in the Tories’ campaign next year.\nThe reshuffle – wider than expected – saw Suella Braverman sacked as home secretary, days after she had alleged police bias in an unauthorised article about pro-Palestinian marches.\nVictoria Atkins was appointed Health Secretary, James Cleverly was made Home Secretary and Steve Barclay was moved to become Environment Secretary.\nSacking of Braverman Turns Right against Sunak\nThe sacking of Mrs Braverman led MPs on the Right of the party to turn on the Prime Minister. Dame Andrea Jenkyns, a prominent Boris Johnson supporter, sent a letter of no confidence to the 1922 committee – the formal process for removing a Tory leader.\nShe accused Mr Sunak of deciding to “purge the centre-Right from his Cabinet” and said Mrs Braverman was the only person in the Cabinet with the courage “to speak the truth of the appalling state of our streets and a two-tier policing system”.\nLord Frost said the reshuffle showed that the Prime Minister was taking the country “back to the past”, while Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former business secretary, said Mrs Braverman “seems to have been sacked for following Conservative policy and principles too loudly”.\nRenewed pressure for tax cuts also came from the Liz Truss-backed Growth Commission, which claimed Britain faces two decades of low growth under Mr Sunak’s economic approach.\nHuman Rights Ruling Could Stoke Tensions\nWednesday’s Supreme Court decision on the Government’s Rwanda migrant deportation scheme is also set to increase tensions, with Mrs Braverman expected to champion leaving the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR] from the back benches.\nThe former home secretary said she would have “more to say in due course” after she was sacked, with the dismissal delivered by phone call rather than in a face-to-face meeting.\nCameron Becomes First Ex-PM in Cabinet for 50 Years\nLord Cameron became the first former prime minister to return to a Cabinet role in more than 50 years, following in the footsteps of Alec Douglas-Home.\nOf his decision to return, he said: “I know it’s not usual for a prime minister to come back in this way, but I believe in public service. The Prime Minister asked me to do this job, and it’s a time where we have some daunting challenges as a country, the conflict in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine.”\nMr Sunak offered him the job in a face-to-face meeting in the No 11 flat last Tuesday evening – before Mrs Braverman’s controversial article was published in The Times.\nBut the reshuffle was brought forward by the row about her comments, according to Downing Street insiders, with the announcements previously having been planned for later in the year.\nCameron Gives Up Other Jobs to Focus on Role\nLord Cameron said he had given up all other jobs to accept the new role, declaring: “I now have one job as Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.”\nAfter acknowledging that he had disagreed with the Prime Minister in the past, including over HS2, he said he would be bound by collective responsibility, saying: “Politics is a team enterprise.”\nHe also dismissed controversy over his previous work lobbying for Greensill Capital, a financial services company, saying that was “in the past”.\nLord Cameron is expected to be paid more than £100,000 as he takes up the ministerial post. He has, however, given up the allowance given to former prime ministers and will not take the daily allowance peers can claim for attending the House of Lords.\nCleverly Moved to Make Way for Cameron\nMr Cleverly was made Home Secretary to create space for Lord Cameron. Mr Barclay was moved to become Environment Secretary, with Therese Coffey, a close ally of Liz Truss, sacked from that role.\nMs Atkins replaced Mr Barclay as Health Secretary, while Richard Holden, first elected in 2019, was elevated to the Cabinet by becoming chairman of the Conservative Party.\nAnother eye-catching move saw Esther McVey return to the front bench as a Cabinet Office minister with a brief that reportedly includes being tougher on “wokeness”.\nAppointment Angers Some on Tory Right\nThe appointment of Lord Cameron, seen as the architect of the Tory party’s modernisation drive that helped it back to power in 2010, combined with the sacking of Mrs Braverman, angered some on the Tory Right.\nMrs Braverman ran for the Tory leadership last summer from a platform on the Right and is widely tipped by Tory colleagues to make another bid for the leadership when it next becomes vacant.\nWriting for The Telegraph, Sir Jacob said: “Many Tories will view this reshuffle and feel that the Prime Minister does not want to deal with their concerns … perhaps after the populism of Boris Johnson there is now almost an anti-populism.”\nFrost Warns of Return to Cameron’s Past\nLord Frost, Mr Johnson’s Brexit negotiator who, like Lord Cameron, held a Cabinet role and sat in the House of Lords, was also critical, writing: “This reshuffle shows the Government has decided its direction of travel.\n“It’s back to the past: a world in which Brexit may have happened legally but not in the mindset of those who rule us; a world of social liberalism, of unambitious low-growth economics, and of deferral to the views and interests of the permanent class of people who run institutions like the BBC, the Office for Budget Responsibility, and the Metropolitan Police – just as it was under David Cameron once before, and now will be again.”\nHe said he was worried that “this will also be a return to a conservatism for the privileged – people who are already doing alright, people who don’t want the change so clearly signalled in those huge 2016 and 2019 victories”.\nNo 10 Dismisses Claims of Marginalising Right\nDowning Street dismissed suggestions that the reshuffle amounted to a marginalisation of the party’s Right, arguing that Mr Sunak had focused on delivering for the country when making his appointments.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_understanding-the-domestic-violence-disclosure-scheme/content_338.html": "Understanding the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme\nThe entitlement to be informed about your partner’s history of abuse or violence.\nClare’s Law, formally known as the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS), is a policy enforced by law enforcement agencies that empowers individuals to learn whether their present or former partner has a documented history of violent or abusive conduct.\nThis initiative bears the name of Clare Wood, a tragic victim who lost her life at the hands of her abusive ex-boyfriend in 2009. It was officially implemented in England and Wales in 2014, catalysed by a significant campaign led by Clare’s father, Michael Brown.\nUnder Clare’s Law, you have the privilege to:\n1. Lodge a formal request with the police for information pertaining to your current or former partner if you harbour concerns about their past abusive behaviour and believe they may pose a future threat to your safety.\n2. Seek information from the police about the current or former partner of a close friend, neighbour, or family member if you suspect that they could be at risk of domestic abuse in the future.\nThis is commonly referred to as the “right to inquire.” You possess this right, regardless of whether your inquiry pertains to a heterosexual or same-sex relationship, provided you are 16 years of age or older. Moreover, you maintain this right irrespective of your own or the gender identity, ethnicity, race, religion, or other characteristics of yourself, your neighbour, friend, or family member.\nAdditionally, you possess the “right to be informed.” This signifies that if police investigations reveal that your current or former partner has a documented history of violence or abuse, and there is a concern for your safety, the authorities may take the initiative to share this crucial information with you. If you harbour worries about past abusive or violent behaviour by your current or former partner, Clare’s Law was instituted to formally guarantee your right to acquire such knowledge.\nClare’s Law, officially recognized as the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS) in England, is a police-operated initiative that grants individuals, including members of the public, the formal right to request or receive typically confidential information concerning a romantic partner’s criminal history.\nThis can pertain to a current partner about whom you harbour concerns regarding past abusive behaviour or an ex-partner with whom you are no longer involved but believe may pose a threat to your safety.\nYou can submit a DVDS application if you perceive a personal risk of abuse or are concerned on behalf of a close friend or family member.\nClare’s Law encompasses two fundamental rights: the “right to ask” and the “right to know.”\n1. The “right to ask” allows you to make a DVDS application to inquire about a current or ex-partner whom you suspect has a history of abusive or violent conduct. Any information shared by the police regarding a partner is termed “disclosure.”\nYou can also make this request on behalf of a close friend or relative whom you believe may be at risk from their current or former partner. However, disclosure may not always be provided, depending on your relationship to the individual involved. The police may opt to disclose directly to your loved one or to someone better equipped to ensure their safety.\n2. The “right to know” signifies that if police investigations reveal a history of abusive behaviour by your current or ex-partner and a potential future risk, they may proactively share this information with you.\nClare’s Law stipulates that disclosures must adhere to the principles of being “lawful,” “proportionate,” and “necessary.” This means that the police must first determine whether it is appropriate to disclose your partner’s confidential records as part of your DVDS application. If there is sufficient evidence to suggest that you may be at risk, the police will collectively decide what information to disclose.\nIf you are applying for yourself, the police will typically provide disclosure directly to you, often in person. When applying on behalf of someone else, the disclosure may hinge on your relationship with that person and your ability to ensure their safety.\nIn cases where your partner is unknown to the police or there is no indication of a threat to your safety, the police will inform you accordingly. In such instances, they are not obliged to provide any disclosure to you or others.\nClare’s Law recognises various forms of domestic abuse, which extend beyond physical violence to include harassment, verbal abuse, stalking, psychological threats or manipulation, sexual assault, and violent behaviour. Domestic abuse can affect anyone regardless of age, race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, socioeconomic status, or disability.\nClare’s Law was established to prevent future domestic abuse, closing a legal loophole that allowed domestic abusers or individuals with prior records of violence or abuse to conceal their personal history. This lack of awareness put their partners at greater risk of future harm. The law is named after Clare Wood, who tragically lost her life due to this lack of information.\nAfter a dedicated campaign led by Clare’s father, Michael Brown, the law underwent transformation, evolving from a policy into an official statute. The Domestic Abuse Act 2021, receiving Royal Assent on April 29, 2021, marked a significant milestone by establishing Clare’s Law as a statutory right, removing it from police discretion. This Act also introduced the first government-defined statutory definition of “Domestic Abuse,” encompassing psychological and economic abuse in addition to physical violence.\nClare’s Law has expanded its reach to several countries worldwide since its inception in England and Wales in 2014. Scotland adopted its version in 2016, followed by Northern Ireland in 2018. Canada and Australia have also experimented with similar schemes based on the “right to ask” and “right to know” framework.\nIn Canada, as of March 2021, Ottawa, Ontario, introduced Clare’s Law, while the Royal Canadian Mounted Police started enforcing it in Saskatchewan and Alberta from April 2021. Newfoundland & Labrador implemented a version of Clare’s Law called the Interpersonal Violence Disclosure Protocol Act in November 2019.\nNew South Wales has introduced Clare’s Law, and it has undergone trials in South Australia. Additionally, Queensland and Victoria are deliberating the implementation of the Disclosure Scheme. Additional pages with general information would be valuable to provide a comprehensive understanding of Clare’s Law and its global impact.\nClare’s Law takes its name from Clare Wood, a 36-year-old woman residing in Yorkshire, tragically murdered by her ex-boyfriend, George Appleton, in 2009.\nTheir initial connection occurred on Facebook, where Clare was unaware of Appleton’s criminal history when they became acquainted. Their relationship spanned six months but took a coercive turn, prompting Clare to end it. Regrettably, Appleton refused to move on and subjected her to a relentless cycle of abusive conduct, including harassment, property damage, threats of violence, and attempted assault.\nDespite Clare’s courageous decision to file a police statement and obtain a restraining order, Appleton’s abusive behaviour persisted without intervention. Tragically, it culminated in the loss of Clare’s life, followed by Appleton taking his own life shortly thereafter. Subsequent investigations uncovered Appleton’s history of violence and abuse, particularly towards women, a fact known to the Greater Manchester Police but not disclosed to Clare.\nDuring this period, data protection laws created a legal loophole, enabling former abusers to keep their criminal records confidential. This gap in the law left potential targets like Clare without the means to inquire or seek information from the police about their partner’s history of abuse.\nIn the wake of Clare’s devastating death, her father, Michael Brown, embarked on a relentless campaign to challenge this legal deficiency. Michael firmly believed that Clare might have been spared if she had been aware of Appleton’s violent past. After five years of tireless advocacy, Michael succeeded in effecting a change in the law, allowing the police to both disclose and proactively inform individuals about their partners’ criminal records and relevant prior convictions. As a result, Clare’s Law was formally introduced in England and Wales in 2014 under the official designation of the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS).\nIn summary, Clare’s Law was created through the determined efforts of Michael Brown, Clare Wood’s father, who tirelessly campaigned for legislative changes to empower individuals with information about their partners’ criminal histories, in memory of his daughter Clare.\nWho Created Clare’s Law: Michael Brown, the Man and Father Behind Clare’s Law\nClare’s Law was established by Michael Brown in the aftermath of his daughter Clare’s tragic murder by her ex-boyfriend.\nThe inquiry into Clare’s untimely demise unearthed a disturbing fact: her ex-boyfriend possessed a history of violent conduct against women, information Clare was never privy to due to a loophole in the Data Protection Act.\nDriven by the conviction that knowledge could have saved Clare’s life, Michael embarked on a passionate campaign as an advocate for other families who had endured similar losses. His vision was to institute a police disclosure scheme affording everyone the right to access a partner’s history of violence.\nMichael’s tireless efforts paved the way for the implementation of Clare’s Law in the United Kingdom and overseas.\nIn 2014, he successfully championed the passage of Clare’s Law in England and Wales. Subsequently, it was extended to his birthplace, Scotland, in 2016, and Northern Ireland in 2018. Beyond UK borders, a version of Clare’s Law was also trialled in New South Wales, Australia, and the province of Saskatchewan, Canada.\nMichael’s remarkable campaign earned him a slew of accolades, including the British Citizen Award in January 2020 and an Everyday Heroes Award in his hometown of Aberdeen in February 2020. He was further appointed as the patron of The Endeavour Project, a support group in Bolton dedicated to aiding families affected by domestic abuse.\nAlthough Michael passed away in July 2020, his legacy endures. He posthumously received the 2020 She Inspires award in the ‘He For She’ category, honouring male advocates of gender equality. The She Inspires initiative also introduced the Michael Brown Agent Of Change award in his memory, recognizing those who, like him, have fought to rectify glaring injustices.\nMichael’s lasting impact has garnered widespread recognition from the media:\n– “His work has already saved hundreds of lives, and we believe his legacy will save thousands more.”\n– “After the best part of a decade, Clare’s Law will finally become enshrined into law as part of the Domestic Abuse Bill.”\nHere is a timeline of Michael’s campaign:\n**2009**\n– The inquest into Clare’s murder exposes a loophole in the Data Protection Act preventing the police from sharing information about individuals with a history of violence or abuse.\n– Michael collaborates with Manchester news reporter Michelle Livesey and contacts Hazel Blears, Labour MP for Salford.\n– A nationwide poll published in ‘Fabulous’ magazine reveals that 91% of people would like to know if their partner had a history of domestic abuse, with 77% indicating they would end a relationship if this information were disclosed by the police.\n– Michael launches the ‘Respect and Protect’ campaign (later renamed the ‘Clare’s Law Campaign’) with the parliamentary support of Hazel Blears and other MPs, including former Home Secretary Alan Johnson.\n**2010**\n– Michael and Hazel Blears meet with the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, who announces the launch of a Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme consultation.\n– Michael’s petition for Clare’s Law garners over 1,000 signatures, which he delivers to Downing Street alongside Michelle Livesey and Hazel Blears, attracting significant media attention.\n**2012-14**\n– The Home Office announces a Clare’s Law pilot scheme by police forces in Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire, and Gwent.\n– Clare’s Law is subsequently rolled out to all police forces in England and Wales.\n**2015-16**\n– Michael calls for a similar scheme to be introduced in his birthplace of Scotland, meeting with Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, at Holyrood.\n– A pilot of Clare’s Law is initiated in Ayrshire and Michael’s hometown of Aberdeen.\n– Clare’s Law is officially implemented in Scotland, known as the Disclosure Scheme for Domestic Abuse Scotland (DSDAS).\n**2016 Onwards**\n– Michael participates in numerous TV and radio interviews, including GMTV and The One Show, and delivers speeches at various women’s refuges.\n– Several documentaries, such as “The Crime that Shook Britain,” “Deadly Dates,” and “Swipe Right for Murder,” feature Clare’s story.\n– Teen magazines, local publications, and national news outlets all cover Clare’s story to raise awareness of the potential dangers of dating through social media.\n– Clare’s Law informs a storyline on the television show Coronation Street involving characters Geoff Metcalfe and Yasmeen Nazir.\nClare’s Law grants you the right to inquire about the background of your husband, boyfriend, or partner. Whether you are in a heterosexual or same-sex relationship, if you have concerns that your current or former partner has a history of violence, Clare’s Law entitles you to seek information.\nYou can submit an application to the police either for yourself or on behalf of someone else, such as a friend, relative, or neighbour, whom you believe is at risk. Anyone can apply, regardless of race, gender identity, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, religion, or any other characteristic.\nClare’s Law serves as a tool to prevent all forms of domestic abuse, not just physical violence. Domestic abuse can manifest in various ways, and there are numerous indicators or warning signs that a partner may have a history of abuse or could potentially become abusive in the future.\nThese indicators may include:\n– Inflicting physical, sexual, or psychological harm.\n– Isolating you from friends, family, or colleagues.\n– Exerting control over your phone, finances, or internet access.\n– Making explicit or implied threats against you.\n– Causing damage to your property or belongings.\n– Engaging in stalking or harassment, including making unwanted or malicious calls and sending nasty or abusive messages.\nIf any of these circumstances apply to you, or if your partner makes you feel unsafe for any other reason, you have the right to inquire about their background under Clare’s Law.\nThe process for making a Clare’s Law application depends on your place of residence:\n– Apply here if you live in England or Wales.\n– Apply here if you live in Scotland.\n– Apply here if you live in Northern Ireland.\n– If you reside elsewhere, search for “Clare’s Law” followed by your country’s name. Versions of the scheme currently exist in New South Wales (Australia) and Saskatchewan (Canada).\nIf you discover that your partner has a history of abuse, it’s essential to understand that Clare’s Law is designed to inform you about your partner’s past. If there is sufficient cause to believe that you may be at risk, the police will collectively decide what information to disclose to you. You can then decide on your next steps independently or with their assistance.\nIn cases of immediate danger, please dial 999 to contact the police. If it is too risky to speak, the operator will prompt you to make an audible sound like coughing to signal your need for police assistance. If you are unable to make any sound, the call will be directed to an automated system that instructs the caller to press 55 if they are in danger. If 55 is not received, the police will not be dispatched.\nWhat you must do\nIf you have met a new partner and you have any reason to question their past, do not hesitate, search for:\nDomestic violence disclosure scheme application and contact your nearest police authority.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_gas-bills-could-rise-by-1000-under-labour/content_31.html": "Gas bills could rise by £1,000 under Labour\nLabour are planning to move green levies to Gas which will add an average of £1,000 per year to the average home, which could significantly impact your household expenses.\nIf they were to take the baton from the previous Energy Secretary, Claire Coutinho, who received a report earlier this year proposing a controversial move: shifting green levies from electricity bills to gas bills or even into general taxation. This proposal has been put forward amidst concerns that the weight of green levies on household costs is stifling progress towards net zero emissions.\nAccording to an analysis by Cadent, a gas distribution company, gas bills could rise by a staggering £1,000 per year for millions of homes reliant on gas if all green tariffs are moved from electricity bills to gas bills.\nThe analysis further reveals that low-income families would bear the brunt of this move, with green levies accounting for nearly half (47 percent) of their energy bills if they rely on gas.\nExperts have warned that adding levies to gas bills would spread the costs among fewer households, potentially exacerbating fuel poverty. Furthermore, the report found that gas consumers would pay between £879 and £924 more in running costs than heat pump consumers by 2035, highlighting the potential inequality in energy costs.\nWith the recent snap general election called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the decision on these proposals will fall upon either his government or an incoming Labour administration after July 4th. Sunak’s approach towards net zero and energy bills has been described as more “pragmatic and proportionate” than his predecessors, having watered down several green objectives last year.\n“It is critical to make fair and equitable decisions to maintain public confidence in net zero. Research indicates that one of the options being considered on policy costs would not achieve that, disproportionately impacting some of the most vulnerable people in society.”\nThis is one of the options which could be considered by Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, if they win the election in July, along with many other levies that he has already indicated that he would support.\nHeat pumps are totally unsuitable for many British homes, and therefore, in order to swing the balance in favour of these hideous contraptions, one option would be to bump up the cost of gas disproportionately, in order to make heat-pumps appear to be better value, but ultimately, the reality is that those who can least afford to pay more, will be paying the most.\nIs this really the way forward?",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_we-need-to-stand-and-reclaim-democracy/content_648.html": "We need to stand and reclaim Democracy\n“We must unite to safeguard Democracy: Overcoming the Perils of Division and Exploiting Differences\nThe United Kingdom has long been a diverse nation, home to people of various backgrounds, races, religions, and creeds coexisting harmoniously under a common identity as Britons. However, we now face emerging threats that seek to sow division among us.\nIn a previous discussion on immigration, I stressed the importance of not misinterpreting my words. My intention is never to foster division, racism, or any form of discrimination. Those familiar with my property-related channel know my commitment to truth-telling in an industry rife with deceit. Regardless of your background, origin, race, or creed, I extend my hand to assist anyone in need. I hold disdain for the elitist corporations that cynically manipulate societal divisions for their own gains, thereby influencing our nation and the Western world.\nNot too long ago, I referred to “woke warriors” and faced a barrage of abuse in various forms, from messages to emails. This is because I refuse to tolerate virtue-signaling hypocrites who manufacture division where none exists. They exaggerate non-existent rifts to appear virtuous, often seeking validation at social gatherings. What we fail to realize is that this behavior is far more perilous than we might imagine, as it has led to civil unrest and even war in some nations.\nCyprus serves as a poignant example. Divisions were sown during British rule, artificially categorising people as “Turkish Cypriots” and “Greek Cypriots,” despite their shared racial heritage. Even before DNA testing, it was evident that Cyprus had the world’s highest incidence of thalassemia, with 51% of its population carrying this genetic trait. While mostly harmless, thalassemia major, which necessitates monthly blood transfusions, results when two carriers have children. DNA later confirmed that all Cypriots share a common gene pool, yet these divisions were exploited to the point of turning people against each other, dividing the island.\nI do not suggest that such a scenario will transpire in the UK, but we must remain vigilant against political forces that seek to create and exploit divisions, for this is a grave danger. So, what can we do? I previously announced my intention to run in the upcoming election for Northampton North. While the odds are stacked against independents, with none having won or even recouped their deposits, I am undeterred. My aim is not solely victory but to inspire others nationwide where independent candidates stand a chance.\nWe have been conditioned to believe that MPs must hail from elite backgrounds and partake in secretive rituals, but this is a fallacy. The best representatives emerge from real-life experiences—cab drivers, hairdressers, single parents—people from all walks of life. Regardless of your background, it is time to rise and make a difference. I do not propose that a legion of independents will govern, but we can secure enough seats to compel change and halt the exploitation and madness perpetuated by the arrogant and treacherous mainstream parties.\nDo not allow them to sow division. They hail from different sewers, but they all ultimately answer to party whips, not to you. How many of us wanted our MPs to support the Iraq invasion? Likely none, yet they voted for it. I will unveil a Wall of Shame, exposing their names. As an independent, your beliefs matter, and it is healthy for us to disagree; this is the essence of democracy. We must reclaim our nation and instate genuine democracy.\nIn summary:\n– The UK, home to diverse populations, faces emerging threats that seek to divide us.\n– My mission is to foster unity, not division or racism.\n– Corporations exploit societal divisions, a dangerous historical pattern.\n– Cyprus serves as a cautionary tale of exploited divisions leading to civil strife.\n– We must remain vigilant against political forces magnifying differences despite our commonalities.\n– My candidacy in the next election aims to inspire a movement of independent candidates.\n– True representatives come from diverse backgrounds, not just elite circles.\n– We need enough independents to influence change and counter mainstream party division.\n– Do not let them pit us against each other. We must reclaim our democracy.”",

The Labour leader’s plan, which aims to bolster funding for state education, could potentially fall foul of European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) law, raising serious questions about its viability.\nLord Pannick, one of Britain’s most eminent constitutional and human rights lawyers, has lent his support to legal advice suggesting that subjecting private schools to VAT would likely breach ECHR law. In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, Lord Pannick stated, “It would be strongly arguable that for a new government to impose VAT on independent schools would breach the right to education. That is because all other educational services will remain exempt from VAT and the charging of VAT on independent schools alone is designed to impede private education, and will have that effect.”\nThe distinguished KC and crossbench peer emphasised that the Labour policy risks contravening two articles in the ECHR that safeguard the right to education. This assessment is rooted in legal advice dating back to the early 1980s, when the country’s most senior legal minds cautioned that plans to eliminate tax exemptions for private schools or abolish the institutions altogether would likely violate international human rights law to which the United Kingdom is a signatory.\nThe contentious issue of taxing private schools is not a novel concept within the Labour Party. Previous leaders have floated similar ideas as part of broader plans to integrate these institutions into the state sector. Under the leadership of Michael Foot, the Labour manifesto of 1983 went so far as to pledge to “charge VAT on the fees paid to [private] schools”.\nHowever, the policy to abolish private schools was ultimately abandoned following interventions by senior lawyers. They argued that such a move could conflict with the ECHR and specifically highlighted the risk associated with imposing VAT on these institutions.\nWhile Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out the wholesale abolition of private schools, his current proposal seeks to compel these institutions to pay business rates and 20 per cent VAT on tuition fees. This approach, while less drastic than previous iterations, still raises significant legal concerns.\nAn unearthed legal opinion from 1987, jointly authored by the late Lord Lester and Lord Pannick, both prominent human rights lawyers, concluded that a government “could not lawfully prohibit fee-paying, independent education or remove the benefits of charitable status or impose VAT in respect of such education” while remaining a member of the ECHR. Lord Pannick has since confirmed that he believes this argument remains valid today.\nThe legal opinion was further bolstered by a foreword written in 1991 by Lord Scarman, who served as a Law Lord in the precursor to the Supreme Court. He suggested that the opinion would “encourage a challenge which could be mounted by taking the argument to the [ECHR]… if ever a government should seek to abolish or discriminate against [private schools]”.\nHistorical context suggests that previous Labour proposals to impose VAT on private schools under the leadership of Neil Kinnock and Michael Foot may have been abandoned following an earlier legal warning in 1982. Lord Lester, writing in The Times in 2019, recalled, “In 1982 [Lord] David Pannick and I advised the school governing bodies that Labour’s plan would violate the European Convention on Human Rights and its first protocol. Our opinion was published. No one disputed our advice and the policy was dropped.”\nInterestingly, the policy failed to appear in Labour’s subsequent manifesto for the June 1987 election under Neil Kinnock’s leadership. The legal opinion in question was issued in April of that same year. However, Lord Kinnock told The Telegraph that he did not recall any such proposals and was unaware of the legal opinion.\nIt is worth noting that this legal advice was issued prior to the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 by the New Labour government, which enshrined the rights contained in the ECHR into UK law. This legislative development adds another layer of complexity to the current debate.\nThe revelations surrounding the potential legal challenges to Labour’s private school tax policy raise questions about Sir Keir Starmer’s willingness to engage in a protracted legal battle over this controversial issue. This is particularly pertinent given that Labour had previously considered abolishing private schools altogether under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.\nSir Keir, who opinion polls suggest is poised to enter Downing Street with a substantial majority, has long been a staunch supporter of the ECHR. He has criticised Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for suggesting that the UK might withdraw from the court if it were to rule against the government’s Rwanda plan for asylum seekers.\nIn a speech delivered in December, Sir Keir emphasised the importance of the ECHR, describing it as an “achievement, not just of this nation, but of Winston Churchill and the Conservative Party that brought peace and protection to the world”. This stance appears to be at odds with the potential legal implications of his party’s education policy.\nLegal experts believe that Sir Keir’s headline education policy is likely to contravene two key articles in the ECHR. These are Article 2 of the First Protocol to the convention and Article 14, which protect the right to education and guard against attempts to remove or impede the right to access a broad range of schools.\nJeremy Hyam KC, a human rights lawyer, offered his perspective on the matter: “It is clearly arguable that if the state imposes VAT and removes [the] charitable status of private schools without proper analysis of the likely effects on the sustainability and economic viability of such schools, the effects may be so destructive of the ability of such schools to continue to exist that it is a disproportionate and unlawful interference with the right of plurality of educational choice protected under the ECHR.”\nLord Pannick’s involvement in this debate is particularly noteworthy given his track record in high-profile legal cases. The Government sought his expertise in drafting the bill to support its plan to deport channel migrants to Rwanda last year. However, reports suggest that he warned the chances of securing the flights would be severely limited.\nIn 2020, Lord Pannick represented Shamima Begum in the Supreme Court’s judicial review brought against then Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who had banned her from returning to the UK for legal proceedings regarding the removal of her British citizenship. The KC also successfully represented Gina Miller in her case against the Government over whether the Prime Minister first needed approval from Parliament before triggering the UK’s exit from the European Union.\nMore recently, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson called upon Lord Pannick at the height of the Partygate scandal in March 2023. The KC was asked to advise on Johnson’s assessment by the House of Commons Privileges Committee regarding whether he knowingly misled MPs.\nThe potential legal challenges to Labour’s private school tax policy have drawn criticism from the current government. Gillian Keegan, the Secretary of State for Education, said: “Labour have already admitted their ideologically motivated tax on education will arbitrarily lead to larger class sizes and now it has emerged they have been warned their policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights law. Make no mistake, taxing education is unprecedented in this country. No one who cares about our children’s education would ever put politics before pupils, but it is clear that for Labour no price is too high in their pursuit of the pernicious politics of envy.”\nIn response to these concerns, a Labour Party spokesman defended the policy: “We do not agree with this assessment, and we are confident that our plans are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Labour will invest in delivering a brilliant state education for children in every state school by recruiting over 6,500 new teachers, funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Independent schools have raised fees above inflation for well over a decade and do not have to pass Labour’s proposed change on to parents.”\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen how Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour Party will navigate the potential legal challenges to their private school tax policy. The outcome of this controversy could have far-reaching implications for the UK’s education system, the future of private schools, and the broader landscape of human rights law in the country.",

In this article, we’ll delve into the significance of Euro emission standards and explore the transition from Euro 1 to the upcoming Euro 7.\n**The Essence of Euro Emission Standards**\nThe roots of Euro emission standards can be traced back to 1992 when they were introduced as a means to curtail the level of exhaust emissions produced by both petrol and diesel vehicles. The primary objective was to mitigate the environmental impact of these emissions, safeguarding the air we breathe and diminishing our carbon footprint.\nThe certification process involves conducting thorough assessments prior to granting the vehicle “type approval.” This assessment ensures that the vehicle is not only ecologically compliant but also roadworthy, encompassing checks on essential components such as lights, wipers, and horns.\n**Euro 7: The Next Milestone**\nScheduled for implementation on July 1, 2025, Euro 7 is poised to be the most rigorous emission standard to date. Building on the foundation of its predecessor, Euro 6, this standard will apply the most stringent emission limits across all new petrol and diesel cars. The paramount criterion dictates that new cars sold from 2025 onward must emit no more than 60 milligrams of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to adhere to the standard.\nHowever, Euro 7 brings forth additional changes that will influence not only conventional vehicles but also electric and hybrid cars.\n**Embracing Change with Euro 7**\n1. **Enhanced Focus on Brakes and Tyres**: Euro 7 introduces emission limits for brakes and tyres, targeting the release of brake dust and tyre particulates. This move is a step towards minimizing pollutants from a wider array of sources within vehicles.\n2. **Evaluating Electric Vehicle Batteries**: Electric cars and plug-in hybrids will now undergo battery assessments to gauge their longevity over time and usage. This ensures the longevity of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, subsequently boosting the appeal of used EVs in the market.\n3. **Sustained Cleanliness for All Vehicles**: Not only electric cars but also traditional petrol and diesel vehicles will be subject to continuous monitoring for cleanliness. Parameters such as exhaust filters, general wear and tear, and engine performance will be scrutinized using electronic sensors. Notably, Euro 7 extends the assessment interval from every five years and 100,000 km to every ten years and 200,000 km from 2025.\n4. **Rigorous Pre-Production Testing**: Euro 7 ushers in more comprehensive testing methodologies that encompass a broader spectrum of conditions. Vehicles will now be evaluated for emissions during shorter journeys and higher temperatures, ensuring their performance is consistent across varying environments.\n**The Horizon for Euro 7 and Its Implications**\nAs with its predecessors, Euro 7 is expected to remain in effect for a span of five to ten years. While its introduction is unlikely to directly affect the UK’s low emission zones, owning a vehicle that aligns with Euro 7 standards can certainly prove advantageous, particularly with impending expansions like the London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ).\n**A Glimpse into Past Standards: Euro 1 to Euro 6**\n– **Euro 6**: Launched in September 2015, Euro 6 put significant emphasis on mitigating NOx emissions from diesel vehicles through the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction technology.\n– **Euro 5**: Introduced in January 2011, Euro 5 mandated the incorporation of particulate filters for new diesel vehicles, vital for urban areas like London’s ULEZ.\n– **Euro 4**: Rolled out in January 2005, Euro 4 was a pivotal standard for evading ULEZ charges in London and centered on enhancing overall emission quality.\n– **Euro 3**: Incepted in January 2001, Euro 3 targeted swift engine warm-up and reduced carbon monoxide and diesel particulate emissions.\n– **Euro 2**: Similar to Euro 3, Euro 2 aimed to minimize emissions; however, its effectiveness was somewhat diminished owing to its earlier introduction in January 1997.\n– **Euro 1**: The pioneer among Euro emission standards, Euro 1, emerged on December 31, 1992. This standard marked a milestone by making catalytic converters mandatory and ushering in the transition to unleaded petrol.\nIn the pursuit of cleaner mobility and ecological equilibrium, Euro emission standards stand as a testament to human ingenuity and commitment to shaping a sustainable future. With Euro 7 poised to raise the bar even higher, the automotive industry is taking significant strides towards a cleaner and greener tomorrow.\nConclusion\nThe degree of short-sightedness and outright indifference to the gravity of ULEZ is shocking, to say the least. We are expected to accept measures that claim to be about cleaner air, however, those in a position to pay, are free to pollute as much as they wish.\nIf this really were about cleaner air, which we all want, there would have been a ban on vehicles emitting more than 300g for example, which would reduce by 10% per year, which nobody would have objected to, because that would have been fair, it would have taken at least a decade to reduce to zero, cars would be replaced through natural wastage and manufacturers would also have time to supply cars with lower and lower emissions.\nIf all else failed, the last 2/3 years could have been extended slightly and we would have still got there by 2035. However, this is little more than a cynical exploitation of the poorest, who cannot afford to change their car for a Euro 4/6 as the case may be. There is also the fact that this is yet another step in social coercion, which has accelerated since the public accepted to be under house arrest during the lockdown.\nThe sad reality for those who are currently indifferent, because they do have compliant cars, is that this will invariably change from the 1st July 2025, when the Euro 7 standard is introduced, how many compliant vehicles will there be then?\nIn the meantime, we as one of the least polluting nations in the world, are being punished and exploited, in some vain effort by our leaders to join their ‘virtue signally hypocrites’ on the world stage, whilst China is building over 300 coal-fired power stations.\nA giant leap forward would have been, to impose duty on all goods arriving from China, no matter how small and introduce a climate tax, until they reduce their emissions, one small token decrease by China, would be more than the entire UK reaching ‘Net Zero’ but then I almost forgot, this is not about emissions is it? No, it is about social engineering a totalitarian society and we are sleepwalking straight in to it.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_independent-thinking-is-not-welcome-by-reform-uk/content_325.html": "Independent thinking is not welcome by Reform UK\n‘This is what happens when you mess with Nigel’: The bitter row tearing Reform apart\nA vicious feud between MP Rupert Lowe and ‘messianic’ Farage erupts into public view, bringing the party’s honeymoon period to a decisive end\nOnly five months prior, Rupert Lowe had been among Nigel Farage’s most enthusiastic supporters, frequently posting on social media platform X throughout the autumn with messages such as “Nigel is right”, “Nigel is bang on”, and “Well said @Nigel_Farage, well said indeed.” Farage himself had expressed tremendous satisfaction when Lowe became one of five Reform MPs elected to Parliament, declaring that he would be a “terrific colleague” who would undoubtedly “put the people first”.\nBy Friday, however, an extraordinary deterioration in relations between the two prominent Reform figures was laid bare for all to witness, when the party issued an incendiary public statement detailing allegations of misconduct against its own parliamentarian. Lowe, responding swiftly, accused Farage’s team of publicising “false” and “malicious” allegations against him, attributing this to a “complete inability to accept even the most mild constructive criticism” directed at the Reform leader. He concluded a pointed 570-word statement with a warning that spoke directly to the heart of criticisms being levelled at Farage amidst a growing schism within Reform that dramatically escalated into a public civil war on Friday evening. “This is our party as much as it is Nigel’s,” Lowe asserted forcefully.\nThe spark that ignited the conflagration\nThe immediate catalyst that appeared to have precipitated Reform’s unprecedented attack on Lowe was an interview published on Thursday in which the MP openly questioned Farage’s suitability as a future Prime Minister. Lowe stated candidly that it was “too early to know whether Nigel will deliver the goods” and characterised Reform as a “protest party led by the Messiah”. He further cautioned that Farage “can only deliver if he surrounds himself with the right people,” adding weight to growing concerns about the party’s structure and leadership.\nThose familiar with Farage’s leadership style immediately recognised that Lowe had crossed a significant boundary as far as their leader was concerned. “This is what happens when you mess with Nigel,” remarked one party source with evident resignation. “It was the same with Ukip, it was the same with the Brexit party. The theme continues. It’s ridiculous.”\nFarage’s initial response to Lowe’s provocative interview materialised in the form of a television appearance on Thursday in which he labelled Lowe “utterly, completely wrong” and conspicuously declined to confirm whether his colleague would remain a Reform MP at the next general election. His notable hesitation might be explained by Reform’s statements released just 24 hours later, which made a series of damaging allegations against Lowe and confirmed that the party whip had been withdrawn from him with immediate effect.\nA clash of personalities and visions\nParty insiders reveal that Farage would have been “absolutely livid” over Lowe’s public criticism. Yet the tensions between these two significant figures come as little surprise to those familiar with Reform’s internal operations and dynamics.\nThe increasingly bitter dispute is said to have originated from Lowe’s profound frustration with what he perceives as the party’s inability to transform itself sufficiently to capitalise on widespread public disillusionment with mainstream political parties and a steady increase in support for Reform that has resulted from this disaffection. He is particularly troubled by the absence of a comprehensive policy programme and what he considers to be inadequate organisational structures throughout the party.\nFor months, Reform has claimed to be quietly restructuring its operation under the leadership of Zia Yusuf, a multimillionaire tech entrepreneur, implementing rigorous new vetting procedures for candidates, establishing a formal party board, and organising energetic regional rallies reminiscent of Trump-style campaign events in the United States. However, the party appears in no particular hurry to produce detailed policies when the next general election remains four years distant, leading to Lowe’s dramatic suggestion that he would resign if a “proper plan” for government was not forthcoming. Of the 30 staff currently employed at the party’s Westminster headquarters, only a single individual – Simon Marcus, who serves as head of policy – is dedicated specifically to policy development. Ultimately, major decisions continue to rest with Farage. “It’s all very much the Nigel show, not the Reform show”, observes one insider with evident frustration.\nA relationship under strain\nUntil this explosive confrontation, Farage and Lowe are understood to have “got on very well personally”, according to party sources, as demonstrated by their mutual admiration frequently expressed on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), where Lowe maintains a prolific presence, regularly posting about his party and issues ranging from migration policy to fishing rights. Yet fundamentally, Lowe is widely regarded as an ideologue, whilst Farage is seen as a political tactician who has navigated the often treacherous waters of British politics for three decades. Farage’s decision-making process is largely predicated on political strategy, informed by what supporters describe as an innate sense of the public mood, whereas Lowe’s approach to decision-making typically centres on his strongly-held belief system and a sense of pragmatism derived from a successful business career managing enterprises ranging from a care home provider to Southampton Football Club.\nThe party leadership has never quite managed to exert much control over Lowe, a former Member of the European Parliament who has leveraged social media platform X to considerable effect, receiving an impressive 20 million views for his posts during this week alone. Such is the volume and unpredictability of his output on the platform that senior Reform officials have established automatic notifications each time he posts, enabling them to monitor his numerous public remarks.\nThe businessman has steadily emerged as one of the party’s most popular figures amongst the rank-and-file membership in recent months – a standing that was significantly enhanced after he received the public endorsement of Elon Musk in January, shortly after the X owner had controversially declared that Farage should be replaced as Reform’s leader. Musk’s unexpected intervention represented a devastating blow for Farage, who had reportedly been harbouring hopes for a substantial £100 million party donation from the billionaire entrepreneur. Unsurprisingly, it “went down like a s—storm” at party headquarters, according to one well-placed source. Those present with Farage recall that he was “apoplectic” upon receiving the news.\nA pattern of internal conflicts\nFarage’s public confrontation with Lowe is not the first such clash he has experienced with a Reform colleague. Last year, he became embroiled in a bitter dispute with Ben Habib, his former deputy, after replacing him with Richard Tice in a controversial leadership reshuffle. Habib resurfaced prominently in January to suggest that Farage had become “too big for his boots”, shortly after Farage had levelled precisely the same accusation against him. He claimed that, within the party structure, “It is king Nigel and everyone has to do what he says, when he says it.” In remarks unlikely to have ameliorated the increasingly strained relationship between Farage and Lowe, Habib added pointedly: “If there was a mechanism by which leadership could change then Rupert Lowe would be a fantastic leader.”\nAlthough Lowe has faced criticism from some quarters for making his grievances public on Thursday, Reform insiders suggest that in the absence of any effective mechanism for raising concerns within the party’s internal structures, he found himself with few alternatives. Despite repeated efforts to democratise the party, there remain very few checks and balances on the leadership and minimal meaningful debate regarding Reform’s strategic direction. According to one disillusioned party source: “All you can do is appeal and say, ‘Please, Nigel. Please, Nigel’…[Farage] has just responded in his typical combative manner and exacerbated the problem.”\nPublic airing of grievances\nLowe appeared to air this internal discord publicly in his statement released on Friday evening, when he declared: “It is no surprise that this vexatious statement has been issued the day after my reasonable and constructive questions of Nigel and the Reform structure…\n“All I stated was that communication needs to improve, delegation needs to improve, structure needs to improve – these are all reasonable requests of a party looking to form the next Government… I have been pushing for this behind the scenes for many months, with zero success. I have been frozen out of meetings, policy discussions, press conferences and more. My repeated requests for better communication and regular meetings have been ignored and mocked.”\nThe attack on Farage, explicit as it was, also contained barely concealed indications of the conflict that would inevitably follow if the party leadership proceeded with what Lowe characterised as an attempt to “kick me out over false claims”.\nSerious allegations exchanged\nWithout providing any prior warning to Lowe, the party announced in its statement on Friday night that the MP had been accused of bullying two female members of staff and that a formal complaint had been submitted to parliamentary authorities. The statement further revealed that Lowe had been reported to the police concerning allegations that he had “on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence” against Yusuf – accusations vigorously denied by Lowe, who described them as fabrications designed to damage his reputation and standing within the party.\nFarage’s position of strength\nFarage’s confidence in confronting Lowe so publicly, in a dispute that undeniably marks the conclusion of Reform’s political honeymoon period, will owe much to what Lowe himself described as his leader’s messianic quality – as demonstrated during the former Ukip leader’s ultimately successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. A YouGov poll conducted in February found that an overwhelming 91 per cent of voters who supported Reform at last year’s general election held a favourable view of Farage, while merely seven per cent expressed an unfavourable opinion. Despite Farage having relinquished formal ownership of Reform, the party structure evidently remains configured very much to Farage’s advantage. The formal mechanism established to remove a Reform leader requires 50 per cent of party members to request a ballot in writing (or, at least 50 Reform MPs if the party’s parliamentary representation should ever exceed 100 members).\nFarage is therefore likely to have concluded that no individual currently poses a genuine threat to his leadership position – notwithstanding Lowe’s significant and growing popularity among party members.\nLowe’s stark warning on Friday that “this is our party as much as Nigel’s” suggests, however, that he fundamentally disagrees with this assessment of the power dynamics within Reform. The stage appears set for a protracted and potentially destructive power struggle that could significantly impact the party’s electoral prospects.\nThe broader implications\nThis deeply personal feud raises profound questions about Reform’s future trajectory. Can a party that positions itself as an anti-establishment force successfully navigate the transition towards becoming a serious contender for governmental power? The structural challenges highlighted by Lowe – including inadequate policy development, opaque decision-making processes, and excessive centralisation of authority – represent genuine obstacles to Reform’s ambitions.\nMoreover, the dispute underscores the perennial difficulty faced by political movements built around charismatic individuals. Farage’s undeniable popularity among Reform voters provides him with substantial political capital, yet his apparent reluctance to establish robust institutional frameworks or to tolerate dissenting voices echoes patterns observed in his previous political ventures. As one former Ukip official remarked privately, “Nigel creates parties in his own image, but struggles with the collaborative compromises necessary for sustainable growth.”\nFor Reform members and supporters, the spectacle of their representatives engaging in such public recriminations represents a disheartening departure from the party’s stated commitment to offering a coherent alternative to traditional politics. Whether this represents a temporary squall or the beginning of a more fundamental fracturing remains to be seen, but the damage to Reform’s carefully cultivated image as a unified force for political change is undeniable.\nAs British voters observe this increasingly acrimonious dispute, many will question whether Reform genuinely offers the stable and principled leadership it claims, or whether it is ultimately destined to replicate the internal divisions that have periodically undermined other challenger parties in British political history. The resolution of this conflict between Farage and Lowe may well determine Reform’s long-term viability as a significant force in UK politics.\nComment\nReform has lost or removed a very large number of candidates who campaigned really hard for the party during the election, mostly at their own expense, the key policy was that all candidates supported Reform UK policies, but they were free to have their own opinion, however since the election.\nMany of these candidates have been removed for trivial reasons, or they have been pressured to stand down, and in the meantime, the party is pandering to Conservatives who are jumping ship simply to keep their seats, and we must ask ourselves if we really want these people.\nRupert remains the only Reform UK MP who continues to ask the questions about issues that concern the public, and in the meantime, since entering parliament, Nigel Farage has taken a softer and softer position, making all but the most dedicated Farage fans question his loyalty.\nIf Reform is to survive, it needs to democratise and despite the claims made recently by Farage, that has not happened, there is a serious storm on the horizon and if it is not addresses, the consequences for Reform UK will be catastrophic and that will be a disaster for our nation.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_how-germanys-economic-prowess-has-diminished/content_375.html": "How Germany’s Economic Prowess Has Diminished\nIn a remarkable turn of events, Germany’s economy has experienced a dramatic downturn over the past four years, contrasting sharply with America’s economic boom. The nation has suffered its worst recession in decades, marked by the unexpected return of high inflation and falling real wages. Perhaps most striking is the reversal of fortunes within the Eurozone: while Southern European nations like Greece, Italy, and Spain—once criticised for their economic management—are now showing strong performance, Germany has unexpectedly become Europe’s weakest economic link.\nThis decline represents a significant departure from Germany’s historical position. For many decades, the nation was celebrated as an economic miracle, characterised by low inflation, high growth, and manufacturing excellence. Germans took justifiable pride in their economy and the quality of life it provided. However, a series of unforced errors—including misguided austerity measures, problematic energy policies, and overdependence on exports—has led to a markedly different economic landscape. The country now faces losing ground to China, whilst its prestigious automotive industry falls into crisis and the spectre of a global trade war looms.\nThe Energy Crisis and Its Aftermath\nThe surge in gas prices in 2022 proved particularly challenging for a German economy heavily dependent on cheap gas, contributing significantly to inflationary pressures. While these price increases have largely subsided, they alone cannot explain the fundamental drift in Germany’s economic performance. Instead, the nation appears to be entering a process of deindustrialisation similar to what the United Kingdom experienced in the early 1980s.\nThe Austerity Trap\nBy 2010, during the global recession, German economic orthodoxy had become dominated by the concept of “black zero”—an almost obsessive focus on achieving zero budget deficits. This devotion to austerity and fiscal frugality, while perhaps admirable in principle, has proved problematic in practice. As Keynes noted, government budgets differ fundamentally from household finances, particularly during periods of economic stagnation.\nThis pursuit of austerity has resulted in severe underinvestment across the economy. IMF data reveals that Germany’s public infrastructure spending has lagged behind many comparable nations, with the effects becoming increasingly visible. The German railway system, once renowned for its efficiency and punctuality, now suffers from critical shortages and deteriorating service quality, shocking the public as old certainties fade. Meanwhile, as American investment has soared, Germany has fallen behind, creating a widening gap between the two economies.\nThe Export Dilemma\nOne of post-war Germany’s economic pillars has been its success in manufacturing and exports. Since the mid-1990s, exports as a share of German GDP have doubled to 43%—four times the American share and twice that of China. While this might seem impressive, it has potentially crowded out other economic sectors. Unlike the UK and US, which experienced deindustrialisation due to Chinese competition, Germany initially succeeded by specialising in high-tech industries such as chemicals and automotive manufacturing.\nHowever, this very success has perhaps blinded German policymakers to the need for economic diversification. The country’s current account surplus has reached 7% of GDP—a figure that, while potentially appealing from a simplistic perspective, actually indicates dangerous economic imbalances, including excessive capital outflows and insufficient domestic investment and consumer spending.\nUntapped Potential\nThe situation isn’t entirely dire. Germany remains a wealthy nation with the highest savings rate in the developed world. If these substantial savings could be effectively channelled into meaningful infrastructure investment, they could catalyse broader economic recovery. The strong growth of the 1990s and 2000s was significantly bolstered by Chinese demand for German exports, but China’s current economic challenges and slowing demand create new headwinds for Germany.\nEnergy Policy Missteps\nGerman energy policy has been marked by unfortunate decisions. Nuclear power, which provided a quarter of Germany’s energy in 1990, was scheduled for phase-out following the Fukushima disaster. The gap was filled partially by fossil fuels but primarily by Russian natural gas. Despite concerns about Russian foreign policy, German leaders hoped that trade would foster closer ties with Moscow. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine shattered this assumption and created significant energy security challenges for Germany’s electricity-intensive industrial sector.\nWhile Germany has shown remarkable adaptability in reducing consumption and securing alternative supplies from Norway and American LNG, the economy remains vulnerable to future energy price spikes.\nThe Automotive Industry Crisis\nThe German automotive sector, long the world’s envy for its engineering excellence, design capability, and prestigious brands, now faces an unprecedented crisis. The industry has rapidly lost its leading position in the electric vehicle market to Chinese manufacturers, who benefit from substantial state subsidies and can undercut German prices. German manufacturers appear trapped in the internal combustion era, leading to job losses that reverberate through automobile-dependent communities.\nThe impact is particularly visible in places like Ingolstadt, Germany’s second-richest city and home to Audi. Following a 91% decline in profits and significant job cuts, the entire city’s economy has been affected, highlighting the risks of over-reliance on the automotive sector.\nBroader Economic Challenges\nBeyond these specific issues, German businesses face high taxes and regulations that increase costs and potentially hamper innovation. While American and Chinese tech firms demonstrate remarkable growth and stock market performance, German and European firms appear disconnected from this crucial sector of the modern economy. This can be attributed to several factors, including:\n– A more regulated labour market that discourages flexible hiring practices\n– The historical dominance of US tech firms and their economies of scale\n– Europe’s focus on implementing costly regulations like GDPR\n– Demographic challenges, including an aging population and low birth rates\nFuture Prospects\nDespite these challenges, Germany’s economy isn’t destined for permanent decline. The country maintains significant strengths, including high savings levels, a skilled workforce, and a robust manufacturing base. The Euro has generally benefited German exports, and despite recent difficulties, German living standards remain among the world’s highest. When accounting for longer holidays and shorter working hours, German productivity per hour worked approaches US levels.\nTo address its current challenges, Germany could abandon its fiscal conservatism and address the costs of underinvestment. The country needs to prepare for potential deindustrialisation and work to rebalance its economy away from its heavy reliance on exports. However, the looming threat of a global trade war and increased tariffs poses significant challenges for Germany’s export-oriented economy, potentially complicating any attempted economic transformation.\nSummary\n• Germany has experienced its worst recession in decades over the past four years, while Southern European nations like Greece, Italy, and Spain have outperformed expectations – a striking reversal from previous economic dynamics\n• The “black zero” policy (obsession with zero budget deficits) led to severe underinvestment in infrastructure, affecting services like the railway system that were once renowned for excellence\n• Exports make up 43% of German GDP – four times higher than the US and twice China’s level – creating an unbalanced economy with excessive capital outflows and insufficient domestic investment\n• The country’s energy strategy backfired – phasing out nuclear power led to dependence on Russian gas, creating vulnerabilities exposed by the Ukraine invasion in 2022\n• Germany’s automotive industry is in crisis, losing ground to Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers who benefit from state subsidies. This affects entire communities built around car manufacturing\n• The country faces significant demographic challenges with an aging population and low birth rates, likely leading to lower growth and innovation rates\n• Business competitiveness is hampered by high taxes and regulations, while German firms have largely missed out on the tech boom dominated by US companies\n• Despite these challenges, Germany retains considerable strengths:\n– Highest savings rate in the developed world\n– Highly skilled workforce\n– Strong manufacturing base\n– High living standards\n– Competitive productivity per hour worked\n• The threat of a global trade war and increased tariffs poses particular risks for Germany’s export-dependent economy",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-red-sea-debacle-exposes-gaps-in-uk-defence/content_807.html": "The Red Sea Debacle Exposes Gaps in UK Defence\nIntroduction:\nIn the world of naval operations, setbacks and challenges are par for the course. However, when the Secretary of the Navy of a major ally publicly calls for increased defense spending, it’s a red flag that can’t be ignored. The recent visit of Secretary Del Toro to the UK highlighted the stark contrast between the capabilities of the US and Royal Navies. The ensuing discussion brought to light a series of concerns, including recruitment struggles, global hotspots, and the urgent need for adequate funding.\nThe Red Sea Crisis:\nThe Red Sea has become a focal point for naval activities, showcasing the intricate web of global interdependencies. Despite defensive efforts transitioning into offensive operations, shipping through crucial chokepoints like the Bab el Mandeb and the Suez Canal has plummeted, causing a ripple effect on global trade. Container ship transits are down by a staggering 80%, with significant economic consequences, as highlighted by a report from LSEG Shipping Research.\nUS Naval Dominance:\nThe US Navy, with its inherent commitment to ‘freedom of navigation,’ has positioned an aircraft carrier and five escorts in the Red Sea – a force larger than the entire Royal Navy’s escort fleet. This stark reality raises questions about the contributions of other nations and underscores the importance of maintaining open sea lanes. Secretary Del Toro emphasized the frustration felt when political agendas and talk of a Euro-solution fall short of practical commitments.\nGlobal Naval Challenges:\nThe discussion extended beyond the Red Sea, delving into other contested regions like the Black Sea, the Arctic, and the Southern and Eastern China Seas. The increasing belligerence of China and the encircling of Taiwan pose significant geopolitical challenges. The complexity of these situations demands robust naval capabilities, making the case for sustained investment and international cooperation.\nRecruitment and Retention Woes:\nNaval recruiting and retention emerged as a global concern, with maritime recruitment down 9% across the board. The UK Armed Forces are grappling with diminishing numbers, prompting a need for strategic solutions. Conversations about delayed training and bureaucratic inefficiencies leading to a shortage of skilled personnel underscore the urgency of addressing these issues.\nThe Funding Black Hole:\nAs the world faces mounting uncertainties, the Haythornthwaite Review of Armed Forces Incentivisation has yet to yield tangible results. The UK Government’s lukewarm approach to defense spending, with promises contingent on economic conditions, is no longer sufficient. The US Secretary of the Navy’s polite yet stern call for increased commitment echoes the sentiment that more funding is imperative for maintaining a robust defense infrastructure.\nConclusion:\nThe Red Sea crisis serves as a wake-up call for the UK, prompting a reevaluation of defense priorities. The challenges extend beyond naval capabilities to encompass recruitment, retention, and global strategic concerns. As the world navigates through troubled waters, the call for increased defense spending and strategic planning is louder than ever. It’s time for the UK to heed the advice, do better, and ensure the security of its maritime interests in an ever-changing geopolitical landscape.\nOur defence has been badly neglected, we spend billions on scroungers, yet we do not invest enough into the security of our country, outrageous!",

This location, so deeply steeped in unimaginable cruelty, became known as Romania’s house of horror. Far from being a work of twisted fiction, this represents the chilling reality of the Pitești experiments—one of the 20th century’s most terrifying yet least-known atrocities.\nIn the late 1940s, as the world struggled to recover from the devastating aftermath of the Second World War, Eastern Europe fell under the iron grip of Communism. Romania witnessed the rise of a new regime—paranoid, ruthless, and determined to eliminate any trace of dissent. The authorities perceived enemies everywhere, particularly amongst the young and educated, and anyone who dared to think independently. They devised a sinister plan, not merely to silence their opponents, but to destroy them from within—to break their spirits, force them to renounce their beliefs, and transform them into instruments of their own destruction.\nThe Second World War had left Europe in ruins, and as the dust settled, the Soviet Union emerged as the dominant power, its influence spreading across Eastern Europe like an ominous shadow. Romania, previously a kingdom with its own complex challenges, found itself ensnared by this new communist regime. The nation’s role in the largest conflict in human history had been complicated; initially caught between the behemoths of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Romania attempted to maintain a delicate balance but ultimately was forced to cede territory to the Soviets.\nDuring this period, the Iron Guard—a fascist, ultra-nationalist movement—rose to power, capitalising on this national humiliation. The movement aligned Romania with Nazi Germany, believing Hitler’s regime would assist in reclaiming their lost territories and strengthen their position against the Soviet threat. Romania participated in Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union, a decision that would prove catastrophic. As the tide of war shifted and by 1944, Romania found itself in the crosshairs of a rapidly advancing Red Army. The country’s leadership, sensing an imminent dramatic change, switched allegiances, joining the Allies in a desperate attempt to avoid complete destruction.\nDespite this last-minute change of heart, the damage was irreversible. Romania emerged from the conflict battered and broken—a once-proud kingdom reduced to a Soviet satellite state. The war had exacted a devastating toll on the land, its people, and the national psyche. Romania’s leaders, desperate to prove their loyalty to their new Soviet masters, embarked on a brutal campaign to root out any form of dissent or disloyalty.\nIn 1947, King Michael I of Romania was forced to abdicate under Soviet pressure, and the People’s Republic of Romania was proclaimed. The Communist Party, backed by Moscow, swiftly consolidated power, ushering in a period of intense repression. The regime became obsessed with purging the country of any potential threats, whether real or imagined. Intellectuals, former members of the democratic opposition, clergy, and especially students—anyone perceived as a potential future leader—became prime targets.\nHowever, the regime’s ambitions extended beyond mere punishment. They sought to ‘re-educate’ their targets. The goal wasn’t simply to enforce compliance with the party line; they aimed to completely erase any trace of former beliefs and replace them with unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party. The young and educated, those exposed to Western ideas, those who still dared to think freely—these were the people the regime feared most.\nThis is where Pitești enters the narrative. Located approximately 112 kilometres northwest of Bucharest, Pitești prison was one of many facilities used to detain political prisoners. However, it was here that the regime decided to implement their methods of repression to unprecedented levels. They selected this prison, with its population of young, educated prisoners, as a testing ground for an experiment in terror—a place where psychological and physical torture would reach their most extreme forms.\nThe experiment began in 1949, merely two years after Romania’s official transition to communism. By this time, the new regime had already initiated its brutal crackdown on perceived threats. Alexandru Nicolski, a high-ranking officer in the Securitate (Romania’s secret police), emerged as a key figure. Nicolski, driven by fanatical commitment to communism, believed that securing the regime’s future required eradicating opposition at its root. However, Nicolski wasn’t satisfied with conventional methods of repression; he sought to create a new kind of loyalty, one born from total submission, where the very concept of resistance would become unthinkable.\nNicolski’s twisted vision was implemented by Eugen Țurcanu, a former student leader who had initially been imprisoned for his involvement with the anti-communist National Peasants’ Party. In a dark twist of fate, Țurcanu turned against his former comrades, offering his services to the regime in exchange for his own survival. He became the chief architect of the Pitești experiment, leading a group of prisoners who were coerced or manipulated into becoming torturers themselves.\nThe methods employed at Pitești weren’t merely designed to inflict pain; they were engineered to annihilate the human spirit. Prisoners endured relentless beatings, often administered by their fellow inmates under Țurcanu’s orders. These weren’t random acts of violence but systematic, brutal assaults intended to break the body as a prelude to breaking the mind. The beatings were so severe that many prisoners suffered permanent injuries.\nSleep deprivation formed another crucial component of the torture regime. Prisoners were often kept awake for days, their senses dulled and minds clouded by exhaustion. The goal was to wear them down to the point where they would do or say anything to make it stop. Starvation was perhaps the most insidious aspect of the physical torture—prisoners received just enough food to stay alive, but not enough to maintain their strength. Over time, their bodies weakened, and their ability to resist, either physically or mentally, gradually eroded.\nYet the physical torture, horrifying as it was, paled in comparison to the psychological torment inflicted. One of the most terrifying methods involved forced betrayals—prisoners were coerced or manipulated into betraying their friends, comrades, and even their own beliefs. This wasn’t simply about creating informants; it was about making them complicit in others’ destruction. In some cases, prisoners were forced to participate in the torture of their fellow inmates—people they had once trusted and called friends.\nThe regime particularly exploited Romania’s deep Christian tradition through mock religious ceremonies. Many prisoners at Pitești were devout believers, and the regime staged grotesque parodies of religious rituals, forcing prisoners to blaspheme, desecrate religious symbols, and renounce their faith in the most humiliating ways imaginable. Prisoners were sometimes forced to perform mock baptisms using urine while reciting twisted versions of religious prayers. Others were made to participate in mock communions, consuming food that had been defiled in the most degrading ways.\nThe victims were also forced to write false confessions that were not only untrue but deeply humiliating. These confessions were often read aloud before other inmates, further degrading the individual and reinforcing the regime’s control over every aspect of their lives. The confessions weren’t merely about admitting to fictional crimes; they were about renouncing everything that had ever given their lives meaning.\nConstantin Ticu Dumitrescu, a law student aged just 22 when arrested, represents one of these young men held at Pitești. Ticu was active in the National Peasants’ Party, a political group opposing the Communist regime. His crime? Believing in democracy and attempting to organise his fellow students to resist the creeping tide of totalitarianism. For this, he was thrown into Pitești, where he would face horrors beyond imagination. Ticu endured the full brutality of the Pitești experiment—relentless beatings, forced confessions, and psychological torture that was the hallmark of Țurcanu’s reign of terror. He later wrote that the worst aspect was the sense of betrayal—being forced to turn against his friends and become an instrument of their torment, all while knowing that refusing would result in the same fate befalling him.\nAnother victim, George Calciu-Dumitreasa, was a theology student, activist, and devout Christian. His faith served as his anchor, but that anchor was ruthlessly attacked at Pitești. Calciu was forced to participate in countless mock religious ceremonies that pushed him to the breaking point while also participating in others’ torture. Yet, remarkably, Calciu’s faith survived. He later stated that it was his faith, battered and bruised as it was, that kept him alive through the darkest days.\nEven after leaving Pitești, Calciu’s ordeal continued. He was transferred between various prisons and wasn’t released until 1963. In 1979, he received another ten-year sentence, spending most of that period in solitary confinement. Finally released in 1985 and exiled from Romania, he settled in the United States and continued his work.\nNot everyone managed to maintain their resilience. Many victims were so thoroughly broken by the experience that they were never the same again. Some succumbed to despair, others were driven to madness, and some perished from the torture they endured. The psychological scars left by the Pitești experiment were deep and lasting, affecting not just the survivors but also their families and communities.\nAurel Vişovan, another young student caught in the regime’s dragnet, was arrested for his involvement in a student group deemed subversive. Like the others, he endured horrific torture, but what haunted him most was how the experiment forced prisoners to turn against each other. Vişovan later wrote about his experiences, describing how the regime’s strategy of forced betrayals destroyed the bonds of trust and camaraderie that had once existed among the prisoners at Pitești. He received a twenty-year hard labour prison sentence following a mock trial, finally gaining release in 1964 before being exiled to Munich.\nFor many survivors, the end of the Pitești experiment didn’t bring relief. They were released into a world forever changed, haunted by memories of the torture they had endured and the people they had lost. Many died in prison, their bodies broken by torture. Others were executed after being forced to confess to crimes they hadn’t committed. For those who survived, life after Pitești presented a different kind of struggle—attempting to rebuild shattered lives in a world that couldn’t or wouldn’t understand what they’d experienced.\nWhile exact numbers remain unclear, it’s estimated that between 750 and 5,000 people passed through Pitești prison’s doors, with up to 200 perishing at the site. By 1952, the Pitești experiment was drawing to a close, not due to any sudden attack of conscience by the regime, but because it had become too brutal and uncontrollable, even for a regime that thrived on repression. The horrors of Pitești had become so extreme that they threatened to expose the regime’s darkest secrets to the wider world.\nBy the early 1950s, cracks began appearing in the Romanian Communist Party’s leadership. The experiment, which had been carried out with high-ranking officials’ approval, if not their direct involvement, was becoming a liability. Word of the atrocities committed at Pitești had started to leak out, raising concerns that these revelations could undermine the regime’s image both domestically and internationally. This was particularly problematic as Romania was attempting to present itself as a model of socialist progress to the outside world.\nMoreover, unease was growing within the ranks of the Securitate itself. Some officers began to fear that the methods used at Pitești were too extreme and dangerous. There was increasing recognition that the cycle of violence and betrayal fostered by the experiment could spiral out of control, potentially turning even loyal Communists against the state. In a paranoid regime like Romania’s, the line between loyalty and treachery was razor-thin, and the Pitești experiment had pushed that line to breaking point.\nIn response to these concerns, the regime quietly shut down the experiment in 1952, reclassifying Pitești prison as an ordinary penal institution. However, the end of the experiment didn’t bring justice for its victims. The regime worked diligently to cover up what had happened, destroying evidence and silencing those who knew too much.\nNevertheless, the truth couldn’t remain buried forever. In the years that followed, details of the Pitești experiment gradually emerged, and the Romanian government was eventually forced to address the atrocities that had taken place. This led to a series of trials beginning in 1954, where some key figures involved in the experiment faced justice—or at least a semblance of it.\nEugen Țurcanu, the principal architect of the Pitești experiment, was among those put on trial. His role in the torture and psychological abuse of countless prisoners was undeniable, and in 1954, he was sentenced to death and executed. However, Țurcanu’s execution served as much to silence him as to deliver justice. The regime was eager to portray him as a rogue actor who had taken things too far, rather than acknowledge its own complicity in the horrors of Pitești.\nAlexandru Nicolski, the Securitate officer overseeing the experiment, was also brought to trial. Unlike Țurcanu, Nicolski avoided the death penalty, receiving a lengthy prison sentence instead. His trial was a carefully controlled affair designed to distance the higher-ups from the atrocities committed at Pitești. The regime’s narrative was clear: Pitești was an aberration, the work of a few overzealous individuals, not a reflection of the system as a whole.\nThis, of course, was far from the truth. The Pitești experiment was the product of a regime that valued ideological purity over human life and saw no limits to the cruelty it could inflict in the name of its twisted vision of society. The trials were an attempt to whitewash history, to shift blame onto a few scapegoats while leaving intact the system that had enabled such horrors.\nEven after the trials, many of those responsible for the Pitești experiment never faced justice. High-ranking officials who had known about or even approved the experiment were quietly reassigned or retired, their roles in the atrocities conveniently forgotten. The Romanian government continued to suppress information about Pitești for decades, and it wasn’t until after the fall of Communism in 1989 that the full truth emerged.\nThe end of the Pitești experiment may have halted the immediate horrors, but its legacy lingered for decades. For the survivors, the physical and psychological scars remained long after the prison gates closed. Many struggled with guilt, shame, and trauma for the rest of their lives, haunted by memories of the torture they had endured and even inflicted upon others. The Pitești experiments left an indelible dark stain on Romania’s history—a shocking example of the dangers of unchecked power and what can happen when a regime is willing to sacrifice its own people in pursuit of ideological purity.\nComment\nIn a world where those who are fighting to speak the truth, are hunted by those who wish to silence them, The Piteşti Experiment, should never be dismissed as an event from dark history that could never happen again.",

Many of them said they believed the girl told the truth when she accused a group of 12 of their teenage compatriots of gang-raping her in a hotel room at the two-star Pambos Napa Rocks Hotel in Ayia Napa three weeks ago.\n“To the British teen: I am Israeli and I am terrified by what my fellow citizens did to you and how you were treated consequently by Cypriot law enforcement. I want to say that I fully believe you and admire your courage not to remain silent. I really hope that eventually, you will get justice and your life will be recovered as quickly as possible,” wrote Michael Uritsky who donated £10.\n“I believe you, and did from the beginning. Stand strong for justice on all counts. You are not alone. Many of us in Israel believe you and support you,” commented Shelley Bogen who also sent £10.\nEarlier this week, the girl’s Cypriot lawyer, Andreas Pittadjis, resigned, citing serious disagreement with his client about how to handle the case.\nThe girl’s mother, currently in Cyprus, told the press that the family decided to accept legal assistance from the British legal group Justice Abroad, an organisation which, according to its website, “has been set up to help those trying to find their way through foreign justice systems with all the associated hurdles that present”. Together they plan to assemble an expert legal team from both the UK and Cyprus in order to challenge the many breaches of the teenager’s rights they claim took place since the case first started.\nIn the statement published on the crowdfunding page the family says: “In the early hours of Sunday the 28th of July 2019, following a week of traumatic events, our daughter was arrested for allegedly making a false allegation of rape in Cyprus and is currently being detained in prison awaiting trial. We maintain that the statement was given under duress and in breach of her rights, resulting in the collapse of the initial investigation and charges of public mischief being made against her. She is alone in a prison abroad after an awful series of events, we just want to bring her home.”\nThe 19-year-old was charged for making false claims after she withdrew her complaint that she had been gang-raped. She is due back in court on August 19.\nCOMMENT\nThis young lady deserves a fair trial it’s been sickening to see the ‘trial by proxy’ that has been happening within these posts.\nCONSENT CAN BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME!\nFor those of you still in the sexual dark ages, it does not make a difference, if you walk down the street in a thong and engage in sex with a dozen partners, CONSENT CAN BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME! I sincerely hope that your daughters are never subjected to the Pig ignorance that I have seen here, if the they are ever unfortunate enough to suffer the same fate.\nIf the police had conducted themselves properly, they would have had a signed declaration from her refusing legal representation that would/should have been witnessed by an independent third party, they do not have that.\nIt is not just this young lady who is on trial, the boys who were released, guilty or not, have demonstrated that they have no respect for women by taking and releasing that video, an act that is a serious crime in the UK, therefore, for that alone, they are beyond contempt.\nThen we have her so called solicitor who resigned, well, he has a chequered history to say the least. I can’t/won’t comment any further, but if you do some research, you can find out for yourself.\nIn the meantime, the accused were released and any possibility of a fair trial now gone, based on a gruelling EIGHT HOUR interview of a female tourist, without representation.\nWhatever the facts are, the world’s media are making a meal out of this, quite rightly so, because this is not just about what did or did not happen, it is about the entire investigative process. This goes far and beyond Ayia Napa, or even Cyprus, it leaves a legacy of shame!",

We believe this to be the first study of its kind in the sector, and the results will help to develop the initiatives of the Agents Together foundation.”\nShe says the findings show it’s now time to act.\n“I am asking agents; business owners and individuals to commit to supporting a cultural shift in mental health awareness and education across the industry.\n“Together we can appraise employers approaches and work closely to develop best practice. Not only responding to mental health issues but to pro actively reduce stigma and improve ways in which wellbeing and performance can work hand in hand.”\nAgents Together will be conducting further research this year as well as mounting an education programme, which Edmundson hopes will pay off for individual agents and the industry as a whole – in terms of well-being and financially.\n“Deloitte’s research in January 2020 suggested that the benefits to businesses who embrace wellbeing are huge, with a return of £5 to every £1 spent on Mental Health in the workplace, and that was before Covid.\n“The reality is this is quite unknown territory for many people, and we will aim to be the support that individuals and businesses need.”\nSince June last year Agents Together has undertaken some 230 mentorships with 157 volunteer mentors.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_hong-kongs-new-national-security-laws-undermine-civil-liberties/content_59.html": "Hong Kong’s new national security laws ‘undermine civil liberties’\nHong Kong’s new security law comes into force amid human rights concerns. The law, known as Article 23, has been criticised internationally over fears it could erode civil liberties.\nA new national security law has come into force in Hong Kong despite growing international criticism that it could erode freedoms in the China-ruled city and damage its international financial hub credentials. The law, also known as Article 23, came into effect at midnight on Saturday, days after Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing lawmakers passed it unanimously, fast-tracking legislation to plug what authorities called national security loopholes.\nHong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said the law “accomplished a historic mission, living up to the trust placed in us by the Central [Chinese] Authorities”.\nHe has often cited Hong Kong’s “constitutional responsibility” to create the new legislation as required by the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution since its handover from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. Lee also said the law was necessary to “prevent black-clad violence”, a reference to Hong Kong’s massive and at times violent pro-democracy protests in 2019, which brought hundreds of thousands to the streets demanding greater autonomy from Beijing’s grip.\nA previous attempt to pass Article 23 was scrapped in 2003 after 500,000 people protested. This time around, public criticism has been muted amid the security crackdown.\nWhat does the new law entail?\nHong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee that its high degree of autonomy and freedoms would be protected under a “one country, two systems” formula.\nCurrently, the new Article 23 law has expanded the British colonial-era offence of “sedition” to include inciting hatred against China’s Communist Party leadership, with an aggravated sentence of up to 10 years in gaol.\nUnder the security law, penalties can run up to life in prison for sabotage endangering national security, treason and insurrection; 20 years for espionage and sabotage; and 14 years for external interference.\nCity leader Lee is also now empowered to create new offences carrying gaol terms of up to seven years through subsidiary legislation, while the security minister can impose punitive measures on activists who are overseas, including cancelling their passports.\nMoreover, police powers have also been expanded to permit detaining people for up to 16 days without charge – a jump from the current 48 hours – and to restrict a suspect from meeting solicitors and communicating with others.\nInternational condemnation\nThe United States, the European Union, Japan and the UK have been among the law’s strongest critics, with UK Foreign Minister David Cameron saying it would “further damage the rights and freedoms” of those in the city.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday expressed “deep concern” that the law could be used to undermine rights and curb dissent, adding it could damage Hong Kong’s reputation as an international finance hub.\nMeanwhile, Australia, the UK and Taiwan have updated their travel advisories for Hong Kong, urging citizens to exercise caution.\n“You could break the laws without intending to and be detained without charge and denied access to a solicitor,” the Australian government said.\nIn a joint statement led by the overseas-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, 145 community and advocacy groups have also condemned the law and called for sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials involved its passage, as well as review the status of Hong Kong’s Economic & Trade Offices worldwide.\n“It’s time for the United States to step up for political prisoners and freedom in Hong Kong. Every time we let authoritarians get away with atrocities, we risk other bad actors attempting to do the same,” wanted Hong Kong activist Frances Hui said in Washington, during a news conference with the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), which advises Congress.\nProtests have also taken place in Taipei’s fashionable Ximending shopping district, where more than a dozen Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet activists gathered to protest the law and shout their denunciations. Other protests are planned in Australia, the UK, Canada, Japan and the US.\nBut authorities in Hong Kong have “strongly condemned such political manoeuvres with skewed, fact-twisting, scaremongering and panic-spreading remarks”.\nWhat is China’s stance?\nChina has defended Hong Kong’s security crackdown as essential to restoring order after months of sometimes violent antigovernment and pro-democracy protests in 2019.\nAbout 291 people have been arrested for national security offences, with 174 people and five companies charged so far.\nChinese authorities insist all are equal before the security laws that have restored stability, but while individual rights are respected no freedoms are absolute.\nSummary\n• Hong Kong’s new national security law, known as Article 23, has come into force despite international concerns over erosion of civil liberties\n• Key provisions of the law:\n– Expands sedition offense to include inciting hatred against China’s Communist Party leadership, with up to 10 years in jail\n– Allows life imprisonment for acts like sabotage endangering national security, treason, insurrection\n– Empowers authorities to create new offenses with 7 years jail, cancel passports of overseas activists\n– Permits detaining suspects for 16 days without charge, restricting lawyer access\n• The law has drawn condemnation from the US, EU, UK, Japan, Australia, Taiwan\n– Concerns it undermines rights, damages Hong Kong’s financial hub status\n– Travel advisories warn citizens could be arrested without intending to break the law\n• Protests against the law have occurred in Hong Kong, Taiwan, with more planned globally\n• China defends the law as necessary for restoring order after 2019 pro-democracy protests\n– Says it has arrested 291 people so far under the security laws\n– Insists rights are respected but no freedoms are absolute\nJeremy Hunt in particular seems to be very sympathetic towards China, this is a real threat to us, little by little, we are being supressed and silenced, we need to fight back now!",

The current figure is around 11,000 – outnumbering the resident population of 6,000 by almost two to one. The locals are on the verge of abandoning their island as their economy and tourism industry have collapsed under the strain.\nThis is an invasion, without a doubt. Ever since Angela Merkel controversially opened Germany’s borders in 2015 at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis, Europe has been overwhelmed by migrants arriving en masse with little desire or ability to integrate or assimilate into their host cultures. Germany in particular has now reached its limit – key workers and professionals are leaving disillusioned as millions of poorly educated migrants remain dependent on the state, representing more of an economic burden than boon for the nation.\nFrance has begun to restrict freedom of movement, a core and formerly sacrosanct EU principle, by closing its border with Italy in an effort to block migrants from leaving Italy and entering France with the ultimate goal of reaching the shores of Great Britain. This leaves Italy and to a lesser extent nowadays Greece on the frontlines of this invasion from Africa, with minimal resources or support and very limited choices in how to respond. Each time a new boatload of migrants successfully reaches the shores of mainland Europe after a dangerous Mediterranean crossing, it simply opens the door and further encourages thousands if not millions more to follow in their footsteps and set off on the same perilous journey. The only real solution according to many experts and policymakers is to allow zero migrants into the EU and turn back anyone attempting illegal entry.\nHowever, despite the protestations of virtue-signaling hypocrites wishing to open the gates to everyone in the name of diversity and humanitarianism, the reality is that Europe as an entire continent is gradually but unmistakably moving further and further to the ideological right in a manner that has not been witnessed since the dark days before the second World War. Ironically, the very immigrants and children of immigrants who came to Europe seeking better lives and opportunities away from poverty, war, and persecution should truly be the ones who fear this far-right resurgence and anti-immigrant backlash the most. An extreme far-right Europe with hardline stances on immigration and national identity could sadly once again embrace the kind of reckless racism, xenophobia, and hate that we had all hoped as a global society we would never allow to happen again after the horrors of fascism in the 20th century.\nThe truth is that the vast majority of ordinary Europeans across the political spectrum are simply tired and frustrated, sick and fed up to the back teeth of uncontrolled mass migration and what they see as the resulting erosion of national cultures and crises of assimilation. And they are getting increasingly angry, but it is a quiet and suppressed anger that therefore cannot be fully gauged until it may be too late to reverse. Nothing is more dangerous than quiet anger left to simmer under the surface because it means any solutions will come suddenly and violently rather than through reasoned discourse. Clearly something needs to be done urgently about this growing migrant crisis, and we desperately need strong, principled leaders acting solely for the good of their own countries and citizens rather than the current crop of pathetic virtue-signaling hypocrite politicians who keep pandering to the noisy minority of leftists, woke activists, large corporations hungry for cheap labor, and NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) elites. Those groups are very keen to encourage unlimited waves of migrants to come to Europe in the name of diversity, economic growth, or cheap nannies and housekeepers – just as long as they can be assured that the newcomers do not actually have to live anywhere near them. And I’m not talking just about out-of-touch celebrities like Gary Lineker – there are many regular upper middle class professionals and politicians throughout Europe promoting these views from hypocritical positions of privilege and isolation. They are the real traitors living in our midst, and it is about time we called them out directly for it rather than tiptoeing around the issue.\nFurthermore, let us make no mistake – this current migrant influx is far from just a temporary crisis or blip that will go away on its own if we just ignore it. Make no mistake, we are not talking about just thousands or even hundreds of thousands of migrants already heading for Europe across North Africa and the Middle East. This is just the beginning of an unprecedented wave. If allowed to continue unchecked, it will rapidly swell into an unstoppable flood of millions more migrants that will completely overwhelm Europe’s capacity to handle them humanely. There will inevitably come a time, whether we like it or not as moral actors, where Europe will have no choice but to firmly close its borders and turn people away simply for lack of resources and ability to help them. So the key question we must ask ourselves is – are we going to display prudence and foresight by making that tough decision now, or are we going to recklessly wait until the entire European continent descends into widespread civil unrest, political extremism, and humanitarian disasters before we belatedly do what must be done? The choice is ours, and the window of opportunity is rapidly closing.\nAt its core, this is an issue of sustainability regarding finite resources and Europe’s limited capacity for absorbing huge influxes of migrants lacking language skills or professional qualifications. Europe is a relatively small continent in terms of land mass compared to Africa, parts of which are plagued by political instability, high birth rates, and endemic poverty. Europe already accepted around 2 million migrants during the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis alone. How many more can realistically be accommodated before the strain becomes too much? This is not an issue of race or religion – Muslim immigrants have already successfully integrated into European societies for decades. This is about masses of people arriving too rapidly to properly integrate at all.\nThe fact is that Europe already has generous social welfare programs, unemployment benefits, universal healthcare, public housing, and education that have been built up since WWII. While admirable, these social programs rely on high taxes and high levels of social trust and are not infinitely expandable. The economic and social costs of taking on too many migrants too fast is too much even for wealthy European nations. Infrastructures will crumble, public trust will evaporate, and far-right extremist parties will continue gaining political power across Europe as moderate conservatives shift further right. We have already seen examples of this in Hungary, Austria, Italy, and even Sweden of all places.\nMany well-meaning activists argue Europe has a humanitarian obligation to open its doors based on its colonial past exploitation of Africa or the West’s failures during the Syrian War. But past historical wrongs do not oblige Europe to commit continental-scale civilizational suicide through reckless idealism. And realistically, Europe cannot unilaterally solve the world’s problems by itself. Africans must be empowered to develop their home countries, not simply flee them forever. Europe can invest in foreign aid, fair trade, and diplomacy to help, but not through continuous waves of migration.\nEurope has a stable civilization worth defending and a moral duty to maintain its liberal democratic values and hard-won social unity. Its leaders need to strike the right balance between humanitarian ideals and pragmatic reality. Some controlled legal immigration is beneficial, but uncontrolled mass influxes of illegal migrants must be curtailed for social stability. This will require tough border security and foreign policy decisions. But the longer Europe waits, the more intractable and extreme the crisis will become. Europe must act soon for the good of all – migrants and citizens alike. The choice belongs to us all.\nIn summary:\n– Thousands of African migrants are arriving in Italy weekly, overwhelming local communities\n– This is an unprecedented wave that will swell if left unchecked\n– Europe is shifting politically to the far-right in response to uncontrolled migration\n– Immigration without integration and assimilation is not sustainable long-term\n– Leaders are pandering to activists but most citizens are quietly angry\n– The migrant influx is just beginning – millions more will likely come\n– At some point, Europe will have no choice but to close its borders\n– The only question is whether this happens before or after widespread unrest\n– Europe has limited capacity to absorb huge migrant flows due to resource constraints\n– Past colonial wrongs don’t oblige Europe to accept unsustainable migration\n– While some legal immigration is beneficial, illegal influxes must be controlled\n– Reckless idealism could lead to civilizational suicide through social instability\n– Europe must act soon with pragmatism and humanitarian ideals in balance\n– The choice and window of opportunity is ours, but closing fast\n– Bold action and leadership is required to stave off impending disaster",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_your-input-has-been-priceless/content_573.html": "Your input has been priceless\nGood afternoon, everyone. I hope you are all well. It has been nonstop. What an interesting time. Today, I had a public meet and greet here in Northampton, where members of the public, Reform supporters, and voters could drop in, meet myself and a couple of the other local Northamptonshire candidates to ask us any questions, offer their support, pick up some leaflets, marketing material, etc. The rest of the day, led by myself, was spent distributing leaflets to all of the supporters who have offered to help. Thank you very, very much to them.\nNow it’s time to sit down and deal with literally the hundreds of responses that I have had to my website election poll. Because I’ve tried, or I’m attempting to do something completely different, and that is rather than just tell the people of Northampton North what I want, I have expressed my opinion, albeit in a very subtle manner. I have actually created an election questionnaire asking local people to give me their thoughts and express their opinions on issues that concern them. This has taken off in a huge way. I have literally had hundreds of responses. These are just yesterday’s and today’s. People haven’t just responded with one- or two-word answers; some of them have gone to town with their responses. Obviously, these are confidential, but they don’t mind me reading out what they’ve written. However, I won’t be giving the names.\n*Here’s one: Question one is, “Who do you normally vote for and why?” The response from this gentleman is, “Voted for Conservatives and Labour. Moreover, I did vote for UKIP when Nigel Farage was campaigning. Both major parties have failed, and I only found Reform because I couldn’t believe what the two parties had to offer, and there was nothing appealing at all. I want change. I’ve lived through a one-party state before, and these are the same socialist, borderline communist nonsense.”\nLet’s have a look at another one here. “Who do you normally vote for and why?” “I was a Conservative member until they took away my right to vote. I voted Conservative most of my adult life because I believed in their policies.” “What should be done to improve the housing crisis?” “Build more affordable accommodation. Build upwards, i.e., flats rather than houses. Flats use less space and can create a sense of community spirit.”\nAnother question here: “What are your thoughts on current and proposed energy policy?” “We need to be self-sufficient. We have the energy supplies. Let’s get rid of foreign energy suppliers.” Let’s go to someone else here: “Who do you normally vote for and why?” “I’m not loyal to any party. I vote for who I think will be best at the time.” “What should be done to improve the housing crisis?” “Build more on brownfield and empty plots, and reuse or convert more empty or derelict sites in town and not so much on greenfields on the edge of town. Build or convert more one-, two-, and three-bed places. We don’t need loads of four- and five-bed places.”\nI think that’s something I’ve said in the past, and it just goes on and on and on. I am so grateful to you all for this wonderful response. I have to say this is an education, and I’m so glad that I have done this. I am also very, very grateful that you are taking the time to give me so much information, to share your thoughts and your concerns about issues both local and national.\nHaving said that, with the sense of despair of the people, I am more than ever feeling this huge weight of responsibility on my shoulders to fight as hard as I can. Because all of these people contacting me directly has not only educated me, inspired me, and motivated me, but it has also humbled me and made me more determined than ever to fight. I was born and bred in Northampton. I know the town inside and out. In fact, I am old enough to still be outraged by the horrors executed on this town’s landscape by the Northampton Development Corporation. A classic Labour mindset: destroy beautiful buildings, destroy culture, and replace it with bland, ugly buildings.\nFor those of you not from Northampton, you may know up until a few years ago when it was quite rightly blown to smithereens, we had the privilege of having a bus station which was one of the ugliest buildings in the country. That’s just one of quite a few which previous councils are responsible for in this town. We had some beautiful buildings. Here is the lesson: once you destroy culture, you cannot get it back. It is gone forever. Interpret that as you will, but that is an empirical fact.\nSo, on that note, I would like to thank you all. I’m going to get back to work now. If you have completed one of these polls, I will write to you personally, every single last one of you, no matter how long it takes. But please keep in mind that I have had hundreds arrive just in the last week or so, and that’s without the hundreds and hundreds more coming through. All these new members who are signing up and joining Reform, we know, sadly, what the outcome of the election will be. What we need now is a party that is strong enough to fight against the nonsense that these people are going to come up with.\nLet’s not forget that the next government is more than likely going to be led by a man who doesn’t know what a woman is and a woman who spontaneously decides to make up her own foreign policy in a room full of men who support terrorists. This is what we have to come, and this is before the lions, who have been conspicuous by their absence, will rear their ugly heads and come for their pound of flesh for the party that they control and pull the strings along with Tony Blair, of course. That’s all for now. Thank you very much, and I’ll see you next time. Bye-bye.",

I sincerely hope that they are repealed as soon as possible.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_lexit-the-movie/content_227.html": "Lexit the Movie: there is a big lie we want to challenge, and we need your help to do it, and we need to do it fast.\nPoliticians and journalists up and down the country have a simple message for you: voting Leave is for eccentric Tories and nationalist UKIPers. Voting Remain is for decent, progressive, internationalist Labour folk.\nThis is a falsehood, a very big one. And we’re going to make a film to explain why.\nWe are the Labour Leave campaign group, run by Labour MPs, campaigning to leave the EU on June 23rd.\nThe Background\nLast week saw the release of Brexit: The Movie. While it made some perfectly valid arguments, it only presented one vision if a post-Brexit Britain, and it’s not one that we and millions of Britons share.\nWe at Labour Leave believe that all Brexit voices deserve to be heard, especially those on the left that are being drowned out by the Dave and Boris side-show.\nWe believe the historic opposition of Britain’s labour movement to the EU needs to be rescued from the official amnesia of the Remain campaign and elements of the Labour party.\nThe referendum is not a Tory play thing, it is about our democratic right to self determination – left voices must be heard.\nOver the last few weeks, we have been working on Lexit: The Movie, which presents the democratic, progressive case for leaving the European Union, but to fully realise our vision, we really need your help.\nWe don’t have the backing of major investment banks and hedge funds like the ‘IN’ campaign, who are funded by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley (source: Electoral Commission).\nNor can we rely on the big donors that funded the right wing Brexit film – they don’t share our view of what Britain should look like.\nOur forward looking film about why the EU is terrible for ordinary working people, for public services, for social justice and for democracy has been made on a shoestring budget so far, but to reach the parts of the country that are ignored by the mainstream media, to present a film of good quality for public consumption, and to promote the film to as wide an audience as possible, we need your help.\nWe could create a much more just and equal society out of the EU, but it can only happen if enough left wing voters vote to Leave on the 23rd June.\nWe believe that £15k would enable our small crew to finish the film we believe needs to be made in order to secure a leave vote on 23rd June.\nWhy would the left oppose the EU?\nThe EU Commission that makes EU law is unelected. The EU parliament has no real power. Power is with the Commission. We believe that to protect the interests of working people, history has shown that the ballot box is the central way to help ordinary people and keep the powerful in check.\n– The EU is enforcing the privatisation of the railways across the EU by 2019 under its Fourth Railway Package. Any hopes British people had of ending the disgrace of privatised rail and its extreme profiteering has now been wiped out by the EU.\n– TTIP. The scariest thing that most people have never heard of. We need to change that. TTIP is a huge trade deal between the US and the EU, negotiated in total secrecy, that will open up Britain, including the NHS, to rapacious US corporations. There’s a reason the deal is being done in secret – it completely shafts the European people for the benefit of multinationals and banks. People who do know about TTIP are utterly outraged by it, across Europe.\n– Postal services: like rail, EU legislation now means all across Europe postal services will be fully “open to competition”. Renationalising Royal Mail? Forget it.\n– Greece and the euro crisis. This has shown the EU up for what it is. A bully which will ignore legislation, treaties, elections, anything that gets in the way of what it wants, and what the banks want. Make no mistake, the “Greek bailout” was a bank bailout – that you paid for. Greece has been totally crushed by the EU in the most ruthless manner. We don’t think the EU is a “friend of working people”, we think the idea is obscene.\n– The EU is unstable and unpredictable. Who knows which countries will join the EU, or what issues those enlargments may cause – economically, politically, socially. Turkey’s Erdogan laughs at basic demcratic values. The EU doesn’t care at all. It just wants what it always wants: more power, more people, less democracy.\n– The Euro will almost certaily collapse. It’s a question of when, not if. And the fallout will be mayhem. Remember, the same people telling you how awful Bexit would be said exactly the same things, almost word for word, when they were threatening us with the consequences of not joining the disastrous single currency.\n– Ultimately, ordinary people have the lives, liberties and rights they do today because they fought for and won the vote. We don’t believe anyone should forfeit that right. We don’t think people should trust their fate to powerful people who have never faced an election, and never will. History tells us it is complete madness to do so.\n– Vote leave, and let’s build a fair Britain that works for all. Millions of people across Europe are absolutely behind us on this, and they’re not going anywhere. Britain will always be in Europe. But we should be out of the EU.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_child-rapist-was-allowed-public-access-to-children/content_1002.html": "The Cyprus Mail reported:\nA convicted child rapist has been allowed to take children on horse and carriage rides along the Paphos coast and in Peyia since 2014 because a series of legal loopholes meant he did not need a police clearance certificate to obtain the necessary licence. The man was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2006 after being found guilty of the sexual abuse and rape of a 14-year-old girl in 2005, and to 2.5 years a year later after being found guilty of the sexual abuse and the attempted rape of another girl, also 14, between 2002 and 2003.\nBut last summer he was then given a licence by Peyia municipality to transport tourists along the Coral Bay strip, and last Christmas – dressed as a Father Christmas elf – he gave festive rides to children at the Peyia Christmas Fayre. This case, according to Children’s Rights Commissioner Leda Koursoumba, is a glaring example of shortcomings in the existing law in force only since 2014 which forbids those convicted of child sexual abuse, exploitation and offences concerning child pornography to hold jobs that have to do with children.\nBut the current law is not retroactive. The ban does not cover those sentenced before 2014, Koursoumba said, highlighting the gap in the law and the national strategy to fight sexual abuse and exploitation of children. “If everyone’s wish is the wellbeing of children, they ought to be amended,” Koursoumba told the Sunday Mail. The law, she said, needs to be amended so that it covers those convicted before 2014, “for the protection of the children”.\nYet another legislative loophole meant that in neither Paphos nor Peyia did the convicted child abuser have to provide a clean criminal record from the police to obtain his local authority licence. At present, those wishing to offer horse carriage services must obtain what is known as a street vendor permit from the local government. To issue such a licence, no clean criminal record is necessary.\nPeyia mayor, Marinos Lambrou, told the Sunday Mail, he had no idea of the man’s past but that he had been given a permit to carry tourists in his horse and carriage after presenting all requested documentation. “He had all the relevant paperwork, concerning his horse and insurance coverage,” said Lambrou. He said that this concerned only a month last summer.\n“If all this is true, it is sad, and of course, we will not grant him a licence in the future without a police clearance,” Lambrou said. According to Peyia municipal secretary, Marios Matheou, the man was given a street vendor permit which expired at the end of 2018.\n“There is no provision in the law to oblige a street vendor to present a clean criminal record,” Matheou said.\nHe added that because no provisions in the law on municipalities cover a special licence for the commercial use of horse and cart, applicants obtain the same one as street vendors. A source told the Sunday Mail, that in the case of the Paphos municipality, it was actually known that the man was a convicted child rapist before he was given a licence.\nAs the municipal council members opposed to him getting a licence were outnumbered by those in favour, he was able to operate in the town’s harbour area for three years. The thinking behind the move was that he had served his sentence for his offences and was entitled to make a living, the source said, adding that the area where the carriage was operating was crowded, well-lit and had security cameras, thus eliminating possibility of misconduct.\nBut in 2017, the Sunday Mail has learned, Paphos mayor Phedonas Phedonos stepped in and refused outright to have the man’s licence renewed. But for lawyer Anastasia Papadopoulou, who is also the head of the council for the implementation of the national strategy to fight sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography, even if local authorities did not technically break the law in this case, they ought to be far more vigilant in such matters.\n“Employers must ask staff working with children to present a document that they have not been convicted of any sex offences against minors,” Papadopoulou told the Sunday Mail. Even though the man was not a local authority employee, as he was only given a licence to run his horse carriage, because he worked around children, authorities should have asked for this type of documentation she said.\n“They must be more sensitised over such issues,” she said.\nBy 2017 Paphos municipality had learned this lesson. In its call for an expression of interest for licences to horse carriage owners for 2017, it included among its stipulations a clean criminal record. Koursoumba told the Sunday Mail that the case also raises serious concerns over the vagueness of the current law listing jobs that deal with children.\n“It is clear for some professions, such as that of the teacher, but for others, such as street vendors it is not,” she said.\nThe commissioner said that a list ought to be made specifying these jobs by assessing the risk to children to make it easier for employers and members of the public. According to the 2014 law on the Prevention and Combating of Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography, the court has the power, along with the sentence to someone found guilty of such offences, to issue a decree which prohibits or terminates the employment of the convict in places frequented by children.\nThe court can also ban the convicted person from staying in the same residence as the victim or other children, or in a space adjacent to either the house of the victim or of other areas where children frequent. A lawyer told the Sunday Mail, however, that this is not that common.\nThe same law provides that persons convicted of such offences will permanently have this on their criminal record. Justice Minister, Ionas Nicolaou, said on Friday that a bill to amend the 2014 law would be presented to the cabinet on Monday for approval and sent to parliament for discussion. The bill, Nicolaou said, aims to cover gaps and omissions found in the 2014 law over the past four years.\nCOMMENT\nIt is beyond belief that this sick predator has been allowed to work with the public after raping a child. He was sentenced to NINE YEARS in prison for the rape of a FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL and then allowed to work in a situation where he could, would and has come in to contact with children.\nCyprus does not have a Sex Offender’s register, but it is long overdue, there is far too much being covered up, far too many incidents of families covering up for sex offenders in their family, or sick people like this being allowed to carry on as normal because they know the right people, this MUST STOP NOW!\nThose who cover up for paedophiles are just as guilty as the perpetrator!\nThere is a petition for a Sex Offenders Register in Cyprus that I have been more than happy to help get off the ground, if you are reading this, please sign it.

This divisive issue has ignited heated debates and sparked calls for greater transparency from governments regarding comprehensive data on the subject.\nAt the heart of this controversy lies a particularly distressing case involving Obert Moyo, an illegal immigrant from Zimbabwe. Despite having been denied asylum and possessing a chequered history of violent offences – including a 14-year prison sentence for brutally assaulting a former partner – Moyo was inexplicably released on a prison license. Tragically, this decision had devastating consequences, as Moyo went on to viciously murder a 35-year-old woman with whom he was in a relationship, chasing her down the street and stabbing her to death in a horrific act of violence.\nDisturbing Patterns Emerging Across Europe\nWhile the British government remains stubbornly tight-lipped on the subject, statistics from other European nations paint an increasingly concerning picture. In the French capital of Paris, a staggering 77% of solved rape cases in 2022 were reportedly committed by foreign nationals, with many of these incidents targeting vulnerable tourists in popular hotspots.\nThe situation in Denmark is equally alarming, with government data revealing that non-European first-generation migrants are a staggering 279 times more likely to commit murder, 464 times more likely to commit rape, and 20% more likely to commit assault compared to native-born Danes. These figures have sent shockwaves through Danish society and ignited a heated debate surrounding immigration policies and public safety.\nThe Government’s Deafening Silence\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information requests and offers to pay for the data, the British Ministry of Justice has stubbornly refused to disclose crucial information on the number of foreign nationals committing violent crimes within the United Kingdom. This has fueled suspicions that the government is reluctant to confront an uncomfortable reality that could potentially challenge existing policies and spark widespread public outrage.\nCritics argue that by obscuring these statistics, the authorities are effectively turning a blind eye to a pressing issue that may be putting the lives and well-being of British citizens at risk. They contend that only by shining a light on the unvarnished truth can effective solutions be crafted and implemented.\nA Broader Perspective on Violence Against Women\nWhile the focus on foreign nationals and violent crime is undoubtedly a legitimate concern, it is essential to maintain a balanced and nuanced approach to this multifaceted issue. Commentators have rightly pointed out that discussions surrounding sexual violence against women have been largely absent from mainstream discourse until the issue involved a specific demographic group.\nThey emphasise that a staggering one in four women in the UK have been sexually assaulted or raped, with the overwhelming majority of these crimes being committed by men, regardless of their background or nationality. This sobering statistic highlights the urgent need to address the broader societal issues contributing to violence against women, rather than solely fixating on the nationality or cultural factors of the perpetrators.\nA Call for Transparent and Comprehensive Data\nAdvocates for transparency have called for the release of comprehensive data, emphasising the paramount importance of following the truth wherever it may lead. They acknowledge the potential discomfort that such information might cause, but argue vehemently that discomfort should never be a justification for withholding crucial facts from the public eye.\nValid points have also been raised about the necessity of differentiating between various categories of foreign nationals, such as asylum seekers, those with pending visa applications, and foreign tourists. Each of these groups, it is contended, may present unique challenges and require tailored policy responses to effectively address the specific issues they face or pose.\nIntersecting Factors and Nuanced Analysis\nExperts have highlighted the inherent complexity of the issue, suggesting that factors such as poverty and specific nationalities might play a significant role in the observed trends. They advocate for a thorough and nuanced analysis that cross-references variables like race, socioeconomic status, and country of origin to identify potential patterns and inform targeted, evidence-based policies.\nThe importance of considering the demographics of victims has also been emphasised, with arguments made that if the majority of victims are white women or native to a particular European country, it could lend further weight to the argument for reevaluating immigration policies. This, it is contended, could help prioritise the safety and well-being of women already residing in these nations, who may be disproportionately vulnerable to certain forms of violence.\nThe Perils of Oversimplification and Divisive Rhetoric\nWhile the statistics emerging from nations like France and Denmark are undeniably alarming, it is crucial to approach this sensitive topic with caution, nuance, and compassion. Sweeping generalisations and inflammatory rhetoric must be avoided at all costs, as they can further divide communities, exacerbate existing tensions, and ultimately hinder progress towards effective solutions.\nKnee-jerk reactions and draconian measures borne of fear and anger are rarely conducive to positive change. Instead, a measured and evidence-based approach, grounded in open and honest dialogue, is essential to upholding the safety and well-being of all citizens, regardless of their background or demographic.\nStriking a Balance: Security and Humanity\nUndoubtedly, the protection of citizens from violent crime should be a paramount priority for any government. However, this pursuit of security must be balanced with a commitment to upholding human rights, promoting social cohesion, and fostering an environment of mutual understanding and respect.\nBy embracing transparency, accountability, and empathy, policymakers and society can work collaboratively towards effective solutions that address the root causes of violence, rather than merely treating the symptoms. This may involve addressing socioeconomic disparities, investing in education and community outreach programs, and promoting cultural integration and tolerance.\nUltimately, the goal should be to create a society where no individual or community is left vulnerable or marginalised, and where the fundamental rights and dignities of all people are protected and upheld, regardless of their origins or circumstances.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_investigations-continue-into-identity-of-body-found-in-mine/content_589.html": "Police are continuing investigations into the identity of a woman whose body was found tied up and wrapped in a sheet in an abandoned mine near Mitsero at around 3pm on Sunday. The body, which was badly decomposed, was found by a German photographer who was taking pictures in the area which he visited often.\nThe dead woman was retrieved from a shaft at a depth of 15 to 20 metres at 8.30pm by fire services and police.\nPolice are looking at all possibilities, including murder, police spokesman Andreas Angelides said on Monday. They are checking their register of missing people to see whether there is a possible match. Officers are also questioning residents near the mine. The post mortem, carried out by state pathologists Sofocles Sofocleous and Nicolas Charalambous, on Monday morning did not shed light on the cause of the woman’s death although it was reported that no stab wounds or gun injuries were found. Tissue was sent for histopathological and other tests.\nThe pathologists did not say how long they thought the body had been at the mine. Authorities are also trying to determine whether she was alive or dead when she was thrown into the mine shaft. According to state radio, she was 1.60 to 1.65 metres tall and probably Asian.\n“From the findings at the scene, we are examining the possibility of a criminal act,” Angelides said.\nHe said that the first thing was to identify the woman as well as going through the registry of missing persons, adding she may not have been reported as missing. According to state broadcaster CyBC, police said there are 32 unsolved cases concerning persons reported as missing dating as far back as 1990, including Asian persons.\n“We will look into everything concerning this case,” Angelides said.\nAlthough he admitted he is not involved in the case, former state pathologist Marios Matsakis told media on Monday morning that it looked like a case of callous murder that was reminiscent of a previous case where the body of a woman was found down a well.\n“There is no doubt that this is a callous murder. It will be a difficult forensic investigation because of the body’s decay,” he said.\nMatsakis said it reminded him of the Oxana Lisna case 25 years ago.\n“That was a double murder, the body of one woman was found in Kotsiatis [rubbish dump], while that of Lisna was found in a well. The murderers are now in prison,” he said.\nAntonis Kitas, known as Al Capone, and Michalsi Iacovides were convicted in 1994 for the rape and murders of Ukrainian artiste Lisna, 20, and Swedish housewife Christina Ahfeldt, 28. Lisna’s battered body was discovered down a well near Livadia village, Larnaca, while Ahfeldt’s corpse was unearthed at Kotsiatis rubbish tip outside Nicosia. Both young women had been abducted, beaten and sexually assaulted before being murdered and dumped in the summer of 1993.\nAl Capone and Iacovides are serving life sentences for the killings. Matsakis said the findings on Sunday’s discovery will depend on the way she was murdered. There is a procedure usually followed in such cases to rule out everything, he said.\n“I wish for the cause of death to be determined and that the cold-blood murderers are found.”",

Athienou is one of only four villages located within the United Nations Buffer Zone, the other three being Pyla, Troulloi and Deneia.\nAthienou has been inhabited since the Neolithic period, and is the continuation of the ancient city-kingdom of Golgoi.\nThe village has a rich wheat growing and bread-making history, and is famous for its delicious traditional bread – known locally as ‘Athienitiko’ which visitors can watch being made – and its pastries, as well as its dairy products, which visitors can watch being made. It also has its own special handmade lace techniques known as ‘Venis’ lace (or ‘pittotes’) and Athienou Lace (known as ‘oloplouma’). These differ from Lefkara lace linens (known as Lefkaritika) and are made exclusively in Athienou. The lace craft has been recognised as part of the village’s unique heritage and added to the UNESCO National Intangible Cultural Heritage List. Click here to see the video of the creation of the Exhibition “Seven Stories. Lace and Modern Art”\nAthienou is famous for its bread, known as ‘Athienitiko’\nOther interesting sights include the archaeological site of Athienou-Malloura, the Kallinikeio Municipal Museum (which also exhibits finds from the Malloura site), and several old, restored buildings – including a traditional flourmill, which now serves as a museum of the traditional methods of flour production.\nAthienou’s churches of Panagia Chryseleoussa, Agios Fokas and Agios Georgios are particularly notable for their historically significant icons and frescoes.\nAthienou is encircled by the buffer zone, in a cresent shape ironically, leaving it somewhat isolated. It used to be just 10/12 Km from Nicosia, but since 1974, the journey to Nicosia involves driving south, half way to Larnaca, across, past Dali and then back, making it 2/3 times the distance. However there is strong support for a crossing at Piroi, which would be wonderful for the village.",

If you find yourself in this situation, it’s essential to take action and ensure your safety. One powerful tool at your disposal is Claire’s Law, a domestic violence disclosure scheme that empowers individuals to seek information from the police if they have concerns about their partner or ex-partner. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Claire’s Law is, how to use it, and what steps to take if you’re worried about your safety.\nUnderstanding Claire’s Law:\nClaire’s Law, officially known as the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, allows individuals to request information from the police concerning their partner’s history of violence or abuse. This initiative is designed to protect potential victims by providing them with crucial information about their partner’s past actions.\nHow to Use Claire’s Law:\nIf you believe that your partner’s behavior raises concerns or you know someone in a similar situation, you can take the following steps to access information through Claire’s Law:\n1. **Contact the Police:** Reach out to your local police force. You can visit the police station in person, call 101, or check if your police force offers an online form or email service for disclosure requests. Don’t hesitate to ask a friend or family member for support during this process.\n2. **Request Assistance:** If you’re unsure about how to initiate the process, you can ask someone, like a friend or a domestic violence support professional, to help you with the initial steps.\nWhat Happens Next:\nOnce you’ve contacted the police and expressed your concerns, they will proceed as follows:\n1. **Initial Questions:** The police will ask you questions about your partner to better understand your concerns and assess the situation.\n2. **Evaluation:** After gathering information, the police will hold a meeting to determine what information can be disclosed to you.\n3. **Notification:** A representative from the police will contact you to inform you if they have found any relevant information about your partner. Please note that this process may take up to 35 days.\n4. **Safety Measures:** If you’re worried about your safety during this waiting period, don’t hesitate to call 999 for immediate assistance.\nInformation Delivery:\nThe information about your partner’s history can be provided to you in various ways, depending on your preference and safety concerns. It can be shared in person at the police station, in your home, or over the phone.\nSeeking Additional Support:\nIf you’re feeling unsafe or uncertain about your situation, remember that you are not alone. Several organizations offer support and resources for individuals facing domestic violence or abuse:\n– **Women’s Aid:** A leading charity providing assistance to victims of domestic abuse.\n– **National Domestic Abuse Helpline:** A 24/7 helpline offering guidance and support.\n– **Refuge:** A charity providing safe housing and support for those experiencing domestic violence.\n– **Sister Space:** An organization dedicated to helping Black women affected by domestic violence.\nConclusion:\nClaire’s Law, the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, can be a lifeline for individuals worried about their partner’s behavior. If something doesn’t feel right in your relationship, it’s crucial to take action and seek the information and support you need to ensure your safety and well-being. Remember that you don’t have to face this challenge alone; there are organizations and professionals ready to help you navigate this difficult situation.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_kidnapping-defendant-admits-giving-boys-sedatives/content_598.html": "The Cyprus Mail reported…………\nThe man who admitted kidnapping two boys from their Larnaca primary school in September pleaded guilty on Wednesday to two charges of giving them sedatives. Giorgos Nicolaou, 35, alias George, had pleaded guilty to kidnapping the boys back in November last year but denied administering Lorazepam to either of them.\nOn Wednesday, Nicolaou changed his plea and the court adjourned until February 1 when prosecutors will present the case. The court also instructed the welfare office to prepare a report on the defendant’s conditions.\nHe will remain in custody until then.\nNicolaou was arrested at his flat in the Kamares area of Larnaca around seven hours after the boys went missing from school early in the morning on September 25. He had pretended to be a new teacher at the school and asked a group of boys for help to carry some books. The two boys, who were friends, volunteered and apparently followed him to his flat.\nThe children were found unharmed but dazed and confused at around 3pm. It later emerged that they had been given sedatives in lemonade to keep them quiet. Police said they found nothing incriminating on a computer found at the suspect’s flat. The ease with which the defendant managed to take the boys sparked a big debate about security, prompting authorities to announced strict measures, including high fences and guards.\nCOMMENT\nThis is a clear indication firstly of Police negligence, there is NO WAY that a paedophile gets to middle age without being known to the police. I am convinced and the evidence of my research indicates that he was not only known to the police, but they were also aware that he had made two previous attempts to abduct children in the preceding few days.\nDue to their negligence, these boys were in the clutches of this monster for seven or eight hours! This report states that the children were unharmed, really? They were sedated, in his bed, one was released from hospital the next day, and the other was kept for a few more days…….why?\nThere is no sex offender’s register in Cyprus, no equivalent of Sarah’s law, too much negligence, too much is covered up and too many people get away with too much………this incident should be consider a matter of NATIONAL SHAME!",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_angela-rayner-plans-to-redefine-islamophobia/content_874.html": "Angela Rayner Plans To Redefine Islamophobia\nA significant political development has emerged on the front page of the Telegraph, revealing Angela Rayner’s plans to establish new regulatory frameworks concerning Islam and Free Speech in Britain. The proposal centres on creating a comprehensive definition of Islamophobia, with Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative Attorney General and notable Remainer, being recommended to chair a newly formed 16-member council. This initiative has sparked considerable controversy among political observers and civil rights advocates, who view it as an indirect attempt to introduce blasphemy laws into British legislation—a move that fundamentally contradicts the nation’s long-standing traditions of free expression and secular governance.\nThe timing and nature of this proposal have raised eyebrows across the political spectrum, with critics arguing that it represents a concerning pattern of increasing state intervention in public discourse. This development appears to follow a trajectory that began during the COVID-19 pandemic, where emergency measures significantly expanded government authority over daily life. Political analysts note that such expansions of state power rarely prove temporary, as governments typically demonstrate reluctance to relinquish new controls once established. The Labour Party’s initiative appears to many as an opportunistic move to cement additional oversight over public discourse and social interaction.\nThe proposal has drawn particular attention to Angela Rayner’s political evolution and current positioning. Her background as a key ally during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour Party provides important context for understanding her current policy initiatives. Political observers suggest that her recent proposals align closely with the left-wing ideology that characterised the Corbyn era, despite Labour’s public attempts to distance itself from that period under Keir Starmer’s leadership.\nA recently published book by Sunday Times journalists has provided unprecedented insight into the internal workings of the current Labour leadership, particularly regarding Keir Starmer’s management style and decision-making processes. The account details significant operational dysfunction, notably the strained relationship between Sue Gray and Morgan McSweeney, which became so untenable that they required separate working spaces. The book reveals concerning gaps in Labour’s preparation for government, including an apparent lack of concrete planning for their first hundred days in office—traditionally considered a crucial period for any new administration.\nThe investigation into Labour’s shadow cabinet has revealed what many consider to be a concerning lack of real-world experience among its members. Unlike previous opposition frontbenches, the current team appears to have limited experience outside the political sphere, particularly in business and industry. This has led to criticism that their policy proposals often reflect academic theories rather than practical solutions to real-world challenges. The contrast with other successful political operations globally has been particularly stark, with observers noting the absence of individuals with substantial private sector or industrial expertise.\nStarmer’s public appearances have increasingly drawn criticism, particularly regarding his communication style and ability to handle pressure. A recent NATO press conference in Brussels provided a telling example, where his response to questioning about voice coaching and potential COVID rule violations displayed a notable lack of composure. The incident has raised questions about his ability to handle the intense scrutiny that comes with high-level political leadership.\nThe matter of Starmer’s voice coaching has become symbolic of broader concerns about his leadership style. Despite professional coaching, observers note that he continues to struggle with public engagement and charisma—essential qualities for effective political leadership. Political analysts suggest that the relative lack of scrutiny he faced during the Conservative Party’s period of internal turmoil may have left these issues unaddressed for too long.\nLabour’s current positioning raises significant questions about its traditional role as the party of working-class interests. Critics argue that the current leadership appears more comfortable in international diplomatic settings than engaging with domestic constituencies. This disconnect is particularly evident in their approach to educational and social mobility issues, with concerning statistics about educational outcomes for white British boys being notably absent from party messaging and policy priorities.\nThe party’s economic vision has also come under increased scrutiny, particularly regarding its approach to international trade and relations with the European Union. Starmer’s recent overtures to Brussels have been questioned, given the current economic challenges facing many EU member states. Germany’s economic difficulties, described as the most severe since reunification, raise questions about the wisdom of prioritising closer EU alignment over exploring opportunities in more dynamic global markets.\nThe handling of Britain’s energy policy has emerged as another point of contention, with critics arguing that Labour’s approach fails to balance environmental concerns with economic realities. The role of traditional energy sources in Britain’s industrial development and current economy appears to be undervalued in Labour’s policy proposals, leading to concerns about the practical implications of their green energy initiatives.\nThe party’s internal culture has also come under scrutiny, with reports suggesting a concerning disconnect between the leadership’s metropolitan outlook and the practical concerns of traditional Labour voters. This cultural divide is reflected in policy priorities, communication strategies, and the party’s overall approach to national identity and heritage.\nThe response to international criticism, particularly from figures like Emmanuel Macron, has raised questions about Labour’s diplomatic stance. The perceived reluctance to robustly defend British interests in the face of critical comments from European leaders has led to discussions about the party’s commitment to national interests versus international relationships.\nThe broader context of global economic opportunities presents a stark contrast to Labour’s European focus. While the party leadership concentrates on EU relations, significant economic growth in regions such as Asia, Africa, and the Americas suggests potential alternative paths for British international engagement and trade development.\nThese developments collectively paint a picture of a party at a crossroads, struggling to balance traditional Labour values with contemporary political challenges. The tension between metropolitan liberal values and traditional working-class interests, combined with questions about leadership capability and policy coherence, suggests significant challenges ahead for Labour’s political project.\nSummary\n• Angela Rayner has proposed new rules on Islam and Free Speech, including plans to create a definition of Islamophobia through a 16-member council chaired by Dominic Grieve. Critics view this as a potential “blasphemy law by the back door.”\n• The proposal is seen as part of a broader pattern of increasing state control over public discourse, following the expansion of government powers during COVID lockdowns.\n• A new book by Sunday Times journalists reveals internal Labour Party dysfunction:\n– Significant tensions between Sue Gray and Morgan McSweeney\n– Limited preparation for potential government transition\n– Keir Starmer portrayed as indecisive and easily swayed by advisers\n• Concerns about Labour’s Shadow Cabinet include:\n– Perceived lack of business experience and real-world expertise\n– Policies criticized as too academic rather than practical\n– Questions about overall competence and leadership capabilities\n• Starmer’s leadership style has faced criticism:\n– Poor handling of media questioning, particularly about his voice coach\n– Lack of charisma despite professional coaching\n– Described by insiders as an “HR Manager” and compared unfavorably to past Labour leaders\n• Labour’s relationship with working-class voters is under scrutiny:\n– Perceived disconnect between leadership and traditional Labour constituencies\n– Limited focus on critical issues like declining educational outcomes for white British boys\n– Leadership appears more comfortable in international settings than domestic engagement\n• Questions about Labour’s international approach:\n– Heavy focus on EU relations despite economic challenges in European economies\n– Criticism of Starmer’s response to Macron’s Brexit comments\n– Potential missed opportunities in other global markets (US, Asia, Africa)\n• The party faces broader challenges:\n– Balancing metropolitan liberal values with traditional working-class interests\n– Developing coherent policies that address practical concerns\n– Maintaining credibility while pursuing controversial social policies",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-paradox-of-democracy-and-individualism-2/content_328.html": "The Paradox of Democracy and Individualism\n“What exactly is the paradox between democracy and individualism? When we are presented with anything to do with social structure or politics, it is always presented to us along linear lines: left-wing, right-wing, collectivism, individualism, socialism, capitalism, and so forth. However, in my opinion, the more I looked into this, the more I realized that this was not just an illusion but a form of trickery to distract us from what is really happening.\nThe reality, as I see it, is that political structures are not based along linear extremes but more along overlapping circles that move around like positively charged ions. The one that has the greatest energy and force is the one that will have the greatest influence upon us. But what’s the difference? The difference is that while our attention is focused at one extreme or the other because that’s where we have been encouraged and manipulated to look, we miss what’s happening before our very eyes.\nAs Aldous Huxley documented in his book “Brave New World,” how do you control the masses? He once said that for a totalitarian structure to work, there must be a degree of compliance from the oppressed people because when people are pushed beyond a certain point where they do not fear the option, albeit death, they become the greatest threat of all. We’ve seen that in uprisings throughout history: Boudicca, Spartacus, the Zanji Rebellion where over 500,000 African slaves rebelled against the caliphate, the Bolsheviks, and so on and so forth. When people are pushed beyond a certain point, they have nothing to lose.\nHowever, as Aldous Huxley documented in “Brave New World,” when you allow people to overdose on that which they want the most and you allow them to desensitize themselves by themselves, you destroy society, and you can easily manipulate that society. And just as Aldous Huxley preceded George Orwell with “1984,” so his vision of “Brave New World” and a world of hedonism preceded the world of totalitarianism.\nIn the meantime, we are presented with the aspiration for law and order and democracy. However, the reality is that we are gradually being drip-fed engineered social chaos behind the scenes. An entire army of young, disrespectful, rebellious, undisciplined young people who have been inflamed with entitlement are causing havoc within our cities, presenting us with the illusion that we are on a slippery slope to social chaos and that we are on the slippery slope to lawlessness.\nHowever, in parallel, we are living in the most totalitarianist times in the Free World. This is yet another example of manipulation on the grander scale because just as these youngsters have been inflamed and unleashed upon us with malice aforethought and an agenda, the same pattern will follow: create the problem, terrify the nation, offer a solution. And that solution, I assure you, is not one that were we to know it in advance that any of us would agree to.\nThis is why we are denied democracy in its purest and absolute form. No one person can be trusted to have absolute power because that is the very nature of humanity. No one person should not be accountable to the people and the masses, despite how they are portrayed in the media, despite the way that people who feel that the masses have voted or their opinion. It is only the masses who can keep those who are in control grounded, and that is why they must always answer directly to the people. That is not what is happening now. As we’ve seen just in the last year or so, the party in power removed one leader after another without the mandate of the people. In response to protests, they said on many occasions that we’re not a presidential system, we don’t vote for a prime minister, we vote for a candidate.\nBut who is it who is paraded in front of us night after night when there is an election? Who is it that will speak in an electoral broadcast before an election? It is always the prime minister or the aspiring prime minister. And yet, these people feel that they have the legal right to remove the person who we elected, to ignore the wishes of the people, and enforce their will. And then, make a few changes like this joke speech about Net Zero from Fishy Rishi this week, just a week or two after he presided over the energy bill where you and I can go to prison for not keeping in line with their Net Zero targets. If he were genuine, he would not have presented this bill to the House of Lords; he would have kicked it out. None of them can be trusted.\nThe only way that society can protect itself from this blatant, arrogant authoritarianism that is heading our way is to demand democracy and to have MPs, local candidates who are answerable to the people. And the people, in turn, must step up and ensure that they answer to them. They must not be placated with cynical token gestures. I hope this makes sense to you. Thank you very much. See you next time. Bye-bye for now.”",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_married-womens-property-act-1882/content_788.html": "Married Women’s Property Act 1882\nJust a few weeks ago, the UK seemed to have missed one of the most important milestones in the journey of women in this country and indeed, around the world. I had this date noted a long time ago and I assumed that I would be reminded by the mass media coverage of such an important date, but I did not see anything and it was by pure chance that I happen to come across something that just remined me.\nHow far have we come?\nWe have come such a long way in just one and a half centuries, as this was followed by women succeeding in achieving the right to vote in 1928, which is less than a century ago! Since then, we have finally seen the emancipation of women, throughout the western world, domestically, politically, commercially and socially, but before we congratulate ourselves with a public back-patting event, we also have a long, long way to go.\nDespite the fact that we have finally reached a point where positive discrimination is no longer necessary, as we are now at the stage where we have had women succeed and fail in all walks of life, therefore, for the main part, we may have almost reached the point where most situations are simply about the best person for the job\nWhere are we actually failing?\nSince the 1908s, when the honourable cause for women, is alleged to have been hijacked by what is referred to as ‘Third Wave Feminism’ the struggle took on a different tone, one which has been mired in hostility and misandry.\nHas this helped women? It could be argued that it has actually had the opposite effect.\n“It could be argued, that in our quest to achieve rights for women, society has negated to seek respect for women!”\nWe need only research the social consequences of the dramatic changes in the last few decades, as women have successfully achieved the ability to succeed, it seems that men have in parallel, ‘absolved’ themselves from responsibility, to women, marriage, relationships and life in general.\nI appreciate that this is a sweeping statement and I am not generalising here, I am referring to the number of men who are giving up on relationships and almost withdrawing from responsibility and life in general. At the same time, women are working harder than ever, taking on more than ever, but simultaneously dealing with the practicality of being women, be that physical, emotional or maternal. The result? It could be argued that in some way, life for women could be deemed to be harder than ever.\nThen there was a sinister turn for the worse\nOver the last decade or two, there has been an explosion of porn available online, but this is not simply saucy material for adult pleasure, much of it is not just aggressive, it is violent, degrading and nurturing an entire generation of closet misogynists.\nThe incidence of indecent assault, rapes and even violent attacks is higher than ever, but now we have an even more terrifying method of female degradation, ‘Deep Fake Porn’\nThis is computer generated pornography, where the image of a woman is taken, perhaps from her social medial profile, or even live footage from a zoom meeting and thanks to some very clever software that is available to everyone, even on mobile phones, the victim’s face can be transposed in to the video and in minutes, an unsuspecting woman can be featured in a porn video made with her as the centre stage. This then makes its way online where it will be available for ever, there is no return from that point.\nThe most terrifying fact is that this is NOT ILLEGAL!\nI will be going in to this in greater detail in a future post, but for the time being, we should at least celebrate the first and most important milestone that began dismantle the wall of misogyny, setting women free from enslavement.\nHere is the full text of the act.\n1882 CHAPTER 75\nAn Act to consolidate and amend the Acts relating to the Property of Married Women.\n[18th August 1882]\nBe it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :\n1Married woman to be capable of holding property and of contracting as a feme sole\n(1)A married woman shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, be capable of acquiring, holding, and disposing by will or otherwise, of any real or personal property as her separate property, in the same manner as if she were a feme sole, without the intervention of any trustee.\n(2)A married woman shall be capable of entering into and rendering herself liable in respect of and to the extent of her separate property on any contract, and of suing and being sued, either in contract or in tort, or otherwise, in all respects as if she were a feme sole, and her husband need not be joined with her as plaintiff or defendant, or be made a party to any action or other legal proceeding brought by or taken against her; and any damages or costs recovered by her in any such action or proceeding shall be her separate property ; and any damages or costs recovered against her in any such action or

and in any such action against husband and wife jointly, if it appears that the husband is liable for the debt or damages recovered, or any part thereof, the judgment to the extent of the amount for which the husband is liable shall be a joint judgment against the husband personally and against the wife as to her separate property;

and any order of a county or civil bill court under the provisions of this section shall be subject to appeal in the same way as any other order made by the same court would be, and all proceedings in a county court or civil bill court under this section in which, by reason of the value of the property in dispute, such court would not have had jurisdiction if this Act or the Married Women’s Property Act, 1870, had not passed, may, at the option of the defendant or respondent to such proceedings, be removed as of right into the High Court of Justice in England or Ireland (as the case may be) by writ of certiorari or otherwise as may be prescribed by any rule of such High Court;

but no restriction against anticipation contained in any settlement or agreement for a settlement of a woman’s own property to be made or entered into by herself shall have any validity against debts contracted by her before marriage, and no settlement or agreement for a settlement shall have any greater force or validity against creditors of such woman than a like settlement or agreement for a settlement made or entered into by a man would have against his creditors.\n20Married woman to be liable to the parish for the maintenance of her husband\nWhere in England the husband of any woman having separate property becomes chargeable to any union or parish, the justices having jurisdiction in such union or parish may, in petty sessions assembled, upon application of the guardians of the poor, issue a summons against the wife, and make and enforce such order against her for the maintenance of her husband out of such separate property as by the thirty-third section of the [31 & 32 Vict. c. 122.] Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868, they may now make and enforce against a husband for the maintenance of his wife if she becomes chargeable to any union or parish. Where in Ireland relief is given under the provisions of the Acts relating to the relief of the destitute poor to the husband of any woman having separate property, the cost price of such relief is hereby declared to be a loan from the guardians of the union in which the same shall be given, and shall be recoverable from such woman as if she were a feme sole by the same actions and proceedings as money lent.\n21Married woman to be liable to the parish for the maintenance of her children\nA married woman having separate property shall be subject to all such liability for the maintenance of her children and grandchildren as the husband is now by law subject to for the maintenance of her children and grandchildren : Provided always, that nothing in this Act shall relieve her husband from any liability imposed upon him by law to maintain her children or grandchildren.\n22Repeal of 33 & 34 Vict. c. 93; 37 & 38 Vict. c. 50\nThe Married Women’s Property Act, 1870, and the [37 & 38 Vict. c. 50.] Married Women’s Property Act, 1870, Amendment Act, 1874, are hereby repealed: Provided that such repeal shall not affect any act done or right acquired while either of such Acts was in force, or any right or liability of any husband or wife, married before the commencement of this Act, to sue or be sued under the provisions of the said repealed Acts or either of them, for or in respect of any debt, contract, wrong, or other matter or thing whatsoever, for or in respect of which any such right or liability shall have accrued to or against such husband or wife before the commencement of this Act.\n23Legal representative of married woman\nFor the purposes of this Act the legal personal representative of any married woman shall in respect of her separate estate have the same rights and liabilities and be subject to the same jurisdiction as she would be if she were living.\n24Interpretation of terms\nThe word ” contract ” in this Act shall include the acceptance of any trust, or of the office of executrix or administratrix, and the provisions of this Act as to liabilities of married women shall extend to all liabilities by reason of any breach of trust or devastavit committed by any married woman being a trustee or executrix or administratrix either before or after her marriage, and her husband shall not be subject to such liabilities unless he has acted or intermeddled in the trust or administration.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-isaac-komnenos/content_162.html": "Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus\nIsaac Komnenos or Comnenus (Greek: Ἰσαάκιος Κομνηνός, romanized: Isaakios Komnēnos; c. 1155 – 1195/1196), ruled Cyprus from 1184 to 1191, before Richard the Lionheart, King of England conquered the island during the Third Crusade.\nFamily\nAt the death of Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos in 1143, the throne passed not to his third and oldest living son, Isaac Komnenos, but his youngest son, Manuel I Komnenos, who successfully claimed the throne. Isaac nevertheless served amiably as sebastokrator, and his first wife Theodora Kamaterina (d. 1144) bore him a daughter, Irene Komnene, and other children. Irene Komnene married an unnamed Doukas Kamateros and gave birth to Isaac Komnenos, a minor member of the Komnenos family, c. 1155.\nByzantine historian Niketas Choniates provides most of the following account of his life. Isaac was the son of an unnamed member of the noble Byzantine family, Doukas Kamateros and Eirene Komnene, daughter of Isaac Komnenos.\nGovernor and prison\nIsaac Komnenos married an Armenian princess on Cyprus. Emperor Manuel I Komnenos made Isaac governor of Isauria and the town of Tarsus (now in Mersin), where he started a war against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, soldiers of which captured him. As Emperor Manuel died in 1180, seemingly nobody greatly cared about the fate of Isaac, whose long imprisonment seemingly failed to improve his general disposition. On account of his Armenian royal wife, he perhaps endured not too harsh terms of captivity.\n“He presented falsified imperial letters that ordered the local administration to obey him in everything and established himself as ruler of the island.”\nFinally his aunt Theodora Komnene, queen consort of Jerusalem, during an affair with the new Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (1183–1185), convinced the Emperor to contribute to his ransom. Constantine Makrodoukas, a loyal supporter of the emperor and uncle of Isaac, and Andronikos Doukas, a relative, childhood friend, sodomite, and debaucher, both contributed to his ransom. These two relatives personally stood surety for the fealty of Isaac Komnenos to the Byzantine emperor. The Knights Templar, whom Niketas Choniates labels “the Phreri,” strangely enough contributed as well.\nFrom prison to Cyprus\nThe Armenians in 1185 released Isaac, clearly tired of the imperial service. He used the rest of the money to hire a troop of mercenaries and sailed to Cyprus. He presented falsified imperial letters that ordered the local administration to obey him in everything and established himself as ruler of the island. He created an independent patriarch of Cyprus, who crowned him as emperor in 1185.\nBecause Isaac Komnenos failed to return to imperial service, Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos ordered Constantine Makrodoukas and Andronikos Doukas arrested for treason, although Constantine had heretofore loyally supported the emperor. The courtier Stephen Hagiochristophorites conducted a water-oracle that gave the letter I (iota) as the initial of the succeeding emperor, so Byzantine emperor Andronikos I feared an attempt of Isaac to usurp the throne. When court officials led the prisoners from prison to face the charges, Hagiochristophorites started to stone them and forced others to join him. Stones impaled both prisoners at the front of the palace of Mangana (Constantinople) on 30 May 1185.\nAnother oracle gave the date of the start of the rule of the next Byzantine emperor, a time much too near then for Isaac to make the crossing from Cyprus, which greatly relieved Byzantine emperor Andronikos I.\nMeanwhile, Isaac took many other Romans into his service. He created an independent patriarch of Cyprus, who crowned him as emperor in 1185.\nAfter a popular uprising at Constantinople led to the death of the Byzantine emperor on 12 September 1185, Isaac II Angelos succeeded to the Byzantine throne. He raised a fleet of 70 ships to take back Cyprus. The fleet was under the command of John Kontostephanos and Alexios Komnenos (died 1188), a nephew once removed of the emperor. Andronikos I Komnenos ordered Alexios blinded; neither he nor quite old John seemingly fit the role particularly well.\nThe fleet landed in Cyprus, but after the troops left the ships, Margaritus of Brindisi, a pirate in the service of King William II of Sicily the Good captured the ships. Isaac or more likely Margaritus won a victory over the Byzantine troops and captured the captains, whom he took to Sicily, while the rest of the sailors on Cyprus tried their best to survive and to fend off the enemy.\n“Only much later did they return home, if they had not perished altogether.”\nRule of Cyprus\nFrom the time of his coronation, Isaac quickly started to plunder Cyprus, raping women, defiling virgins, imposing overly cruel punishments for crimes, and stealing the possessions of the citizens. “Cypriots of high esteem, comparable to Job in riches now were seen begging in the streets, naked and hungry, if they were not put to the sword by this irascible tyrant.” Furthermore, he despicably ordered the foot of Basil Pentakenos, his old teacher, hacked and amputated.\n“Isaac made an alliance with Saladin to fend off the Byzantine Emperor!”\nNiketas Choniates, clearly not very partial to Isaac, describes him as an irascible and violent man, “boiling with anger like a kettle on the fire.” Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos nevertheless bore responsibility for greater cruelties. A seeming league with William II of Sicily, a powerful thorn in the side of the Byzantine Empire, helped Isaac to hold the island for the duration of his reign, and he was also closely connected to Saladin, sultan of Egypt and Syria.\nThird Crusade\nKing Richard the Lionheart and others embarked on the Third Crusade in 1189. Early in 1191, Berengaria of Navarre and Joan of England, the fiancée and sister of King Richard, travelled together and were shipwrecked on Cyprus; Isaac Komnenos then took them captive. In retaliation, King Richard conquered the island while on his way to Tyre. The English took Isaac prisoner near Cape Apostolos Andreas on the Karpass Peninsula, the northernmost tip of the island. According to tradition, as Richard had promised not to put him into irons, he kept Isaac prisoner in chains of silver. The English transferred Isaac to the Knights Hospitaller, who kept him imprisoned in Margat near Tripoli.\nImprisonment, ransom, and death.\nReturning to Europe after the Third Crusade, King Richard was captured by Leopold V, Duke of Austria and Styria, and imprisoned by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. The subsequent ransom agreement freed Isaac and his daughter into the care of Duke Leopold, the son of Theodora Komnene, queen consort of Jerusalem and aunt of Isaac. Isaac then traveled to the Sultanate of Rum, where he attempted to gain support against the new Byzantine emperor Alexios III Angelos, crowned in 1195. However his ambitions came to nothing, as he died of poisoning in 1195 or 1196.\nHis daughter\nSources do not name the daughter of Isaac but usually call her the “Damsel of Cyprus”. Upon the deposition of her father Isaac, she joined the court of King Richard the Lionheart, and after the Third Crusade, she traveled back to England with the other ladies of his court, including Joan of England, sister of King Richard, and Berengaria of Navarre, now queen consort of England. In 1194, as part of ransom agreement of King Richard, the English released the Cypriot princess into the care of Leopold of Austria, a distant relative.\nLater she lived in Provence, where in 1199 she again encountered Joan, now married to Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse. After Joan’s death in early September 1199, Raymond married her, but the marriage was annulled probably in late 1202. In 1203 she married Thierry, an illegitimate son of Baldwin I of Constantinople, then Count of Flanders. The couple sailed from Marseille in 1204 with a convoy of warriors who intended to join the Fourth Crusade, but on reaching Cyprus, they attempted to claim the island as inheritors of Isaac. The attempt failed, and they fled to Armenia.\nCOMMENT\nSo Isaac Komnenos, not only falsified papers to become Emperor of Cyprus, he created an independent Patriarchy to crown him.

Properties owned by the over-60s demographic are collectively valued at an astounding £2.95 trillion, with only £60 billion of this sum representing outstanding mortgage debt.\nIn stark contrast, individuals under 35 possess property assets totalling £600 billion—half of which consists of mortgage obligations.\nLucian Cook, the distinguished head of residential research at Savills, commented: “Throughout the past decade, debt has become an increasingly less significant component in the growth valuation of our nation’s housing stock, with substantially more equity becoming concentrated amongst older homeowners and property investors.\n“The baby boomer generation has continued to accumulate considerable wealth after having paid off their mortgage debts, whilst Generation X has been diligently working to achieve comparable financial security.\n“Meanwhile, Generations Y and Z have experienced substantially reduced opportunities to progress profitably through the housing ladder.”\nThis development emerges as members of the boomer generation face mounting societal and political pressure to consider downsizing their properties to liberate suitable homes for younger families struggling to enter the property market.\nLast month, former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s influential think tank proposed that larger properties should face higher taxation to actively encourage homeowners to downsize from properties that exceed their current spatial requirements.\nResearchers at the Tony Blair Institute put forth a controversial recommendation that the existing council tax system—in which bills are presently calculated based on property values from April 1991—should be completely dismantled and substituted with a more progressive levy set at 0.5 per cent of each home’s current market valuation.\nThomas Smith, the institute’s director of economic policy, elaborated that such a reform would “incentivise homeowners occupying larger, under-utilised properties to downsize, thereby improving housing market fluidity and supporting greater economic mobility across the country.”\nStatistical evidence from the English Housing Survey indicates that nearly 10 million residences across England possessed at least two unoccupied bedrooms during the previous year, with pensioners representing the most substantial proportion of these spacious property owners.\nHowever, David Forsdyke, a senior representative of Knight Frank Finance, observed that elderly homeowners typically find themselves in the paradoxical position of being “asset rich, but cash poor,” noting that their pension arrangements frequently prove insufficient to cover escalating living expenses in the current economic climate.\nRecent figures published by the Equity Release Council revealed that the monetary sum extracted from property values increased by approximately one-third during the three months concluding in March, compared to the same period in the previous year.\nMr Forsdyke further explained: “Older homeowners are increasingly borrowing against their property assets to address their cost of living, which has risen dramatically over the past five years.\n“Equity release schemes offer a practical solution whereby these individuals can strategically draw down modest sums to supplement their regular income. Many others simply opt to borrow against their property wealth to financially assist their children or grandchildren, effectively facilitating earlier intergenerational wealth transfer.”\nThe growing disparity between property ownership amongst different generations highlights profound structural changes within the British housing market. While baby boomers benefited from more accessible property prices during their early adulthood, subsequent generations have encountered significantly inflated housing costs relative to earnings, stricter mortgage lending criteria, and greater financial obstacles to homeownership.\nThis generational wealth inequality poses complex challenges for policymakers attempting to balance respect for property rights with the need to address housing shortages for younger families. The situation raises important questions about intergenerational fairness and the future structure of housing provision across the United Kingdom.\nProperty experts suggest that without substantive intervention through policy reform or significant market changes, this wealth disparity may continue to widen, further exacerbating the already considerable challenges faced by younger generations attempting to secure suitable housing.\nThe reluctance of many older homeowners to downsize, despite possessing surplus space, often stems from emotional attachments to family homes, the prohibitive costs associated with moving, and the limited availability of appropriate smaller properties in desirable locations with adequate amenities for older residents.\nSome financial advisers advocate for more innovative solutions that might enable older homeowners to remain in cherished properties whilst simultaneously releasing equity to support their retirement needs or provide financial assistance to younger family members navigating an increasingly challenging economic landscape.",

The government said it would save up to 700 lives each year. In the UK in 2017, 411 people died before the right donor was found, and more than 5,000 people are currently on the waiting list in England.\nA similar opt-out system has been in place in Wales since 2015. Scotland plans to introduce a similar scheme and Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest. The legislation was subsequently introduced last year, and will return to the House of Commons in the autumn to be voted on.\nIf passed, it is expected to come into effect in England in spring 2020 – because the timetable for its introduction will allow for a year of “transition” to the new law. The government said it would also encourage people to discuss, with their families, the issue of whether they would want to be a donor in the event of their death.\nAround 6,000 people in Britain are on the transplant waiting list and more than 400 patients died while waiting for a transplant last year, the public health service said.\nThe new system presumes that over-18s in England are in favour of donating their organs when they die, instead of the current system where people opt in by signing the NHS Organ Donor Register. Under the new law, those who do not wish to donate their organs will still be able to opt out via the register and by using an NHS app that launches at the end of the year.\nThe register will also include an option for people to state their faith, if it is important to their decision.\nCurrently, fewer than half of families give consent for their loved one’s organs to be donated if they are unaware of their wishes, and ministers hope that the new system will encourage people to make their wishes known before their death. Research shows 82% of people support organ donation, yet only 37% have recorded their wishes on the NHS Organ Donor Register.\nUnder the new plans, specialist nurses will be on hand to discuss donation with families after a loved one dies.\nThe NHS is being forced to treat hundreds of Britons who have gone abroad for black-market kidney transplants which go wrong. Patients have returned with serious health problems including HIV and at least one has died from complications caused by the poor treatment overseas. Many are driven to use the booming £1 billion global transplant tourism trade because of the shortage of available organs in the UK.\nA ‘kingpin’ international organ trafficker based in Nepal who sells kidneys to Britons in packages costing £30,000;\nHundreds of Britons who buy KIDNEYS on the black market from overseas traffickers charging £30,000 in a bid to avoid NHS waiting lists are coming back with deadly diseases such as HIV and hepatitis\nCOMMENT\nI understand that my opinion may be contrary to ‘The Hyppocratic Oath’ however I feel that organ donation has taken a sinister direction with people paying large sums for organs from the third world. within the USA, thousands of young people disappear each year, amidst allegations that they are harvested for their organs. In China, prisoners on death row, are tested and then killed when a donor is matched to them, this is not the way forward for humanity.\nWe hear argument in support of the ‘opt-out’ system, which is probably the greatest of all perversions of civil liberty, NOBODY should have a right, to plunder your body unless you specifically agree to it.\nI am of the opinion that mankind’s constant refusal to accept the mortal process has a lot to answer for. Should we not be concentrating on a better quality of life for all, rather than fighting the natural process of mother nature? Should we not be more concerned about concentrating on the quality of life for those able to live it?\nThere is a deeply ingrained mindset here that runs very deep, because it is this refusal to come to terms with our own mortality that drives greed, oppression and where this is concerned, possibly the loss of one life, to extend (not save EXTEND) the life of another, simply because they are in the fortunate position of being able to pay for an organ donation.\nDONATION……….there’s a word, under this legislation, it will not be donation, it will be legalised theft, as in most cases people may not get round to ‘opting out’\nI do not agree.\nThe Hippocratic Oath is an oath historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing Gods, to uphold specific ethical standards.\n‘To uphold specific ethical standards’ Maybe it is time to take a closer look at what is ETHICAL?",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_city-analysts-warn-labour-party-poised-for-15bn-tax-overhaul/content_1220.html": "City Analysts Warn Labour Party Poised for £15bn Tax Overhaul\nFinancial experts at a prominent City institution have cautioned that should the Labour Party secure a significant majority in the upcoming general election, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves may orchestrate a substantial £15bn tax reform come autumn. This sweeping fiscal adjustment is anticipated to target pensions, capital gains, and inheritance, according to analysts at the esteemed investment bank Citi.\nBenjamin Nabarro, Citi’s chief UK economist, posits that Reeves is likely to acquiesce to mounting pressure for increased public expenditure. Moreover, the Labour Party might extend what has been termed a ‘stealth raid’ on workers’ pay packets, should they emerge victorious at the polls.\nIn his analysis, Nabarro asserted that Labour would “ultimately tax and spend more than the current baseline”. He further cautioned that the “rot” of sluggish economic growth in the United Kingdom had become deeply entrenched, exacerbated by a wave of post-crisis regulatory measures.\nThe Citi report suggests that the forthcoming quinquennium is likely to usher in a “painful, but also probably unavoidable” trajectory towards higher taxation under a Labour administration. This stark forecast underscores the fiscal challenges that may lie ahead for the UK economy, regardless of the electoral outcome.\nNabarro identified several potential avenues for revenue generation that the Labour Party might explore. Chief among these are reductions in tax relief on pension contributions, modifications to inheritance tax regulations, and adjustments to capital gains tax. These measures alone could potentially raise up to £8bn annually, a significant sum that has fuelled widespread concerns about Ms Reeves’ intentions regarding retirement savings.\n“We therefore expect some further tightening in the autumn,” Nabarro elaborated. “Here, the most likely revenue candidates could be changes in pension contribution relief after Rachel Reeves ruled out changes in the lifetime allowance, reform to capital gains, and changes to inheritance tax. These are in addition to revenue changes in Labour’s manifesto.”\nIt is worth noting that Ms Reeves has consistently declined to rule out an increase in capital gains tax, although she has insisted that Labour has “no plans” to raise this particular levy. This careful phrasing has left room for speculation about potential future adjustments to the tax regime.\nThroughout the election campaign, Labour has categorically ruled out increases to income tax, National Insurance contributions, and Value Added Tax (VAT). However, senior party figures have repeatedly failed to dismiss the possibility of other tax hikes, leaving voters and analysts alike to ponder the full extent of Labour’s fiscal strategy.\nNabarro’s analysis goes further, suggesting that Labour may be contemplating additional tax rises beyond those already mentioned. “Wider reforms – such as changes to council tax – will probably take longer,” he noted. “We would not rule out changes to various tax thresholds – including income tax. But in total, we think a total tightening of £15bn in an October budget is not an unreasonable base case here.”\nIt is pertinent to note that the current Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has already implemented a six-year freeze on income tax thresholds. This measure is projected to push millions of people into higher tax bands by the close of the decade, effectively increasing the tax burden on a significant portion of the population without explicitly raising tax rates.\nThe Citi analysis comes in the wake of a leaked recording that has sent shockwaves through political circles. The recording purportedly reveals that Labour is contemplating an inheritance tax raid to “redistribute” wealth should they ascend to power. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, suggested that increased death duties could be employed as a mechanism to address “inter-generational inequality”.\nWhen questioned about this potential policy on Wednesday, Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, did not categorically rule out such a move. He told Good Morning Britain: “From that moment we’ve said that nothing in our manifesto requires us to raise any taxes beyond the very specific things that we’ve set out in the manifesto, and that remains the position on this as with anything else.” This carefully worded response has done little to quell speculation about Labour’s true intentions regarding inheritance tax.\nIn response to these revelations, Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the Treasury, issued a stark warning: “Labour are plotting a hidden tax raid that is not in their manifesto and if they are given a super-majority on Thursday they will be free to impose it.” This statement underscores the growing concern among Conservative ranks about the potential fiscal implications of a Labour victory.\nInterestingly, the Citi report also noted that even a Conservative majority government would likely involve “some [fiscal] tightening”, albeit occurring “in fits and bursts”. This observation suggests that regardless of the election outcome, British taxpayers may face increased fiscal pressure in the coming years.\nNabarro painted a sombre picture of the UK’s tax and spending outlook, describing it as “dark”. He added that Labour would also face pressure to increase defence spending, further straining Whitehall budgets. “Demand for additional spending remains significant,” he explained. “In recent years, performance indicators for the public sector have deteriorated. Metrics such as waiting times for A&E, elective surgery, or the gap between reported offences and prosecutions have all widened.”\nThe economist went on to highlight the changing landscape of national defence spending: “Other historical supports such as trend reductions in defence spending are also likely to reverse – we think any government will now likely increase defence spending to 2.5pc GDP by 2030.” This projection underscores the multifaceted nature of the fiscal challenges facing the next government, regardless of its political persuasion.\nCiti’s analysis also drew attention to the broader economic context, warning that the end of an era characterised by ultra-low interest rates and cheap public borrowing for the UK would likely keep borrowing levels – and consequently, Britain’s debt burden – high. Nabarro succinctly summarised this challenge: “The challenge is adjustment to this new fiscal reality is only now beginning.”\nIn a parallel development, Goldman Sachs has issued a warning that Labour’s proposed tax on private schools could potentially push up inflation. The investment bank also suggested that Labour’s pledge to introduce a “genuine living wage” might result in interest rates remaining higher for longer than previously anticipated.\nThis cautionary note comes at a time when price rises have only just returned to the Bank of England’s 2pc target, highlighting the delicate balance that must be struck between fiscal policy and inflation management.\n“Labour’s fiscal policies would also likely have a mechanical impact on inflation via the proposed introduction of VAT on private school fees,” Goldman Sachs stated in a note to clients. The bank elaborated: “Faster demand growth and the possibility of stronger wage growth in April 2025 – depending on how Labour’s living wage policy takes shape – point to risks of slightly firmer inflationary pressures.”\nRegarding the potential implications for monetary policy, Goldman Sachs noted: “The implications for the [Bank of England] would likely be limited, but with risks of slower rate cuts if Labour delivered a sizable increase in the living wage.”\nAs of the time of writing, the minimum wage for individuals aged 21 and over stands at £11.44 per hour. While Labour has yet to specify a target figure for their proposed “genuine living wage”, it is worth noting that the Living Wage Foundation has set its recommended hourly rate at £12 outside London and £13.15 within the capital.\nIn conclusion, as the UK approaches a pivotal general election, the potential fiscal implications of a Labour victory are coming under intense scrutiny. While the party has made efforts to reassure voters about their tax plans, analysis from respected financial institutions suggests that significant changes to the UK’s tax landscape may be on the horizon. As always, the true impact of any new fiscal policies will only become clear in the fullness of time, leaving voters, economists, and policymakers alike to watch developments with keen interest in the months and years to come.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_almost-1m-people-across-europe-are-homeless/content_388.html": "Almost 1m people across Europe are homeless\nThe Ongoing Crisis of Homelessness in Europe\nAcross Europe, homelessness remains a persistent and growing crisis. A new report from the Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (Feantsa) reveals the scale of the problem, with nearly 1 million Europeans homeless each night. This staggering figure highlights the urgent need for comprehensive solutions centered on housing as a fundamental human right.\nThe Shocking Scale of European Homelessness\nFeantsa estimates that at least 895,000 individuals experience homelessness across Europe per night. This minimum estimate reflects only the most visible forms of homelessness, including rough sleepers, those in shelters, and people staying temporarily with others due to lack of housing. It does not account for those living long-term with friends or relatives or in dangerously substandard housing.\nThe data encompasses official census records, local authority figures, and surveys. While exact numbers remain elusive, it is clear homelessness affects a population comparable to major European cities like Marseille or Turin.\nDirector Freek Spinnewijn lamented that most European governments continue to fail the homeless by simply managing the problem rather than solving it through systematic changes. Even as homelessness persists, the EU has pledged to work toward its abolition by 2030. So far, only Denmark and Finland have made demonstrable progress.\nCategories and Causes of Homelessness\nHomelessness takes diverse forms across Europe. The Feantsa report focuses on six primary categories:\n– Rough sleepers – People sleeping outside or in public spaces without shelter. This group faces urgent health risks.\n– Users of emergency/temporary accommodation – Individuals staying in shelters, hostels, or other short-term housing arrangements.\n– People living in institutions – Those residing long-term in facilities like hospitals with no permanent housing arranged post-discharge.\n– People living in non-conventional dwellings – Squatters and those taking up residence in sheds, garages, or mobile homes unfit for habitation.\n– Homeless people living temporarily with family/friends – Individuals without a permanent living situation staying with others.\n– People living under threat of eviction – Families or individuals at immediate risk of losing housing with no alternatives lined up.\nThe causes behind these categories vary based on local context but include poverty, unemployment, mental illness, family breakdowns, gentrification, lack of affordable housing, migration, and inequality. Housing costs have hit crisis levels in many European nations, displacing even working families.\nWhile homelessness results from multiple factors, the lack of affordable, adequate housing remains the overarching issue. With housing treated as a commodity rather than necessity, vulnerable populations continue falling through the cracks.\nCountry-By-Country Data and Trends\nThe scale and nature of homelessness differ across European nations. According to 2020 data:\n– Germany tallied over 260,000 homeless residents based on census records. Shelters are strictly temporary, pushing many onto the streets.\n– Denmark saw a 10% reduction in homelessness from 2019-2022 thanks to supported housing programs. Their “housing first” model focuses on eliminating homelessness.\n– Spain’s government reported over 28,500 homeless people, while civil groups estimate much higher figures in the hundreds of thousands.\n– Ireland saw a 40% increase in emergency housing applicants from 2020 to 2022 as the lack of affordable housing reaches crisis proportions.\n– In Bulgaria, one in eight households lack indoor plumbing. Substandard accommodation affects lower income families across eastern Europe.\n– Close to 20% of housing in France is considered unfit for habitation due to disrepair, overcrowding, and lack of utilities.\nWhile data remains spotty, the report makes clear homelessness is worsening in most European nations while only Finland and Denmark make measurable progress. Free market housing policies have failed to adequately address affordability and accessibility. For countries like Ireland with severe shortages of affordable housing, the report calls upon leaders to fix dysfunctional housing systems.\nHealth and Social Impacts of Homelessness\nBeyond the basic violation of human dignity, homelessness takes major physical and emotional tolls. Without stable shelter, individuals face increased risks of trauma, exposure, malnutrition, epidemics, and violence. Mental illness, addiction, and chronic disease flow directly from unstable living conditions.\nFor children, homelessness can permanently damage education, relationships, and development. Constant stress compounds psychological problems over time. Entire generations raised in poverty, instability, and deprivation are denied equal opportunities in life before even reaching adulthood.\nOn a societal level, homelessness strains public resources for emergency services and shelters. Lack of housing leads to unemployment, addiction, incarceration and greater reliance on government assistance. Investing in affordable, stable housing for all would relieve these burdens while creating healthier, more just communities.\nSteps Toward Ending Homelessness\nWhile homelessness persists across most of Europe, Demark’s model proves solutions exist. Their success stems from viewing housing as a basic human need rather than just an economic matter. Key steps European nations can take include:\n– Shift to a “housing first” philosophy making permanent housing the central goal rather than temporary shelters.\n– Construct quality public housing available based on need, not ability to pay. Prioritize affordable options for seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and low-income families.\n– Strengthen tenant rights and eviction protections to increase housing stability. Institute rent controls.\n– Enact zoning policies discouraging gentrification and displacement from urban neighborhoods.\n– Fully fund and expand emergency shelters, outreach programs, and transitional housing to address short-term needs.\n– Increase public assistance to cover housing costs and basic needs for those unable to work.\n– Invest in accessible physical and mental healthcare to provide critical support to the homeless population.\n– Collect comprehensive data on all facets of homelessness for better-informed policies.\nWith vision and commitment, Europe can transition away from merely containing homelessness to actively abolishing it. But it will require challenging engrained economic and social structures. Only by guaranteeing housing as a basic right, prioritizing people over profits, can these nations live up to their humanitarian ideals. There is no quick fix, but following Denmark’s model of expanded public programs centered on providing permanent housing offers hope for ending homelessness in Europe once and for all.\nThe situation in the UK\nNew research from Shelter shows at least 271,000 people are recorded as homeless in England, including 123,000 children.\nShelter’s detailed analysis of official homelessness figures and responses to a Freedom of Information request shows that one in 208 people in England are without a home. Of these, 2,400 people are sleeping rough on any given night, 15,000 people are in hostels or supported accommodation and nearly 250,000 are living in temporary accommodation – most of whom are families.\nThe number of people living in temporary accommodation has risen by an alarming 74% in the last 10 years – something the charity argues is driven by the chronic shortage of social homes, and an over-reliance on grossly expensive and unstable private renting.\nMore than two-thirds of families (68%) living in temporary accommodation have been there for over a year, showing this type of accommodation is becoming less and less “temporary” as families cannot escape homelessness due to the severe lack of affordable homes. This is a situation made even worse by the three-year freeze on housing benefit, and cost of living crisis.",

Cristian Terhes, a Romanian Member of the European Parliament (MEP), voiced concerns over the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), likening it to the creation of a government-sponsored “Ministry of Truth” reminiscent of Orwell’s fictional world.\nTerhes commented to The Telegraph, “The European Commission has taken a page out of Orwell’s 1984 and demanded that EU member states set up government-sponsored ministries of truth to ensure that wrong thoughts and banned words are not allowed into the digital space.”\nRegulating Online Content\nThe DSA, which came into force on August 25, outlines the requirement for the EU’s 27 member states to establish a network of “trusted flaggers.” These experts are individuals with prior experience in monitoring and identifying harmful or illegal online content. The primary objective of this regulation is to establish new standards for combating hate speech, disinformation, and counterfeit products online, and it is applicable to all major digital platforms.\nOriginally aimed at tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook operating in Europe, the DSA will be extended to websites and online platforms that attract at least 45 million monthly users.\nImpact on Tech Giants\nThe EU’s venture into regulating big tech has already yielded notable results. For instance, Twitter, now known as X, was compelled to introduce a new hate speech policy blocking users from disseminating “hateful imagery” like the Nazi swastika. The DSA also prohibits targeted advertisements based on users’ region, gender, or sexual preferences, and it introduces a mechanism requiring platforms to disclose the measures they are taking to combat alleged misinformation or propaganda.\nIn response, tech giants have expanded their teams to navigate the intricate bureaucracy imposed by the EU. Facebook’s Sir Nick Clegg revealed that the company had assigned over 1,000 staff, constituting one of the “largest cross-functional teams in our history,” to ensure compliance. TikTok also announced a similar commitment, assigning more than 1,000 staff members to handle compliance matters.\nLegal Challenges and Controversy\nHowever, some digital heavyweights, such as Amazon and German online retailer Zalando, have initiated legal challenges to contest their classification as “very large online platforms” under the new rules.\nProtecting Freedom of Speech\nEU officials have sought to assure the public that the system is not intended to curtail freedom of speech or expression. They argue that trusted flaggers will be appointed by national bodies established by member states, thereby ensuring that their legal systems can enforce the DSA. This approach is meant to distance the EU from direct influence over content.\nA spokesperson for the commission emphasized, “Under the DSA, providers of online platforms shall take the necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure that notices submitted by trusted flaggers are given priority and are processed and decided upon without undue delay. That being said, nothing in the DSA obliges platforms to remove lawful content.”\nConclusion\nAs the EU takes its first major steps in regulating the digital landscape, the debate over the balance between combating misinformation and preserving free expression rages on, leaving many to ponder the implications of this “Ministry of Truth” in the digital age. The trusted flagger scheme is not expected to be fully implemented until February 2024, meaning that this contentious issue is likely to continue shaping discussions surrounding online content regulation in the years to come.",

In Cyprus, as elsewhere, this disease creates ripples of suffering that extend far beyond the patients themselves, touching families, friends, and entire communities. While medical science continues to make remarkable strides in diagnosis and treatment, the need for innovative approaches to fund critical research remains urgent.\nThe “Support the Valley of Life and Fight Cancer” initiative presents a visionary solution that addresses multiple challenges simultaneously: raising essential funds for cancer research, repurposing unused land, combating climate change, and creating a meaningful memorial space for those affected by cancer. By inviting individuals to donate and plant trees on non-arable land across Cyprus, we can transform barren hillsides and unused plots into living monuments of hope and healing—a true Valley of Life.\nThe Global Cancer Challenge: Facts and Figures\nCancer represents not just a medical crisis but a humanitarian one. Understanding the scope of this challenge underscores the urgency of our mission:\n- Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, responsible for nearly 10 million deaths annually—approximately one in six deaths worldwide.\n- More than 19 million new cancer cases are diagnosed each year, a figure projected to rise to over 30 million by 2040 without significant intervention.\n- The economic impact of cancer exceeds $1.16 trillion annually in healthcare costs and lost productivity.\n- While cancer affects all demographics, approximately 70% of cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment remains limited.\n- In Cyprus specifically, cancer accounts for approximately 25% of all deaths, with colorectal, breast, prostate, and lung cancers being among the most prevalent forms.\n- Research funding directly correlates with survival improvements—countries that invest more in cancer research consistently show better patient outcomes and higher survival rates.\n- Recent advances in immunotherapy, targeted treatments, and early detection have dramatically improved survival rates for many cancers, demonstrating that research funding delivers tangible results.\n- Despite progress, many rare and aggressive cancers remain without effective treatments, highlighting the continued need for research investment.\nThe emotional and psychological toll of cancer extends far beyond the physical symptoms. Patients often face anxiety, depression, and existential distress, while family members and caregivers experience their own profound psychological challenges. Any comprehensive response to cancer must address these dimensions as well.\nThe Environmental Challenge in Cyprus\nCyprus faces unique environmental challenges that make our initiative particularly relevant:\n- As the third-largest island in the Mediterranean, Cyprus has experienced significant deforestation throughout its history, with forest cover reduced to approximately 18.7% of the island’s total area.\n- Climate change poses an acute threat to Cyprus, with rising temperatures, increased drought frequency, and soil degradation already evident.\n- The island experiences among the highest rates of temperature increase in the Mediterranean region, approximately 1.5 times the global average.\n- Desertification threatens approximately 57% of the island’s territory, with soil erosion affecting agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.\n- Water scarcity represents a persistent challenge, with strategic forest planting offering potential benefits for groundwater retention and watershed management.\n- Much of Cyprus’s non-arable land—particularly on hillsides and in areas with poor soil quality—currently provides minimal ecological or economic benefit but holds tremendous potential for reforestation.\n- The island’s unique Mediterranean ecosystem includes numerous endemic plant and animal species that depend on healthy forest habitats for survival.\n- Strategic reforestation can help reverse habitat fragmentation, creating wildlife corridors that allow species to migrate and adapt to changing climatic conditions.\nThe Valley of Life: A Transformative Vision\nThe “Support the Valley of Life” initiative proposes a comprehensive approach to addressing both the funding needs of cancer research and the environmental challenges facing Cyprus:\nCore Components of the Initiative\n- Land Identification and Preparation: Working with landowners across Cyprus to identify non-arable land suitable for reforestation. These parcels, often inappropriate for agriculture or development, will be assessed for soil conditions, water availability, and ecological context to determine appropriate planting strategies.\n- Species Selection: Carefully choosing native and climate-appropriate tree species that will thrive in Cyprus’s Mediterranean climate while providing maximum environmental benefits. Emphasis will be placed on drought-resistant varieties that require minimal irrigation after establishment, as well as species that provide habitat for native wildlife.\n- Donation Structure: Creating a transparent donation system where individuals, families, or organizations can contribute to the planting and maintenance of trees. Different donation levels will be available, allowing participants to fund single trees, small groves, or entire sections of the Valley of Life.\n- Memorial Elements: Developing tasteful, environmentally friendly methods for commemorating the individuals honoured by tree donations. This may include discreet plaques, an online memorial registry, or periodic ceremonies to acknowledge new plantings and the people they represent.\n- Research Funding: Establishing clear mechanisms for directing funds to reputable cancer research institutions, with regular reporting on the impact of contributions. A scientific advisory committee will help identify high-priority research initiatives deserving support.\n- Educational Component: Creating opportunities for school groups, community organizations, and the general public to learn about both cancer awareness and environmental sustainability through visits to the Valley of Life.\n- Volunteer Engagement: Developing programs that allow cancer survivors, family members, and other community members to participate directly in planting and maintenance activities, creating a therapeutic engagement with the project.\n- Long-term Stewardship: Implementing a sustainable management plan that ensures the health and longevity of the forest, including fire prevention measures, invasive species control, and strategic thinning when necessary.\nExpected Outcomes\nThe Valley of Life initiative aims to achieve multiple meaningful outcomes:\n- Raising substantial funds for cancer research, potentially millions of euros over the project’s lifetime.\n- Creating a tangible, living memorial that provides comfort and meaning to those who have lost loved ones to cancer.\n- Reforesting significant portions of currently unused land, potentially thousands of hectares as the initiative expands.\n- Sequestering thousands of tons of carbon annually, helping Cyprus meet its climate commitments.\n- Reducing soil erosion by as much as 80% in planted areas through root systems that bind soil and reduce water runoff.\n- Improving local microclimates through temperature moderation, increased humidity, and wind protection.\n- Creating new habitat for native wildlife, potentially including threatened or endangered species.\n- Developing a model of environmental philanthropy that could be replicated in other regions facing similar challenges.\nThe Science Behind the Benefits\nEnvironmental Benefits of Reforestation\nThe environmental advantages of strategic tree planting in Cyprus are substantial and well-documented:\n- Carbon Sequestration: Mature forests can sequester 5-10 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare annually. A forest of 1,000 hectares could potentially offset the annual carbon emissions of over 2,000 average European households.\n- Soil Conservation: Tree roots dramatically reduce soil erosion, with studies showing that forested hillsides experience 90% less soil loss than bare slopes during heavy rain events. This is particularly important in Cyprus, where topsoil loss threatens agricultural productivity.\n- Biodiversity Support: Forests provide habitat for hundreds of species. In Cyprus specifically, reforestation efforts can support endangered species like the Cyprus mouflon, the Cyprus wheatear, and numerous endemic plant species found nowhere else on Earth.\n- Water Cycle Regulation: Forest cover improves groundwater recharge rates by slowing runoff and allowing water to penetrate soil. This is critical in Cyprus, where water scarcity remains a persistent challenge.\n- Air Quality Improvement: Trees filter particulate matter from the air and release oxygen. One hectare of mature forest can produce enough oxygen to meet the needs of 18 people annually.\n- Temperature Moderation: Forests create microclimate effects that can reduce local temperatures by 2-8°C compared to unforested areas, helping mitigate the urban heat island effect in nearby communities.\n- Natural Disaster Mitigation: Strategic forest planting can reduce flood risk by absorbing rainfall and slowing water movement, while also creating firebreaks when properly managed.\nThe Psychological Benefits of Memorial Forests\nThe concept of memorial forests has deep roots in many cultures, and modern research confirms their psychological value:\n- Studies show that natural memorial settings provide greater comfort to the bereaved than traditional memorial sites, offering a sense of ongoing life and renewal.\n- The act of planting a tree in memory of a loved one provides a therapeutic ritual that can help process grief through physical engagement with the natural world.\n- Memorial forests create accessible spaces for remembrance that evolve and grow over time, paralleling the way that grief and memory change through the years.\n- Green spaces have been consistently shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression—all common experiences among those affected by cancer, whether as patients, survivors, or family members.\n- Participating in environmental restoration projects provides a sense of agency and positive impact that can be particularly valuable for those who feel helpless in the face of cancer’s effects.\n- Creating intergenerational memorials allows families to maintain connections with loved ones across time, with trees potentially living for centuries.\nThe Connection Between Environment and Cancer\nThe relationship between environmental health and cancer prevention is increasingly recognized by the scientific community:\n- Environmental factors contribute to an estimated 30% of all cancer cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.\n- Exposure to air pollution has been linked to increased rates of lung, bladder, and other cancers. Forests act as natural air filters, potentially reducing exposure to carcinogenic pollutants.\n- Climate change is expected to increase cancer rates through multiple mechanisms, including increased exposure to UV radiation, changing patterns of food production affecting nutrition, and disruption of healthcare systems during extreme weather events.\n- Access to green spaces correlates with higher levels of physical activity, which is associated with reduced risk for several cancer types, including breast and colorectal cancers.\n- Environmental toxins can concentrate in degraded ecosystems, while healthy forests help filter water and soil, potentially reducing exposure to carcinogenic compounds.\nBy supporting both environmental restoration and cancer research, the Valley of Life initiative addresses both treatment and prevention aspects of cancer control.\nBenefits Specific to Cyprus\nThe initiative offers particular advantages for Cyprus as a nation:\n- Tourism Enhancement: The Valley of Life could become a destination for eco-tourism and memorial tourism, attracting visitors interested in both environmental sustainability and meaningful memorial experiences.\n- International Recognition: As one of the first comprehensive programs linking cancer research funding with large-scale reforestation, Cyprus could gain recognition as an innovator in environmental philanthropy.\n- Climate Commitment Advancement: The project would help Cyprus meet its commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement and EU climate policies through natural carbon sequestration.\n- Water Security Improvement: Strategic forest placement can enhance watershed protection, potentially improving water security in a region where this resource is increasingly precious.\n- Wildfire Risk Reduction: When properly designed and maintained, strategic reforestation can create firebreaks and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires that have affected Cyprus in recent years.\n- Community Cohesion: The project offers opportunities for diverse communities within Cyprus to work together toward common goals, potentially strengthening social bonds across different demographic groups.\n- Economic Opportunities: The initiative could create jobs in forestry management, eco-tourism, and related fields, particularly in rural areas where employment opportunities may be limited.\n- Educational Resource Development: The Valley of Life would provide a living laboratory for environmental education, offering schools and universities a valuable resource for hands-on learning.\nImplementation Roadmap\nPhase One: Pilot Project (Year 1)\n- Identify 5-10 hectares of suitable non-arable land for the initial planting.\n- Secure commitments from landowners for long-term forest preservation.\n- Establish partnerships with key stakeholders, including cancer research institutions, environmental organizations, and government agencies.\n- Develop donation infrastructure,

Government Representatives\n- Consider policy mechanisms that could support and accelerate the initiative, such as tax incentives for landowners or matching funds for donations.\n- Integrate the Valley of Life concept into national climate action plans and biodiversity conservation strategies.\n- Help streamline any regulatory processes associated with land use changes and reforestation activities.\nFor Educational Institutions\n- Develop research projects that monitor and document the ecological impacts of the Valley of Life.\n- Create curriculum materials that use the initiative as a case study in environmental science, public health, and social innovation.\n- Organize field trips and service-learning opportunities for students to engage directly with the project.\nConclusion\nThe “Support the Valley of Life and Fight Cancer” initiative represents a visionary approach to addressing two of the most significant challenges facing humanity: cancer and environmental degradation. By linking these causes through a tangible, participatory program of tree planting and forest creation, we offer people affected by cancer a meaningful way to channel grief into hope, while simultaneously creating lasting environmental benefits for Cyprus and the planet.\nAs the initiative grows from its pilot phase into a comprehensive national program, the Valley of Life will stand as a testament to the power of collaborative action—a place where memories are honored, research is advanced, and nature is renewed. Each tree planted represents both a tribute to someone affected by cancer and a commitment to a healthier future for all.\nIn the face of challenges that might seem overwhelming when faced alone, the Valley of Life demonstrates how collective action can create meaningful change. We invite all who care about cancer research, environmental sustainability, or the future of Cyprus to join us in building this living legacy—one tree, one donation, one memory at a time.\nTogether, we can transform loss into life, barren hillsides into vibrant forests, and today’s research funding into tomorrow’s cancer breakthroughs. The Valley of Life awaits our shared vision and commitment.\nI cannot make this happen alone, I need your support, I need people to identify land that could be turned over to tree planting without causing any loss to agriculture or farming, your support to spread the message, approach donors, identify trees that are suitable for the environment, funds management, logistics and much more.\nFor more information on how to participate as a donor, landowner, or volunteer, please contact me . To learn more about the specific cancer research projects supported by this initiative.\nThis initiative is in honour of those who have lost their lives to Cancer, it would be wonderful if this will succeed and if in time, this were to be replicated around the world.",

The body, which was badly decomposed, was found by a German photographer who was taking pictures in the area which he visited often.\nThe dead woman was retrieved from a shaft at a depth of 15 to 20 metres at 8.30pm by fire services and police. Police are looking at all possibilities, including murder, police spokesman Andreas Angelides said on Monday. They are checking their register of missing people to see whether there is a possible match. Officers are also questioning residents near the mine.\nThe post mortem, carried out by state pathologists Sofocles Sofocleous and Nicolas Charalambous, on Monday morning did not shed light on the cause of the woman’s death although it was reported that no stab wounds or gun injuries were found. Tissue was sent for histopathological and other tests.\nThe pathologists did not say how long they thought the body had been at the mine. Authorities are also trying to determine whether she was alive or dead when she was thrown into the mine shaft. According to state radio, she was 1.60 to 1.65 metres tall and probably Asian.\n“From the findings at the scene, we are examining the possibility of a criminal act,” Angelides said.\nHe said that the first thing was to identify the woman as well as going through the registry of missing persons, adding she may not have been reported as missing. According to state broadcaster CyBC, police said there are 32 unsolved cases concerning persons reported as missing dating as far back as 1990, including Asian persons.\n“We will look into everything concerning this case,” Angelides said.\nAlthough he admitted he is not involved in the case, former state pathologist Marios Matsakis told media on Monday morning that it looked like a case of callous murder that was reminiscent of a previous case where the body of a woman was found down a well.\n“There is no doubt that this is a callous murder. It will be a difficult forensic investigation because of the body’s decay,” he said. Matsakis said it reminded him of the Oxana Lisna case 25 years ago. “That was a double murder, the body of one woman was found in Kotsiatis [rubbish dump], while that of Lisna was found in a well. The murderers are now in prison,” he said.\nAntonis Kitas, known as Al Capone, and Michalsi Iacovides were convicted in 1994 for the rape and murders of Ukrainian artiste Lisna, 20, and Swedish housewife Christina Ahfeldt, 28. Lisna’s battered body was discovered down a well near Livadia village, Larnaca, while Ahfeldt’s corpse was unearthed at Kotsiatis rubbish tip outside Nicosia.\nBoth young women had been abducted, beaten and sexually assaulted before being murdered and dumped in the summer of 1993. Al Capone and Iacovides are serving life sentences for the killings.\nMatsakis said the findings on Sunday’s discovery will depend on the way she was murdered. There is a procedure usually followed in such cases to rule out everything, he said.\n“I wish for the cause of death to be determined and that the cold-blood murderers are found.”",

A key driver of this has been an influx of foreign money, especially from Russian investors and expatriates seeking to escape sanctions and find favorable economic conditions.\nA Building Boom Transforms the Landscape\nAreas like Yeni Iskele have been completely transformed from small villages just five years ago into full-fledged cities lined with gleaming high-rises. Real estate companies boast names like “Dream Town” and “Caesars,” targeting foreign buyers with promises of “a new life.”\nThe pace of construction has shocked even industry insiders. Osman Erdogan, general manager of the Riverside Life luxury apartment complex, admitted the scale of sales and speed of development surpassed all expectations. Clearly, the TRNC has tapped into strong demand from sanctioned countries like Russia and Iran.\nWhy Northern Cyprus Appeals to Foreign Investors\nThere are several factors making the TRNC especially attractive to Russian and other foreign investors right now:\nNo Sanctions Unlike the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, the TRNC is not under any sanctions related to the Ukraine war. It provides a safe haven for Russian money.\nFavorable Exchange Rates The crashing Turkish lira has created favorable exchange rates. For foreign buyers, the weak lira stretches money much further when buying TRNC property priced in liras.\nTax Benefits Loose regulations and relatively low taxes compared to other destinations like the Republic of Cyprus make the TRNC appealing from a tax optimization standpoint.\nGeographic Appeal Situated close to the Middle East, the TRNC offers an attractive climate and lifestyle for those fleeing their home countries. Many parts resemble upscale tourist destinations.\nThe Republic of Cyprus Crackdown In contrast, the Greek-aligned Republic of Cyprus has been pressured to clamp down on suspect Russian money flows by improving due diligence and aligning with EU sanctions. This has accelerated the outflow of foreign capital northward.\nConsequences for Turkish Cypriots\nThe building boom and influx of Russian and other money is proving a mixed blessing for Turkish Cypriots.\nEconomic Relief After years of economic stagnation, construction and foreign money are driving major growth. Locals welcome this after trailing their southern neighbors for so long.\nCultural Changes However, the population surge is dramatically altering the fabric of society. Experts estimate the Turkish Cypriot share of the northern population has declined from 100% to around 33% currently. This had led to feelings of alienation.\nReunification Doubts The property purchases also complicate potential reunification with the Republic of Cyprus. With so much foreign ownership and financial interest now, an equitable political settlement would be harder to negotiate.\nEnvironmental Issues Finally, the pace of unrestricted development raises environmental concerns. Entire cityscapes are emerging from what was recently wilderness, with impacts on local flora and fauna likely.\nThe Future of the Island\nWith the influx of Russian money and buyers fueling a construction spree in Northern Cyprus, the future direction of the divided island remains uncertain. The TRNC seems to be charting an independent course focused on rapid growth. However, reunification still remains the preference of many Turkish Cypriots. Much depends on relations between North and South – as well as the approach taken by external powers like Turkey. One thing though is clear: the island’s strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East guarantees it will remain contested and coveted by various interests.\nKey Takeaways\n• The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) has seen massive growth in its construction/real estate sector recently\n• This is largely driven by an influx of foreign money, especially from sanctioned Russians seeking a safe haven\n• Areas like Yeni Iskele have rapidly transformed from villages to full cities lined with luxury towers\n• Appeal factors for foreign buyers include no sanctions, favorable exchange rates, tax benefits, and lifestyle\n• While economically welcomed, consequences for Turkish Cypriots include cultural displacement and reunification difficulties\n• The future of the divided island remains uncertain – rapid development complicates diplomatic solutions\n• Strategic location guarantees outsider interest; could still see conflict between local and foreign stakeholders\n• TRNC charting an independent course focused on rapid growth and construction, while most Turkish Cypriots still desire reunification with the Republic of Cyprus\nIn summary, the influx of Russian money has sparked a building boom in Northern Cyprus – with major economic benefits but also disruptive societal side effects. The future direction of this contested region is still unfolding.",

The disgruntled group believes that Mordaunt, who currently serves as Leader of the House of Commons, would have broader appeal to centrist voters and could potentially reclaim some of the ground lost to Labour if Sunak faced a confidence vote in the coming weeks.\nDavid Mo, a senior political analyst at the Orthodox Conservatives, shed light on the matter in a recent interview. “At the moment, we’ve seen a situation where the Conservative Party has had so many leaders,” he said. “People are frustrated, the membership is frustrated, the voters are frustrated – in fact, a lot of voters are very apathetic about getting out to vote at the moment. We need some certainty, quite frankly, and we need strong Conservative leadership.”\nFor some within the party ranks, Mordaunt is viewed as a potential vehicle to provide that strong leadership. Her background in defense, having served as a Royal Navy Reserve officer, and her experience leading the House of Commons through tumultuous times, particularly in dealing with the Speaker, have bolstered her credentials in the eyes of her supporters.\nHowever, Mo acknowledged that the idea of ousting Sunak could be seen as a “turkey voting for Christmas” scenario. “At the moment, a lot of people are very unhappy in the membership, especially with the general election looming – this could be in May or October,” he said. “The Conservatives need to come into that election united, and it would have to be, as they say, a coronation really, because there’s no way the Tories can afford to have another leadership contest.”\nThe situation presents a catch-22 for many Conservative MPs and members. While some may be dissatisfied with Sunak’s leadership, there is a reluctance to initiate another leadership change due to the potential for further instability and apathy among voters. As Mo put it, “It’s quite a hard situation for a lot of members and MPs at the moment who feel, as I said, stuck in this catch-22 situation, where they’re not having the right leadership at the moment but equally don’t want yet another leader.”\nThe prospect of Mordaunt becoming the next Conservative leader remains uncertain, but her alleged behind-the-scenes campaigning for the role has not gone unnoticed. However, the harsh reality is that whoever emerges as the Conservative leader at the next general election may find themselves leading the opposition party the day after, as is often the case for outgoing prime ministers following an electoral defeat.\nMo acknowledged this likelihood, stating, “Usually, after an election, one would resign after that, so it wouldn’t last long. I think it’s a very hard situation for whoever takes on the role or whether the Prime Minister continues forward.”\nThe brewing leadership crisis within the Conservative ranks has reignited the debate over the timing of the next general election. Some argue that an early election may be the only way forward, rather than dragging the process on until October or holding another leadership contest in the interim.\nMo expressed his view on the matter, suggesting that Sunak should have taken a more muscular approach in the recent budget, potentially scrapping inheritance tax and seizing the initiative on issues like the Rwanda asylum policy. “I believe that the budget should have been more muscular and stronger,” he said. “We should have really scrapped inheritance tax. Rishi [Sunak] now should leave the ECHR, really seize the day, and actually show some results on Rwanda. That’s what needs to happen – some initiative – then call an election and then put it to the people in the ballot box.”\nHowever, the potential stumbling block for Mordaunt’s ascension lies in Sunak’s perceived moderate stance, which may not align with the desires of the more conservative wing of the party. As Mo pointed out, “This is the interesting thing because the Prime Minister, in the past, he supported Brexit. In the past, he actually modeled himself as the kind of the stronger candidate, yet it’s a fantastic opportunity for Rishi to prove to the membership and to the party that he is a man of business and that he will want to follow up on Rwanda and actually have proper legislation.”\nThe situation has become increasingly dire for the Conservatives, with defections and the looming threat of traditionally safe seats turning red in favor of Labour. Mo cited the examples of Lee Anderson’s departure and the “red wall” seats being at risk, stating, “This is a really bad situation, and some drastic measures are needed by the Conservatives to save the red wall and to save the vote.”\nAs the internal power struggles intensify within the Conservative Party, the future leadership and direction of the government remain shrouded in uncertainty. With the general election on the horizon, the party faces a critical juncture, navigating the delicate balance between appeasing its base and appealing to a broader electorate. The coming weeks and months will undoubtedly test the Conservatives’ unity and resolve as they grapple with the challenge of retaining power or risk being consigned to the opposition benches.",

We were lied to when our nation was dragged in the ‘Common Market’ and over 3 or 4 decades our country has been become wrapped up in so much red tape and political dishonesty it does not bare thinking about.\nWe have a youth who have been convinced that we will be isolated in some sort of poverty trap when we leave (if they let us) but in fact, we are in a different world to the one that gave up when we sold our soul to the EU. There is now a world trade agreement, we do not actually need trade agreements with Europe, they are already in place, but they are being used to scaremonger innocent people. We are worth more to the EU than they are to us….let us not forget that!\nAfter a year of political high drama and turbulence, and given the seeming parliamentary impasse over the Prime Minister’s deal, there are massive anxieties about the consequences of leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement in place. Will it plunge us into an economic depression as some doom-mongers predict? Will prices rocket and essential goods be in short supply? Will there be riots on the streets as the ugly new social divisions opened up by Brexit play out?\nI don’t doubt for one moment these concerns are wholly understandable and we are right to focus on them. But we should also count our blessings. We are not the only country experiencing turmoil — and for many of our neighbours it is far worse. Around Europe, many leaders are spending Christmas contemplating chaos and confusion politically, and widespread public dissatisfaction, growing unrest and even violence. For some, economic winter is already descending.\nThe level of corruption that has engulfed the EU is beyond imagination, but what are we to expect from an administration that does not have accountability? What are we to expect from a club that makes decisions in private, one that punishes it’s members by making them forfeit their pension if they criticise the EU? This ‘club’ is rotten to the core.\nWe have seen this club create debt throughout Europe and then force the citizens who were INNOCENT to pay the price. The UK will have absolutely no commercial losses by leaving, despite the scaremongering, but we may just be saving ourselves from the downward vortex that is engulfing the EU, one that will not end well.\nThere is only one thing we should fear more than leaving, that is remaining.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_what-is-ttip/content_294.html": "The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a series of trade negotiations being carried out mostly in secret between the EU and US. As a bi-lateral trade agreement, TTIP is about reducing the regulatory barriers to trade for big business, things like food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and the sovereign powers of individual nations. It is, as John Hilary, Executive Director of campaign group War on Want, said: “An assault on European and US societies by transnational corporations.”\nSince before TTIP negotiations began last February, the process has been secretive and undemocratic. This secrecy is on-going, with nearly all information on negotiations coming from leaked documents and Freedom of Information requests.\nBut worryingly, the covert nature of the talks may well be the least of our problems. Here are six other reasons why we should be scared of TTIP, very scared indeed:\n1 The NHS\nPublic services, especially the NHS, are in the firing line. One of the main aims of TTIP is to open up Europe’s public health, education and water services to US companies. This could essentially mean the privatisation of the NHS.\nThe European Commission has claimed that public services will be kept out of TTIP. However, according to the Huffington Post, the UK Trade Minister Lord Livingston has admitted that talks about the NHS were still on the table.\n2 Food and environmental safety\nTTIP’s ‘regulatory convergence’ agenda will seek to bring EU standards on food safety and the environment closer to those of the US. But US regulations are much less strict, with 70 per cent of all processed foods sold in US supermarkets now containing genetically modified ingredients. By contrast, the EU allows virtually no GM foods. The US also has far laxer restrictions on the use of pesticides. It also uses growth hormones in its beef which are restricted in Europe due to links to cancer. US farmers have tried to have these restrictions lifted repeatedly in the past through the World Trade Organisation and it is likely that they will use TTIP to do so again.\nThe same goes for the environment, where the EU’s REACH regulations are far tougher on potentially toxic substances. In Europe a company has to prove a substance is safe before it can be used; in the US the opposite is true: any substance can be used until it is proven unsafe. As an example, the EU currently bans 1,200 substances from use in cosmetics; the US just 12.\n3 Banking regulations\nTTIP cuts both ways. The UK, under the influence of the all-powerful City of London, is thought to be seeking a loosening of US banking regulations. America’s financial rules are tougher than ours. They were put into place after the financial crisis to directly curb the powers of bankers and avoid a similar crisis happening again. TTIP, it is feared, will remove those restrictions, effectively handing all those powers back to the bankers.\n4 Privacy\nRemember ACTA (the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement)? It was thrown out by a massive majority in the European Parliament in 2012 after a huge public backlash against what was rightly seen as an attack on individual privacy where internet service providers would be required to monitor people’s online activity. Well, it’s feared that TTIP could be bringing back ACTA’s central elements, proving that if the democratic approach doesn’t work, there’s always the back door. An easing of data privacy laws and a restriction of public access to pharmaceutical companies’ clinical trials are also thought to be on the cards.\n5 Jobs\nThe EU has admitted that TTIP will probably cause unemployment as jobs switch to the US, where labour standards and trade union rights are lower. It has even advised EU members to draw on European support funds to compensate for the expected unemployment.\nExamples from other similar bi-lateral trade agreements around the world support the case for job losses. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada and Mexico caused the loss of one million US jobs over 12 years, instead of the hundreds of thousands of extra that were promised.\n6 Democracy\nTTIP’s biggest threat to society is its inherent assault on democracy. One of the main aims of TTIP is the introduction of Investor-State Dispute Settlements (ISDS), which allow companies to sue governments if those governments’ policies cause a loss of profits. In effect it means unelected transnational corporations can dictate the policies of democratically elected governments.\nISDSs are already in place in other bi-lateral trade agreements around the world and have led to such injustices as in Germany where Swedish energy company Vattenfall is suing the German government for billions of dollars over its decision to phase out nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Here we see a public health policy put into place by a democratically elected government being threatened by an energy giant because of a potential loss of profit. Nothing could be more cynically anti-democratic.\nThere are around 500 similar cases of businesses versus nations going on around the world at the moment and they are all taking place before ‘arbitration tribunals’ made up of corporate lawyers appointed on an ad hoc basis, which according to War on Want’s John Hilary, are “little more than kangaroo courts” with “a vested interest in ruling in favour of business.”\nSo I don’t know about you, but I’m scared. I would vote against TTIP, except… hang on a minute… I can’t. Like you, I have no say whatsoever in whether TTIP goes through or not. All I can do is tell as many people about it as possible, as I hope, will you. We may be forced to accept an attack on democracy but we can at least fight against the conspiracy of silence",

However, a critical analysis reveals that our current approach to education, particularly in pushing every young person towards conventional academia, might not be the best path forward. The YouTube video “We are failing young people en masse” sheds light on the pressing issues surrounding education and the need for a transformation in how we guide young individuals towards their futures.\nThe Burden of Traditional Education\nIn the video, the speaker expresses concern about the prevailing culture that encourages young people to enrol in university courses, resulting in a lifetime of debt without necessarily equipping them adequately for the workforce. The burden of student loans, framed as an additional tax, can be overwhelming when viewed over a lifetime. The emphasis on traditional university education might not always align with the practical needs and aspirations of young individuals.\nRethinking the Pathways: RQF vs Traditional Degrees\nAn alternative presented is the Recognition of Prior Learning (RQF), a modular form of study that allows individuals to attain qualifications while working. Unlike conventional degrees where changing courses often leads to wasted time and debt, the RQF’s modular structure permits flexibility. It enables learners to switch courses without losing previously earned credits, providing a more adaptable and less financially burdensome approach to education.\nDiverse Skills and Aptitudes\nThe video challenges the academic-centric approach that forces every young person into the same mould. It highlights the importance of recognising diverse skills and aptitudes, which may not necessarily conform to the traditional academic route. For instance, it praises the practical skills exhibited by young individuals who might excel in areas like mechanics, plumbing, or other crafts, emphasizing that these skills deserve encouragement and support.\nNurturing Individual Talents\nInstead of coercing young people into academic paths they have no interest in, the video urges a shift in attitude. It advocates for nurturing individual talents and interests from an early age, allowing individuals to pursue careers aligned with their skills rather than conforming to societal expectations.\nBuilding a Supportive Society\nMoreover, the speaker calls for a societal shift from a self-serving mentality to one where experienced individuals support and guide younger generations. This transition from an ‘I’m all right, Jack’ mindset to a more collaborative and supportive approach fosters a fairer and more equitable society.\nA Call for Change\nIn conclusion, the video serves as a powerful call to rethink our education system and our perceptions of success. It challenges us to reconsider the value we place on conventional academia and encourages a more inclusive approach that recognises and supports diverse skills and career paths.\nFinal Thoughts\nUltimately, the key lies in providing opportunities that align with individual strengths and aspirations. It’s imperative to create a society where success isn’t solely measured by academic achievements but also by the diverse contributions and skills individuals bring to the table. This reimagined educational landscape can pave the way for a more just and supportive society for generations to come.\nThe video provokes thought and encourages viewers to reflect on the current educational paradigms and the opportunities we provide for our young people. It’s a conversation starter aimed at reshaping our approach to education, offering a more inclusive and empowering environment for the next generation.\nLet’s engage in this conversation and work towards creating a more diverse, equitable, and supportive educational ecosystem for our youth.\nWhat are your thoughts on this? How do you envision the future of education and opportunities for young people? Your insights and perspectives are invaluable in shaping this crucial discussion.\nThank you for reading. Looking forward to your contributions and perspectives.",

This revelation has cast a shadow over Labour’s economic strategy and raised questions about the sustainability of their current fiscal approach.\nThe warning comes in the wake of the Chancellor’s inaugural Budget, which already introduced a substantial £40 billion tax increase—a measure Labour had initially characterised as a singular emergency intervention. However, the mounting economic pressures may force their hand towards additional revenue-raising measures.\nIn a particularly forthright interview with Times Radio, Mr Johnson outlined a rather bleak economic forecast. “Whilst I’m not anticipating an immediate recession, the Government faces an extraordinarily challenging set of decisions,” he explained. “The upcoming spending review this summer will present them with perhaps their most difficult choices yet, and I suspect we’ll see numerous disgruntled Cabinet ministers when they discover the severe limitations on departmental funding.”\nHe added, “Should economic growth fail to materialise as hoped, there’s a distinct possibility that the Chancellor might need to seek additional funding sources come autumn. This creates an impossible dilemma—either raise taxes further to adequately fund public services, or accept that without economic growth, public services will face disappointing shortfalls in resources.”\nThe business community has already expressed mounting concern regarding Labour’s recent policy decisions. Their anxiety centres particularly on the increased employer National Insurance contributions, comprehensive reforms to workers’ rights, and the elevation of the minimum wage. These measures have created a perfect storm of challenges for British businesses already grappling with economic uncertainty.\nRecent findings from the Confederation of British Industry paint a troubling picture, with employers anticipating both price increases and workforce reductions in the approaching quarter. This gloomy outlook was further reinforced by an Institute of Directors survey, which revealed business leader confidence had plummeted to its lowest point since the initial COVID-19 lockdown.\nThe Bank of England’s Governor, Andrew Bailey, recently highlighted how post-Budget uncertainty was actively hampering economic recovery and complicating decisions around interest rate reductions. This observation gained additional weight following Monday’s unexpected data revision from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe revised figures showed that GDP had remained completely flat during the July-to-September period, contrary to the previously reported modest growth of 0.1 percent. With the economy subsequently contracting by 0.1 percent in October, Britain now teeters on the edge of a technical recession, traditionally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\nPerhaps most concerning for Labour’s economic credentials is the decline in living standards. GDP per capita—a crucial measure of economic wellbeing—fell by 0.2 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, contradicting earlier estimates of stability. This development poses particular challenges for Labour, who entered government with ambitious promises about delivering the G7’s highest per capita growth—a pledge that has since been notably softened.\nMr Johnson offered a measured defence of the new government’s position, suggesting it would be “somewhat unfair” to hold them entirely responsible for the current economic situation. “They inherited an extremely challenging set of circumstances from the Conservative administration,” he noted. “While some of their remedial measures might not have been optimal, they faced genuine constraints in addressing these substantial problems.”\nHe particularly highlighted the recent National Insurance modifications: “The previous government’s reduction in employee National Insurance rates, followed by this government’s compensatory increase in employer contributions, has produced a net negative effect on the economy, at least in the immediate term, by raising the cost of employment.”\nHowever, Johnson didn’t shy away from criticising Labour’s approach, pointing out that their spending commitments outstrip even their substantial tax increases. “We’re witnessing significant spending increases across various sectors—the NHS, the justice system, and beyond. What’s particularly noteworthy is that while there’s considerable discussion about the scale of tax increases, the spending increases are even more substantial.”\nThe situation could become even more precarious if economic growth falls short of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s projected 7 percent over the next four years. Lower growth would inevitably result in reduced tax revenues, potentially forcing the Chancellor to implement additional tax measures to meet fiscal rules and maintain balanced books. This pressure could intensify if Cabinet colleagues push for increased departmental budgets during next year’s spending review.\nAny further substantial tax increases would present an enormous political challenge for the Chancellor, who recently assured business leaders there would be no additional tax rises during this parliament, stating emphatically that she was “not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes.”\nHowever, this position appears to have softened somewhat. While other Cabinet members, including the Prime Minister, notably refused to echo this commitment, Ms Reeves herself seemed to qualify her statement just two weeks later, acknowledging that she “couldn’t write five years’ worth of Budgets in just the first five months of government.”\nNevertheless, she continues to downplay the likelihood of comparable tax increases, maintaining that “This was a once-in-a-parliament Budget that I delivered in October to wipe the slate clean after the mismanagement of the previous government.” Whether this position proves sustainable in the face of continuing economic challenges remains to be seen, as the government grapples with the complex task of balancing fiscal responsibility with economic growth and public service funding.\nKey Economic Implications and Outlook\nThe current economic situation presents several critical challenges for the Labour government and UK businesses. Here are the essential points to consider:\n* The British economy has reached a concerning inflection point, with revised figures showing zero growth in Q3 2024 and a subsequent 0.1% contraction in October, bringing the nation perilously close to a technical recession. This stagnation could have profound implications for government fiscal policy and business confidence.\n* Rachel Reeves’s position as Chancellor faces mounting pressure, as her initial £40 billion tax increase may prove insufficient given current economic trajectories. Despite her earlier assurances of no additional tax measures this parliament, the IFS suggests further revenue-raising initiatives might become necessary if growth continues to underperform.\n* Business confidence has deteriorated significantly, reaching its lowest level since the first COVID-19 lockdown. This decline stems from a combination of factors, including increased employer National Insurance contributions, new workers’ rights regulations, and rising minimum wage requirements, all of which are impacting operational costs and hiring decisions.\n* The Labour government’s ambitious promise to deliver the highest per capita growth in the G7 appears increasingly challenging, particularly given the recent 0.2% decline in GDP per capita. This development could force a substantial recalibration of economic policy and growth targets.\n* The upcoming spending review in summer 2025 will likely present significant challenges, as the government attempts to balance increased public service funding demands against limited resources and potential inflationary pressures. This balancing act could lead to difficult decisions regarding departmental budgets and potential additional taxation measures.\nThe situation remains fluid, with the government’s response to these challenges likely to shape both economic policy and political discourse in the coming months.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_larnaca-salt-lake/content_504.html": "Larnaca Salt Lake is one of the most important wetlands in Cyprus and it has been declared a Ramsar and a Natura 2000 site. It is a complex network of four salt lakes (3 of them interconnected) of different sizes to the west of the city of Larnaca. The largest is lake Aliki, followed by lake Orphani, lake Soros and lake Spiro. They form the second largest salt lake in Cyprus after the Limassol Salt Lake. The total surface area of the lakes adds up to 2.2 km2 and being just off the road leading to Larnaca International Airport is one of the most distinctive landmarks of the area. It is considered one of the most important wetlands of Cyprus.\nIt lies west of Larnaca and consists of a network of four salt lakes, covering a surface area of 2.2 square kilometres – a stone throw from Larnaca International Airport. It is also an area of amazing natural beauty, which has been the natural habitat of sea life for more than 3 million years. In the past, the salt used to be collected on donkeys and stacked up for export but this activity was abandoned in the mid ’80s.\nSalt harvested from this lake used to be one of the island’s major exports, it used to be collected on donkeys and stacked up for export, carried to the edge of the lake, and piled up into huge pyramidal heaps. With rising labour costs harvesting dwindled to a negligible amount and stopped altogether in 1986 as the island now imports most of this commodity\nIn the winter, the lake is the haunt of more than 80 species of migratory birds and an excellent site for bird watching. It is particularly noted for its flamingos which winter on the island. Besides its picturesque beauty, the lake is the haunt of 85 species of water-birds with estimated populations between 20,000–38,000. It is one of the important migratory passages through Cyprus.\nAmong them are 2,000–12,000 flamingos , which spend the winter months there feeding off populations of the brine shrimp. Flocks of birdwatchers gather to observe the blaze of pink from flamingos as they gather in the centre of the lake but also the other important migrants. The Larnaca Salt Lake complex was declared as a protected area by a decision of the Council of Ministers in 1997. Recent evidence suggests that contrary to previous belief the greater flamingo, not only stops over but also breeds on this wetland.\nDuring the winter months the lake fills with water whilst in the summer the water evaporates, leaving a crust of salt and a haze of grey dust. According to legend, the lake’s saltiness stems from St Lazarus’ request of an old woman for food and drink. She refused, claiming her vines had dried up, to which Lazarus replied: “may your vines be dry and be a salt lake forever more.” A more scientific explanation is that the salt water penetrates the porous rock between the lake and the sea, making the water very salty.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-next-property-bubble-in-cyprus/content_634.html": "The Cyprus Mail reported……………..\nCyprus could be inflating another property bubble through the citizenship-by-investment programme, and at a time when such extraordinary policies are no longer necessary, distinguished economist Christopher Pissarides has warned. Now based in London, the 2010 Noble Laureate in Economics tells the Sunday Mail he is monitoring developments on the island and is not sanguine about the economic policies implemented, calling them unsustainable in the long run.\n“It looks like we may be creating another bubble in the property sector. The property market in Cyprus is growing at a rate that’s out of sync with the fundamentals of the economy at large, such as GDP, demand and demographics,” he said.\nAccording to the Rics Cyprus Property Price Index as at June 30, 2018 property prices across Cyprus, on an annual basis flats increased by 7.6 per cent, houses by 4.8 per cent, offices by 11.6 per cent, warehouses by 4.2 per cent and retail by 1.7 per cent. For comparison purposes, GDP growth for 2018 hovered around 4 per cent. Pissarides says the upsurge in demand for property is being driven by artificial factors – a specific government policy, the citizenship-by-investment scheme.\n“Fast-rising property prices and increased construction activity are risky, and not a good sign for the economy, which might be damaged in the future.”\nEssentially, punters are looking not to acquire Cypriot citizenship so that they can live and work on the island, he said. “What they’re after is a European passport. I’m in London now, and I bump into people who tell me they live in the UK but have a Cypriot passport.\n“When I ask them how they got the passport, they say ‘Oh, I bought a house in Limassol’. This whole business reminds me of the sham marriages scheme.”\nOfficial statistics show that during 2018, 4,367 properties were purchased by foreign buyers, of which 1,428 were EU nationals and 2,939 non-EU nationals. Purchases by foreigners accounted for almost half of all sales, which totalled 9,242. According to the latest data released by the Department of Lands and Surveys, in 2018 aggregate sales of property were 6 per cent up on the previous year.\nBut the 6 per cent growth marks a considerable slowing down from the 24 per cent increase recorded in 2017, or the 43 per cent growth in 2016. In December 2018, compared to the same month of 2017, sales fell by 48 per cent.\nIn absolute numbers of property sales, Limassol led the way with 3,411. Is there a property bubble? The jury is still out on that one. George Mouskides, general manager of FOX Property Group, tells the Sunday Mail that the property market in Cyprus normally hovers between 9,000 and 10,000 transactions per year. In this respect, the 9,242 sales contracts filed in 2018 are not out of the ordinary.\nIn fact, the 6 per cent overall rise in transactions is a “healthy increase”, Mouskides said, adding that the market may be correcting after previous years. As for the proportion of foreign buyers, this has indeed been going up since 2013 and the introduction of the citizenship-by-investment scheme. However the apparent surge in foreign buyers from 24 per cent of all sales in 2017 to 47 per cent in 2018 is misleading.\nThe department of lands and surveys has amended its definition of foreign buyers, although it has not explained in what way. The department itself includes a footnote in its statistics cautioning the public that comparisons to 2017 and before are therefore not reliable.\n“I suspect that, if you account for the change in definition of foreign buyers, the percentage of foreign buyers was about the same in 2018 as in 2017,” Mouskides observes.\nOn the ‘sharp’ drop in December 2018 sales (domestic and foreign buyers) compared to December 2017, again a disclaimer is in order. Average property sales stand at about 700 per month. But in December 2017, sales had soared to 1,537. The reason: people were scrambling to buy or transfer property before the VAT came in on January 1, 2018. The December 2017 spike was therefore a one-off, Mouskides explains.\nRegarding prices, again it’s not cut and dry. Rates have shot up in coastal areas, especially Limassol, due to the construction of high-rise buildings. That is because the cost per metre rises the higher up you go. But elsewhere, the small increase in property prices is nothing to write home about. Back to Pissarides who qualifies that, for the time being, the situation appears to be going well.\nBut, he muses, “Let’s say a meeting is convened at the European Commission, and as you know a new EC president is coming in this year. What if the new EC president says they can’t tolerate this passport scheme in Cyprus anymore, that it needs to be curtailed? The bubble will burst instantly.”\nMoreover, in his opinion, at this stage there’s no need for Cyprus to pursue such emergency measures: the economy has come out of recession, the budget is balanced, while the banking system slowly regains the public’s confidence. The absorption of the co-op bank by Hellenic and Bank of Cyprus’ handling of non-performing loans (NPLs) are steps in the right direction, albeit belated.\n“Over the next two years I hope to see a significant decline in NPLs. But in order to restrict NPLs, debtors need to find money. And the only way for them to find the money is for the economy to rebound. If that happens, all well and good, the banking system will be on a sound footing.\n“OK, but what happens next? People will start seeking loans to start up businesses. But where will these investments be made? This is what matters. The supply of loans has to be matched by demand.”\nIn short, Pissarides says that Cyprus needs a plan going forward.\n“There’s many little things we can do, but frankly it’s beating about the bush. If you want real reform, you have to go the heart of the problem. And the core problem is the public sector and how it serves the private sector.”\nThe top priority should be to reform the public sector. This takes many forms: cutting red tape generally, proper enforcement of the law, expediting registrations for companies, making courts more efficient so that commercial disputes don’t take years to resolve as they do now. All the above would encourage not only locals to invest in new businesses, but also foreign corporations to choose Cyprus as their base.\n“There is much that needs to be done, but there are obstacles in the way. Privatising the state telecoms and power companies is a must, but the government seems to have walked back on its intention to do so, faced with opposition from the unions.\n“And even where the government does show determination to press ahead with reforms, these stumble on resistance from parliament.”\nAsked to grade the government, Pissarides offers: “Top marks on the fiscal side, but bottom marks on reform.”\nCOMMENT\nCyprus has been participating in actually selling EU citizenship, which is not only immoral, but it is to the detriment of Cypriot nationals who are finding themselves in the middle of a ridiculous property bubble that is leaving them unable to afford a home. What makes it worse is that the people who are ‘Parking their ill gotten gains’ in Cyprus, DO NOT have nexus with Cyprus, they do not have any loyalty to Cyprus, nor do they care about the tragic side-effects of their actions.\nWe now have a situation where overseas investors are actually investing in developments to sell on to other overseas investors, further inflating prices and there is no benefit to local people throughout this process whatsoever. Cyprus is a small island that does not have hundreds or even dozens of cities for people to move to, so the hardship continues, while the small number of beneficiaries at the top profit from their misery.\nTHIS HAS TO STOP………..IT IS IMMORAL!",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_benefits/content_487.html": "Benefits\nThe benefits system is broken. There are 5.3 million people in Britain on out of work benefits. Around 3.7 million of these are not required to look for a job for health reasons. A substantial number are under 34 years of age. This number soared when face to face health checks were replaced by remote assessments.\nWe want an efficient welfare system that helps the genuinely disabled, sick, vulnerable and unemployed to find work. Currently our benefits system encourages dependency and entitlement. This damages mental health, locks people into poverty and wastes talent. Low pay and high tax means many can earn more on benefits than in work. Meanwhile nearly a million job vacancies are unfilled. If you can work you must work. There are too many shirkers and skivers while many with disabilities work hard and pay tax.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nMake Work Pay.\nLifting the income tax start point to £20,000 per year means an extra £1,500 per year. This would be a key incentive for those on benefits to find work.\nStart to Motivate up to 2 Million People Back to Work.\nReforms to benefit support & training will help people back into work. Particular focus on\n16-34 year olds. Employment is critical to improving mental health. Tax relief for businesses that undertake apprenticeships.\nEnforce a 2-Strike Rule for Job Offers.\nAll Job seekers and those fit to work must find employment within 4 months or accept a job after 2 offers. Otherwise benefits are withdrawn.\nFace to Face, Not Remote Assessment for Personal Independence Payment. Human contact is critical to build relationships and coach people back into work. We will also require independent medical assessments to prove eligibility for payments.\nThereafter:\nIntegrate Mental Health Services with Job Seeking Pathways.\nBritain’s young people are in the grip of a mental health crisis. Work is a cure not a cause.\nStop Benefit Fraud.\nOverhaul anti-fraud practices to ensure the Department for Work and Pensions cut fraudulent benefit claims to negligible levels.\n“All Job seekers and those fit to work must find employment within 4 months or accept a job after 2 offers. Otherwise, benefits are withdrawn.”\nCan you please clarify, are you saying that all job seekers will be offered at least two jobs within 4 months? That sounds great! So in effect, you’re committed to offering every job seeker two jobs within 4 months?\nWhat happens if you fail to offer them a job, will they still be removed within 4 months? I think if that’s the case, that’s very harsh. Many people are simply less recruitable thus may not find a job but not through lack of trying! For example, they may have a relatively minor criminal record from 20+ years back but no one wants to hire them as a result. They may have been out of the job market for so long they lack experience. Likewise, they may not tick the right diversity boxes, lack education, or have a minor health issue that prevents many jobs, but not all.\nTo simply say, “ah well your 4 months are up, we couldn’t offer you a job and you didn’t find one so your benefits are withdrawn” is genuinely disgusting. We would see mass homelessness on a scale unprecedented by people who through no fault of their own fall through the cracks.\nIf you offered these less recruitable people two jobs, and they refused that’s a different matter, but if you cant find them work, and neither can they, are you just going to let them suffer?\nMaybe we should look at changing the lifelong criminal records that prevent many people from getting jobs. Why do we think lifelong criminal records are a good thing? It simply encourages people into a life of crime. They just end up stuck on benefits unable to get hired, even if they are decent people who made a silly mistake. Sure legally no one is allowed to throw away a CV based on a spent conviction, but it always happens.",

With the introduction of new conditions granting the bank the authority to set limits on cash deposits and withdrawals, concerns have been voiced about the increasing push towards a cashless society. This move has ignited debates about the implications of limiting cash usage for consumers, especially those who rely on physical money for their daily transactions.\nThe Power Play\nNatWest’s decision to grant itself what some have called “sweeping new powers” has prompted a wave of skepticism and concern. Current account holders were informed through a leaflet that the bank would now have the ability to establish restrictions on inbound and outbound payments. This includes potentially setting limits on both daily and annual cash withdrawals and deposits, as well as controlling the overall amount of cash that can be transacted.\nFueling the Fears\nThe move has brought to light broader anxieties about the direction in which the banking sector is headed. As the world becomes increasingly digitized and cashless transactions gain ground, many worry that the erosion of the physical currency could negatively impact a significant portion of society. There is a growing realization that the limitations on cash usage could disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with lower incomes who rely on cash for budgeting and financial management.\nThe De-Banking Controversy\nNatWest’s decision to tighten its grip on cash transactions occurs against the backdrop of a larger controversy known as “de-banking.” The spotlight on this issue intensified when former politician Nigel Farage revealed that Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest Group, had closed his account due to differences in political views. This controversy has further fueled concerns about banks wielding immense power over their customers, potentially leading to undue restrictions and discrimination.\nThe Rationale and the Backlash\nNatWest has defended its actions by citing the need to protect customers from fraud risks. The bank insists that this change is not intended to limit access to cash but rather to address financial crime concerns. However, critics remain unconvinced, with Nigel Farage expressing his concerns over banks possessing such authority to curb customers’ cash usage. This apprehension stems from the worry that these powers could be misused, potentially leading to scenarios where customers who hold unpopular views might find their access to cash curtailed.\nThe Way Forward\nIn June, NatWest informed its customers of these impending changes, which are set to take effect on September 11th. The new terms and conditions stipulate that the bank can apply limits to payments based on various criteria, including the risk of fraud or other criminal activities. While efforts to combat money laundering and enhance security are essential, some argue that the transition to a cashless society should be a balanced process, involving consumer consultation and consent.\nConclusion\nThe recent move by NatWest to exert more control over cash transactions has ignited discussions about the trajectory of the banking industry and the potential consequences for consumers. As the world moves closer to a cashless society, concerns about access, discrimination, and the impact on vulnerable groups continue to take center stage. While banks emphasize the need for security and fraud prevention, finding the right balance between safeguarding financial systems and ensuring consumers’ rights is essential to navigate this evolving landscape. Ultimately, the ongoing debates emphasize the need for open dialogue and collaborative decision-making to shape the future of financial transactions.",

Police have said they’ve found no evidence to suggest the suspect has killed anyone else, but investigators are still trying to track down anyone who had been in contact with him online.\nThe army officer, who police haven’t formally identified yet, had been in contact with several of his victims through online chat rooms. He is widely acknowledged to be Cyprus’ first serial killer. The chance discovery of the body of Sierra Grace’s mother, Mary Rose Tiburcio, 38, down a flooded mineshaft on April 14 triggered an investigation that led to the suspect through his online communications with the Filipino woman with whom he had had a six-month relationship.\nThe body of Arian Palanas Lozano, 28, also from the Philippines, was found down the same shaft six days later.\nThe killings took place over 2-½ years starting in September 2016 with the disappearance of 36-year-old Romanian Livia Florentina Bunea, and her 8-year-old daughter Elena Natalia. Their bodies were found inside suitcases at the bottom of a toxic lake that was part of another copper pyrite mine.\nAnother body, believed to belong to Ahita Khadka Bista from Nepal, was found down a dry well in a military firing range. The suspect is due to appear in court Friday, but it’s unclear whether investigators will ask for another custody extension or formally charge him.\nBunea and her daughter will be buried Thursday in a village outside the capital Nicosia. The Cyprus government has said it will cover the funeral and burial expenses of all the victims.",

There is a big problem with stray Cats in Cyprus and many of them are abused, poisoned, shot, run over or they just suffer full stop.\nOn the edge of Larnaca, near the airport, there is an abandoned restaurant next to Tekke Mosque, which seems to have become a dumping ground for Cats. Elias, featured in the video, has been visiting the Cats there for a long time and feeding them, but recently, there were a large number kicked to death and at that point, they decided to take as many as possible to the shelter, even though they were not really ready to operate at that point.\nAnimal lover Susan Antoniou (London) has always been an animal lover and it was her dream to do something about it, then finally last year, she was able to realise her dream, but being the main sponsor of the new sanctuary, which is a few acres of land in a peaceful location, not far from Alethriko. At present, it is little more than several shipping containers joined together, with separate areas inside, for Kittens, Cats with FIV and so on.\nThe entire area is fenced off, but sadly, they got flooded in November, due to torrential rain, which will cost a lot of money to repair. There are obviously large monthly overheads, feeding the Cats, medication etc. This will only increase along with the number of Cats. The shelter is currently being run by Elias and a couple of friends, who devote nearly all their time for free, but it is too much for them alone.\nIn the first instance, they need donations to help with running costs, as well as improvements and additional facilities. Also, they are looking for a generous benefactor or Timber shed manufacturer to donate a few small garden rooms that can be fitted out as sleeping areas for volunteers who may wish to fly over for a few weeks and have some hands on experience looking after the Cats, which is so rewarding.\nWe need a lot of help, as it is in short supply with everything\nI was only there an hour or two and every time I sat down, I was inundated by the fluffy little darlings climbing all over me, it’s actually very dangerous as the risk of falling for one them is VERY HIGH!\nIf you would like to support this wonderful cause, please feel free to contact them directly via their website below, or donate directly with Paypal or even contact them with a view to flying over and spending some time helping out. There is no space on-site yet, but they will invariably find someone to put you up while you are over……so if you fancy spending a few weeks in sunny Cyprus, saving the lives of these gorgeous innocent creatures, please get in touch.\nI’ve seen cats eating bread, chicken bones, fish bones that get stuck in their throats, then die in pain, or cats which are poisoned, drowned, shot, or kicked to death.\nShould you wish to sponsor the sanctuary arrange day visits for Cat lovers, enquire about adopting or anything else, please feel free to get in touch. This really is a wonderful cause and it was a privilege to visit this place, I will be returning on my next trip.\nA few words from Susan…………\n“I started the sanctuary to save all the stray cats because the majority of Cypriots show no mercy and consider them vermin. i would not go to cyprus as i could not bear to see those skinny, sick cats that nobody was interested in, worse still starving to death, searching through bins to find what they could to survive. I’ve seen cats eating bread, chicken bones, fish bones that get stuck in their throats, then die in pain, or cats which are poisoned, drowned, shot, or kicked to death.\nThe government is not interested in the cats, the same thing applies to dogs. i wanted to give them a home. lots of kittens are taken from their mums too early and abandoned at Tekke, which is a popular place for dumping cats and kittens. i wanted to give them a future, to live longer than just a few months, so i decided that rather than walk away, i would do something to save as many as possible, so i bought 5 acres of land to house all the strays.\nI have friends that have done a lot of running around and i cannot thank them enough for the hard work they do every day to save the lives of so many strays. the plan is to rescue, help and neuter stray cats then hopefully find new homes for them. at the shelter they will have access to good food, safety and not be at risk of starving.\nWe need a lot of help, as it is in short supply with everything including food. i can only do so much , what i would really like is to have all the cats in Cyprus to have a good and safe life.”\nSusan – co-founder of the sanctuary\nPLEASE FORWARD ANY DONATIONS TO US VIA PAYPAL\nPaypal Account\ninfo@friendsoflarnacacats.org\nPlease visit out GoFundMe page\nHi, keep in mind that there u have descendants of the Van cat. A registered breed yet a very old one. They originally where found by salt Lake Van, now Eastern turkey. Some are white while others are white and have ginger or tabi on full tale and head. The Van cat can also have two colour eyes. One blue one yellow.\nCheck out Van cat. They r known to like water and can swim, perhaps why there are many around the salt lake of tekke!\nIt s just another way to get adoption for them as they have a breed!\nOf course the Armenians who since ancient times lived around lake van recognise them as the Armenian Van cat, the Turks, the Turkish Van cat and the Kurds of the area, the Kurdish Van cat! A bit like the local coffee! Yet coffe originates from Ethiopia Yemen as the can cat from lake van!!\nSome of the cats have also a coloured spot on their white fur, somewhere on their backs. This is said to be the thumbprint of God or Allah who touched and blessed them as they left Noah’s ark as legend says!!!\nCheck out photos of them on Google. Van cats of lake van or Turkish Van cats….\nI c many there at tekke that are descendants of them! Many are not just ordinary cats but have come from a rare species!!\nI am not for selling or breeding them but all for finding them safe homes where they will be cared for…\nThey may seem like just cats, but many there have a rare history…\nGood luck in finding them homes…\nI wish you well.\nThey may also have a marking on their backs. Legend says that when they left noah s ark, in the area of lake van god or Allah touched to bless them hence the marking on their white backs!\nThey may look like normal cats but they have a historical past.\nThis is not to breed or sell them, as I have noticed many have these markings and are definitely descendants of them but hopefully give them a better chance of finding good homes.\nThe Turks called them Turkish vans, the Armenians Armenian vans and the Kurds of the area Kurdish vans. A bit like coffee here yet it originated first in Ethiopia, Yemen just as the can cat originated in salty lake van!\nI just hope this knowledge finds them good and caring homes…\nAnd the interesting thing is that they are found around the salt lake of tekke. This is how their natural habitat was. Salty lake van is now in Eastern turkey…. Something to do with the mosque also, maybe the cat was brought as a gift, I do not know but they definitely feel at home there…\nThe salty lake has always been their home…\nCheck out Van cats or Turkish Van cats in Google. You can read history, origins and see photos. Especially the white ones with spot colour on their heads and an all colour tail. Spot for the spot on some too!\nGood luck…",

This is the conclusion of the Berlin-based think-tank, the European Council on Foreign Relations, having carried out polls in 14 EU member states. Younger voters, aged 18 to 34, were especially worried about the prospect of war between current EU countries.\nThe belief that the EU will disintegrate within two decades is an entirely rational one. The union bears many of the hallmarks of an empire in decay: it has over-extended its borders; it is attracting more outsiders than it desires or can accommodate; it has too many leaders; it has emerging nativist movements; and its poor are growing ever-more angry and resentful towards the political establishment.\nHowever, the second belief – that war between former nations will ensue – is unfounded. There is no appetite among EU member states for another European conflict, and no signs of animosity between nation states on the continent, as there clearly were prior to 1914 and 1939. The only hostility evident today is directed against the EU and Germany’s leadership itself.\nThe First World War was on the cards ever since 1871, with the unification of Germany, a country that was soon going to dominate the continent as France continued its long decline.\nEver since the Napoleonic wars, Britain had made it policy that no single nation should ever again dominate Europe, and by the 1900s Britain and Germany were in an open naval arms race. There was also by then a general desire for war among the populaces, as personified by the cult of Nietzsche and, as Robert Wohl wrote in The Generation of 1914 (1980), the belief that European culture was decadent and needed ‘purification’.\nThe signs were even more obvious in the 1930s, with Nazi Germany’s re-occupation of the Ruhr, the re-militarisation of the Rhineland, and then the invasion of Czechoslovakia and Poland. By 1936, Orwell observed, it was clear to most that a forthcoming war was inevitable.\nThere are no comparable signs today. If anything, the case is the opposite. The defining aspect of Europe’s nationalist and populist movements is not that they represent growing animosity between nations, but rather that they embody a pan-European alliance among like-minded nationalists. Last Saturday, Matteo Salvini, the Italian populist deputy prime minister, held a rally in Milan attended by leading members of 10 different parties across the continent. One by one they took to the stage to denounce immigration and to denounce Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and the French president Emmanuel Macron as ‘destroyers of Europe’.\nThe real prospect of war on the continent comes not with the disintegration of the EU, but with its continued existence. There may not be any tangible appetite among other EU members for seceding from the Union, but there is clearly something wrong with the model. If it is to survive it will have to become more federated or decentralised or two-tier, otherwise the likes of Salvini or Hungary’s Viktor Orbán will flourish and multiply. But the EU’s ideological leaders are so wedded to ever-closer union that it’s hard to see this happening.\nThe EU made it as difficult as possible for the UK to leave, with the view of setting an example to other members. Any future member that wants to leave, when the decadent and decrepit Union has become more reactionary, centralised and oppressive, and its members even more discontent, may ultimately have to take stronger measures. Remember Yugoslavia.\nMost Europeans believe the EU could fall apart within the next two decades, according to a new study.\nResearch published this week showed that levels of support for membership of the European Union are high – but so is pessimism about the future of the bloc. The survey, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) and YouGov, had more than 60,000 respondents across 14 EU member states.\nIt found that in every member state except Spain, the majority of voters believe the EU will fall apart within the next 10 to 20 years.\nIn France, 58% of respondents said it was realistic that the bloc would collapse within two decades, with 57% of Italian and Polish voters agreeing to that. Even in Spain, 40% of respondents said it was a realistic possibility that the EU could fall apart. The data showed that most Europeans saw the collapse of the single market as the biggest loss should the EU break down, followed by free travel across borders and the freedom to live and work in other countries.\nA European war?\nSignificant proportions of people surveyed also said a war between EU countries was a realistic possibility over the next decade. Austrians were most likely to believe a European war was possible, with 38% saying it could happen within 10 years, followed by 35% of French respondents and 31% of Romanians. The belief was also particularly strong among younger people. In Austria and Romania, half of those aged between 18 and 24 believed a war between EU members was possible, while 46% of the youngest respondents in France agreed.\nAccording to the report, there was a greater tendency to hold this belief among supporters of far-right parties, particularly Rassemblement National in France, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, Jobbik in Hungary, and Golden Dawn in Greece. However, many who supported mainstream parties also thought a European war was possible within 10 years, the study found.\nEconomic split\nAcross all the countries included in the survey, a minority of voters said they believed young people had more economic opportunities than older generations.\nThere was also a widespread insecurity among respondents that they were doing less well financially than people living in other EU nations. In Greece, more than 70% of people felt they had fewer economic opportunities than people in other European countries, while just over half of respondents in Romania, Spain and Italy believed they had an economic disadvantage.\nRespondents in Denmark and Sweden were the least likely to hold the same views.",

The council has purchased a former job centre building, which had long been vacant and fallen into disrepair, as a part of its comprehensive plans to revamp the county town. This bold move marks a pivotal moment in the town’s evolution, promising a brighter future and a vibrant new community.\nFor over a decade, the building had stood neglected, bearing the scars of time. However, it is now set to play a pivotal role in the WNC’s ambitious project to transform the heart of Northampton’s town centre. As the council sets its sights on revitalising the town, the acquired property will not only witness a remarkable physical transformation but also serve as a beacon of change and progress.\nThe Northampton town centre’s metamorphosis will encompass various facets, with the creation of a residential community at the forefront. This visionary endeavour aims to breathe life back into the town’s core, attracting residents, businesses, and visitors alike. The council’s dedication to this mission is palpable, as they look forward to embarking on the subsequent phases of the project, each one designed to elevate the area’s appeal and vitality.\nNestled strategically behind Abington Street and the Grosvenor Centre, the acquired site enjoys a prime location at the heart of Northampton. This central position makes it a focal point for the town’s transformation, symbolising the convergence of its past and its promising future.\nThe acquisition itself was made possible through the Towns Fund, a government initiative designed to empower councils in their endeavours to reshape town centres as part of the broader agenda of levelling up the UK economy. The £475,000 investment in the building’s freehold not only signifies a financial commitment but also underscores the council’s dedication to Northampton’s revival.\nWNC’s town transformation efforts have been greatly bolstered by the infusion of £24.9 million from the Towns Fund. This substantial contribution reflects the government’s belief in the potential of Northampton’s regeneration. The former sites of BHS and Marks & Spencer stores, both of which hold historical significance for the town, are slated for extensive redevelopment. These sites will undergo a remarkable metamorphosis, evolving into modern leisure and retail spaces on their ground floors, while the upper levels will house new homes for the town’s residents.\nReflecting on these exciting developments, West Northamptonshire Councillor Dan Lister affirmed the council’s commitment to creating an environment where both residents and businesses can thrive. This sentiment encapsulates the essence of the council’s ambitious endeavour – to pave the way for Northampton’s resurgence as a hub of prosperity and community vibrancy.\nAs the transformation unfolds, Northamptonians and the wider community can look forward to witnessing the town’s metamorphosis. The acquisition of the old job centre stands as a tangible symbol of the council’s dedication to revitalising Northampton, turning a neglected relic into a cornerstone of progress. With the West Northamptonshire Council at the helm, the town’s future is destined to shine brighter than ever before.",

It was speculated that a legal loophole might be the escape route, enabling the government to block City Hall’s proposals if deemed inconsistent with national policies.\nGB News’ astute political editor, Christopher Hope, revealed recent warnings from government lawyers who cautioned that such legal challenges were likely to fall flat in court. Despite this setback, Number 10 is under growing pressure to intervene before the ULEZ expansion comes into effect on August 29.\nA Downing Street source confided, “We have and continue to look at options but they are limited. The people who could stop this tomorrow are the Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan and Sir Keir Starmer.”\nPreviously touted as a possible antidote, the legal loophole appears to have lost its effectiveness due to concerns of constitutional overreach. As Sunak simultaneously champions air pollution reduction initiatives, blocking a policy that could be aligned with broader government objectives would be seen as conflicting.\nPrime Minister Johnson, fresh from a surprising Tory victory in the Uxbridge & South Ruislip by-election, publicly aligned himself with drivers, vowing to be “on their side.” Yet, his plea extended to Khan as well, urging him to reconsider the ULEZ expansion.\nConservative MPs have joined the chorus, urging Sunak’s government to intensify its efforts to halt Khan’s proposed motorist tax. Craig Mackinlay, a prominent Tory backbencher, called upon the Prime Minister to exercise constitutional power to counteract the unpopular tax. Meanwhile, Buckingham MP Greg Smith highlighted the wide-reaching impact of ULEZ, stating, “It hits my constituents in Buckinghamshire badly, too, just as other counties around London, but we have no say.”\nIn response to mounting criticism, former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan-Smith emphasized the need for concrete evidence of the ULEZ’s environmental impact. He argued that the expansion seemed more like a fundraising endeavor rather than a genuine effort to improve the environment. “I’m up for anything the Government can do to stop this nightmare taking place,” he affirmed.\nHowever, ULEZ’s scope extends beyond political sparring, as concerns arise about the potential health impact on children. Professor Chris Griffiths of Queen Mary’s primary care was approached by London Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy Shirley Rodrigues to reconsider his study’s conclusions, which did not establish definitive evidence of health benefits for children’s lungs.\nWith the ULEZ expansion looming and tensions running high, the Department for Transport has put the onus on Mayor Khan to justify the expansion, especially in light of the government’s efforts to ease the cost of living for the public. The debate continues to escalate as London inches closer to the August 29 deadline, leaving the city at the crossroads of environmental responsibility, policy implications, and public sentiment.",

The legal action, led by five conservative-led councils, questions the rationale behind the scheme’s extension throughout the entire city, starting from the end of August. However, it’s important to note that ULEZ schemes are not limited to London, as similar initiatives exist in Glasgow, Derby, Bristol, and Birmingham, each with their own daily charges. This blog post delves into the ongoing judicial review and the concerns surrounding the ULEZ expansion plans.\nDay One at the High Court:\nYesterday marked the commencement of the two-day judicial review process, where the initial arguments were presented. Howard Cox, the founder of Fairfield UK, shared his experience attending the court proceedings. While admitting that such hearings can be tedious, he highlighted the significant turnout and absence of the press. Cox pointed out that the conservative councils, who initiated the legal action, aimed to challenge the ULEZ extension based on the procedural aspects of the decision-making process.\nUnderstanding Judicial Reviews:\nTo shed light on the matter, it’s crucial to understand the purpose of a judicial review. Its objective is to determine whether a decision-making process was irrational or based on flawed reasoning. Cox drew upon his involvement in a judicial review against the government’s decision to administer COVID-19 vaccines to children. In this case, as well, the burden lies in proving that the decision lacks a rational basis and fails to align with the available evidence.\nEvidence and Public Consultation:\nCox highlighted the significance of evidence in the ongoing review. He pointed to the previous year’s public consultation, which revealed that two out of three respondents disagreed with the extension of ULEZ. Notably, around 5,000 supporters of Fairfield UK participated in the consultation. However, their responses were counted as a single response, disregarding the vast number of opposing views. This discrepancy in the process raises concerns about the legitimacy of the decision-making process.\nThe Impact of ULEZ Expansion:\nOne of the major concerns associated with the ULEZ expansion is its potential burden on individuals and businesses. Cox emphasized that the additional charges, such as the daily fees in London (£12.50), Birmingham (£8), and Bristol (£9), could have adverse effects on low-income families, small businesses, and white van drivers. He also highlighted the significant amount of fines collected from the existing ULEZ implementation, amounting to £400 million within 18 months.\nFuel Watchdog Campaign:\nShifting the focus, the discussion turned to the efforts of Fairfield UK in advocating for a Fuel Watchdog. For the past five years, Cox has championed the cause, urging for a regulatory body to monitor fuel prices. Unlike other consumer goods, fuel prices often experience discrepancies and lack transparency. Cox referenced instances where petrol stations were found to overcharge consumers by 6 pence per litre, resulting in millions of pounds of additional costs. Recognizing the need for such oversight, Cox praised recent acknowledgement from regulatory authorities regarding collusion and manipulative practices within the fuel industry.\nPolitical Aspirations and Scrapping ULEZ:\nThe conversation shifted towards Cox’s political aspirations. While not standing as a Conservative candidate, Cox explained his decision to run for London mayor under the Reform Party. He cited the lack of a candidate with a proven track record in tackling fuel-related issues and expressed his commitment to addressing concerns such as the ULEZ expansion, low-traffic neighborhoods, and excessive fines. Cox unequivocally stated his intention to scrap ULEZ from day one if elected, highlighting the regressive nature of the tax and its adverse impact on various sections of society.\nConclusion:\nThe ongoing judicial review into Sadiq Khan’s ULEZ expansion plans has sparked debate and raised concerns about the decision-making process. The review aims to determine whether the decision to expand ULEZ lacks rationality and sufficient evidence. The potential impact on individuals and businesses, coupled with the need for fuel price oversight, adds to the complexity of the situation. Meanwhile, Cox’s political aspirations and his promise to scrap ULEZ on day one present an alternative perspective for Londoners to consider in the upcoming mayoral elections.

In this regard, transit-oriented development (TOD) emerges as a promising solution to transform cities into people-oriented urban landscapes. The exclusive “People-oriented Cities” series, brought to you by TheCityFix and Insights, delves deep into this concept, exploring how cities can grow more sustainable and livable through TOD. By focusing on urban design techniques that prioritize people over cars, we can shape cities to foster economic growth, social cohesion, and an enhanced quality of life for all residents.\nMumbai: A Commuter’s Nightmare\nTake Mumbai, India, for example, where the daily commute can be a true nightmare for its residents. The separation between the downtown area and residential core, a vast distance of ten miles, presents a significant transportation challenge. Poor public transport connectivity has resulted in Mumbaikars enduring the longest average daily commute in any Indian city, spending over 47 minutes each way. The fragmented urban development and lack of sustainable transit options have triggered a staggering 3,700% increase in car ownership over the past six decades, leading to congested roads and polluted air.\nNew York City: A Model for Sustainability\nContrast this with the landscape of New York City, where mixed-use development thrives, creating vibrant city blocks that house a diverse mix of restaurants, office buildings, residences, and shops. Such an urban design, known as “mixed-use development,” encourages the use of public transport, walking, and biking, efficiently connecting neighborhoods through sustainable means. As a result, the number of commuters relying on cars in New York City declined significantly, from 90% to 59%, between 2010 and 2011.\nSprawling Cities and Segregation: A Costly Disconnect\nThe rise of sprawling cities can be traced back to the proliferation of zoning at the beginning of the 20th century. This led to the growth of residential neighborhoods on the outskirts and suburbs, creating car-dependent commuter towns. Such urban sprawl has had adverse effects on city centers, giving way to shopping malls instead of bustling commercial streets and segregating the urban poor from the affluent. This trend is especially common in developing nations like Mexico, where single-family houses are scattered on the outskirts of cities, resulting in families spending up to 25% of their income on transportation. The environmental consequences are evident, as Mexico City’s greenhouse gas emissions have surged by up to 70%, and the city loses a staggering USD 2.5 billion each year in economic productivity.\nConnected Communities for a Better Future\nTo combat these challenges, mixed-use development emerges as a potent solution to create inclusive and connected communities. In such areas, residents can access housing, restaurants, services, schools, cultural facilities, and parks within walking or cycling distance, reducing their dependence on private vehicles. An excellent example of this transformation can be seen in Mexico City’s Avenida Insurgentes, a major street that witnessed significant traffic congestion before the introduction of the city’s first bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Metrobús. The launch of Metrobús in 2005 replaced 100,000 daily car trips with sustainable transport, leading to reduced congestion and lower GHG emissions.\nBenefits Beyond Mobility\nIn addition to improved mobility, mixed-use development fosters shared community spaces, such as plazas, parks, and sidewalks, which encourage social interaction and create a sense of belonging among residents. Studies show that neighborhoods with lower levels of car traffic have residents with three times as many friends and twice as many acquaintances compared to heavily trafficked areas.\nFurthermore, mixed-use, public transit-friendly neighborhoods benefit local economies. By reducing the length and number of everyday trips, these areas save individuals money on transportation and eliminate the need for car ownership. Additionally, the increase in foot traffic resulting from mixed-use development supports local businesses, resulting in higher spending by pedestrians compared to car commuters.\nThe Way Forward: Growing Sustainable Cities\nAs the World Health Organization predicts that cities will house 70% of the world’s population by 2050, with 96% of this growth occurring in developing countries, the need for sustainable urban spaces becomes more urgent than ever. As current cities expand and new ones emerge, it is crucial for local leaders, urban planners, and citizens to prioritize sustainable, mixed-use development to reap the economic, social, and environmental benefits of people-oriented cities.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the path to sustainable and livable cities lies in transit-oriented development and mixed-use urban design. By placing people at the center of city planning, we can create communities that are economically vibrant, socially cohesive, and offer an enhanced quality of life for residents. As the world embraces the challenges of urbanization, the lessons from Mumbai and New York City highlight the transformative power of people-oriented cities for a brighter future.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-great-climate-change-agenda/content_927.html": "The Great Climate Change Agenda\nExposing The Self-Serving Scam\nPeople are perishing. Entire ecosystems are in freefall. We find ourselves at the precipice of a mass extinction event, and all you profiteers can prattle on about is money and fanciful tales of perpetual economic growth. How dare you corrupt fear-mongers exploit these vulnerabilities!\nThis is the sordid tale of how an eccentric environmental scare blossomed into a rapacious global racket. “It’s a wonderful business opportunity, okay? You want climate catastrophism, we’ll manufacture climate chaos! There’s an obscene amount of money involved.”\nThis has metastasised into a gargantuan, institutional money-spinning scam. “There are not just billions, but trillions of dollars at stake now.” It reeks of self-interest and insatiable government slush funds. “Careerists like myself, our livelihoods hinge entirely on climate research funding. This is what I’ve been doing for pretty much my entire professional life. They’ll never willingly abandon such a gravy train.”\n“If CO2 isn’t inflicting the cataclysmic impacts we originally claimed it was, how can we possibly remain operational?” Vast numbers have become grievously codependent on perpetuating this ruse. “They’re certainly not going to voluntarily surrender such illicit sustenance.”\nThis is the disturbing tale of science’s debasement. “There’s simply no such climate emergency transpiring on this planet right now. None whatsoever! It’s…there’s utterly no evidence of one!” The climate alarm is utter poppycock, you know. “It’s a hoax. I’ve never been partial to ‘hoax’ as a descriptor. I find ‘scam’ a rather more apposite term, but I’m willing to settle for ‘hoax.'”\nIt’s a narrative rife with the bullying and intimidation of any who dare challenge the climate alarm orthodoxy. “To voice even mild scepticism about climate change was essentially career suicide.” Radical environmentalists are even advocating for criminalising any dissent whatsoever.\nThis is the story of an audacious assault on individual liberty. “It’s such a propitious pretext for expanding government power if there exists some ostensible worldwide existential threat. Well, you’d need an omnipotent, globalized government authority to tackle it. We’re witnessing all these draconian, authoritarian measures being unilaterally imposed under the auspices of ‘saving the planet.'”\nSince the industrial revolution, free market capitalist mass production has enabled an ever-increasing abundance of goods to reach an ever-expanding proportion of the population at affordable prices. Mass consumption has gone hand-in-glove with mass production. In our modern era, ordinary working people are enjoying standards of living unprecedented in human history.\nYet we are ceaselessly lectured that such progress has ravaged the planet. Computer models have purportedly calculated that the weather will only worsen, the planet will boil over, and us rapacious humans must resign ourselves to strict lifestyle limits – consuming less, travelling less. “Those who refuse to accede to the reality of this climate crisis are not merely mistaken…They’re a pernicious danger! Propagating the toxic seed of doubt among a credulous populace. These deviants deserve to be shunned, disgraced and silenced.”\nHowever, the official empirical data and scientific findings paint a markedly contrasting portrait…\nProfessor Steven Koonin, who served as a science advisor to President Obama and was formerly the Vice President of the prestigious Caltech institute, teaches climate science at NYU. “I always instruct my students: scrutinize the datasets and papers for yourselves. They universally emerge from that course with their eyes wide open.” Professor Koonin’s bestselling book “Unsettled” contends that mainstream scientific studies accepted by official agencies fail to substantiate any notion of a climate crisis whatsoever.\n“Of course I’ve been derided as a ‘denier.’ My rejoinder is: precisely what am I denying? I’m quoting verbatim from the official UN scientific reports.”\nDick Lindzen, one of the world’s preeminent meteorologists who served on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), dismisses such hysterical claims. “Even the IPCC’s own Working Group 1 scientific section doesn’t actually validate any of these assertions. I can assure you, having been on it…it’s a biased panel. But you simply couldn’t get any real scientists to endorse some of the nonsense being promulgated.”\nWill Happer, another esteemed American physicist who has advised three presidents, derides the notion that scientific truth is dictated by consensus. “In genuine science, there are always divergent viewpoints, you know. No field is ever ‘settled’ – that’s just absurd, especially for as dynamic a system as Earth’s climate.”\nDr. John Clauser, winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, laments “The science being conducted is appallingly shoddy in my estimation. A sizable number of scientists vehemently dissent from the standard climate change position. They refer to themselves as ‘skeptics.’ Since I no longer need to appease funding bodies or employers…I openly self-identify as a ‘climate change denier.'”\nThese distinguished, elite scientists are not unhinged conspiracy theorists or anti-science cranks. So what evidence has prompted their dismissal of climate catastrophism’s wild-eyed assertions?\nWe are continually admonished that present temperatures are unprecedentedly and perilously high. However, we possess extensive physical evidence of Earth’s climatic history spanning millions upon millions of years which enables us to evaluate such claims.\nIn Israel’s Judean Desert near the Dead Sea, Professor Nir Shaviv has uncovered geological clues that undermine such feverish prophecies of climatological calamity. “Thousands of years ago this place was submerged under water, and etched into the rocks are stratified historical climate records if you understand how to interpret them. These fossilized lakebeds chronicle how the climate has oscillated over time.”\nPoring over these sedimentary deposits elucidates past eras of abundant aquatic life whenever the climate was warmer. Geologists can discern previous climatic conditions through various other techniques, Shaviv elaborates. “We can examine stalagmite growth rings in caves, drill oceanic sediment cores or examine other stratigraphic evidence. But here, I believe, offers one of the most visually comprehensible illustrations of climatic fluctuations through the ages.”\nThe paleoclimate data reveals that for nearly 200 million years when dinosaurs roamed, at no point were global temperatures as frigid as today’s. “If you go back 200 million years, it was around 13°C warmer on average than present. From a geological perspective, this isn’t unprecedented at all.”\nIn fact, over the past half-billion years, our planet has experienced far higher temperatures for the overwhelming majority of that period compared to today. “We’re in a remarkably cool era right now if we look back over the past 550 million years. There was only one other comparably cold period in that span.”\nThe epoch when mammals first evolved some 60 million years ago was considerably warmer than modern times. “Any interval within the last 65 million years was warmer than it is essentially today.” It appears mammalian species, humans included, thrive in warmer climatic conditions compared to the present.\n“There’s no doubt that geologically, warmer has proven better than cold. We are a tropical species whose African evolutionary origins conditioned us for a hot climate. A human being exposed naked to just 20°C would succumb to hypothermia.”\nOver the past 50 million years, eventually culminating in our current ice age, global temperatures have steadily declined into this unprecedentedly chilly period. “We’re at the tail end of a 50 million year cooling trend, yet they’re claiming it’s too hot!”\nExamining temperature patterns over just the past few million years reveals them plunging between alternating episodes of extreme glaciation when the planet was largely frozen over, and slightly milder interglacial periods with only polar ice sheets.\nFor the past 10,000 years, humanity has been graced with one of these relatively benign interglacial periods known as the Holocene. “With weather moderating, humans finally emerged from their caves. Several thousand years ago, we witnessed the rise of the first great civilizations amidst this blissful Holocene Climatic Optimum when temperatures were toastier than today’s.”\nSince then, temperatures have cooled and fluctuated in cycles. “During Roman times, there was a balmy warm period, followed by a bitterly cold spell and the Dark Ages. Then came the pleasantly temperate Medieval Warm Period, according to many studies as warm or warmer than today, followed by the particularly brutal Little Ice Age which may have been the coldest of the past 10,000 years.”\nThe longest instrumental temperature record in the world hails from central England, plainly depicting this pattern. “Since the nadir of the Little Ice Age around 1650, it shows warming of little over 1°C. This central England dataset, one of the world’s most treasured climate records, exhibits no alarming temperature signal whatsoever as it climbs out of the Little Ice Age depths.”\nPutting that roughly 1°C increase into perspective, let’s examine New York City’s Central Park. Records indicate no overall temperature change since 1940, yet the annual average can still vary by 3°C between years without much notice. In fact, the spread between the hottest year in the 1960s and the coolest in 2000 was fully 5°C.\n“So when I hear these hysterics pontificating that 1.5°C of warming will precipitate civilization’s collapse, I can only wonder what narcotics they’ve ingested. Are you utterly deranged?”\nAccording to the instrumental global temperature dataset since 1880 commonly cited by officialdom as demonstrating dangerous anthropogenic warming, there has only been a very mild degree of temperature increase. And that seemingly dramatic upward trend line only manifests as such through deceptive compression of the Y-axis scale.\nBut is that widely-touted record even accurate? Professor Ross McKitrick, an expert statistician at the University of Guelph, found something highly irregular in the modern surface temperature records. Thermometers, even in close regional proximity, can register starkly divergent readings depending on their exact locations.\n“I was interested in understanding what dictated this uneven patchwork of warming – why some areas warmed significantly while others barely budged. It transpired there was a tight correlation between the spatial pattern of warming and that of industrial economic activity. Areas with greater human activities registered more waste heat signatures.”\nThis is the well-known Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. “The UHI effect is essentially London, right? Pick any major city like London with its proliferation of buildings and [human] activities, and you’ll find it reading several degrees Celsius warmer than the surrounding countryside. This is an unavoidable byproduct of urbanization.”\nThe UHI effect is starkly illustrated in urban heat maps like one depicting Paris, whose core can be up to 5°C hotter than its outskirts. “Paris, London, Beijing, Shanghai, New Delhi…you name it, they all unmistakably demonstrate these UHI effects, often with the obvious culprit being heat-absorbing concrete and asphalt surfacing.”\nSo how has the inexorable spread of urbanization skewed the official temperature records? “In the early 20th century, it was standard practice to locate weather stations just outside of towns – close enough for convenient daily readings, but still avoiding the urban heat sink. But over the course of the 1900s, those very towns became enveloped by mushrooming suburban sprawl.”\n“Suddenly all these once-rural thermometer locations found themselves encompassed by shopping malls, office buildings, factories, homes…you name it. Towns and the areas housing thermometers on average grew vastly in population since 1880. So you have all these non-climatic influences like concentrated buildings and paved surfaces heating up those temperatures.”\n“To properly monitor global temperature trends, you really need to correct for this data corruption by focusing exclusively on rural weather stations insulated from urban development.” This has now been done by a team led by Dr. Willie Soon.\n“We aggregated all the best rural stations, applying whatever corrections were possible. When you only rely on rural datasets uncontaminated by urban heat sources, you get a starkly divergent picture of recent temperature changes.”\nAccording to rural stations, the temperature rose from the 1880s until peaking around 1940. It then endured a marked cooling phase until the 1970s, after which it rebounded without ever replicating the high temperatures of the 1930s/1940s peak.\n“Essentially you have a warming surge from the 1900s into the 1930s/1940s, then substantial cooling until around 1976, followed by warming but still below the prior peak. There’s a hallmark 50-60 year cycle, not some continuous upward trend.”\nMaritime temperature measurements taken from shipborne sensors deployed since the 19th century corroborate the lack of modern warming reflected in the rural datasets. “While the land records in red depict accelerating warming from around 1900, the ship-based oceanic temperatures in blue show nowhere near that degree of warming over the 20th century. You’d expect the oceans to remain insulated from urban heat contamination.”\nArboreal experts studying millennial-aged tree ring growth chronologies have similarly failed to detect any remarkable present-day warming. “You see that same gentle warming progression until mid-century followed by cooling into the 1970s, then some recovery – but still barely differing from the 1930s/1940s temperatures. It all aligns with the rural station records.”\nSatellite monitoring has provided the most accurate and comprehensive global temperature readings yet from the 1980s onward. Dr. Roy Spencer, former senior scientist for climate studies at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, was a pioneer in developing this innovative satellite observational method along with his colleague Dr. John Christy.\n“Our first complete globally-integrated satellite temperature dataset originated in January 1979 and continues unbroken through to the present,” Spencer clarifies. “It enabled us to conclusively determine whether the perceived warming trends on the surface were legitimate or simply an artefact of expanding urbanization.”\n“And what we consistently found, especially in urban areas, is a strikingly large conflating urban heat signature creeping into the surface thermometer data! Since 1880, most of the warming seems to derive from the Urban Heat Island effect.”\nSpencer expresses his gratitude that these two climate scientists have provided an unadulterated, independently-derived temperature record to counterbalance the heavily-massaged surface datasets embraced by global agencies.\n“We’re fortunate to have a few independent-minded scientists like John Christy and Roy Spencer with their trustworthy satellite monitoring of atmospheric temperatures. Before they started releasing this, the ground-based temperature records were going wild with no restraint. Now at least they’ve been obliged to reconcile with this independent, almost certainly more accurate means of gauging planetary temperature trajectories – which are by no means alarming.”\nThe statistical evidence from multiple lines of empirical enquiry – satellite monitoring, weather balloon measurements, isolated rural temperature stations, maritime sea surface records, borehole reconstructions – all converges to invalidate the notion of an inexorable, catastrophic, anthropogenic warming pattern over the past 120 years.\nThe instrumental temperature datasets marketed as apocalyptic by official bodies, government agencies and mainstream media outlets have been artificially exaggerated and contaminated due to unvented urban heat emissions.\n“You examine the radiosonde [weather balloon] records, the satellite records, the pristine rural station records, the maritime ship measurements…they all demonstrate this stark inflection where the rapidly warming trend pervades in the Northern Hemisphere’s urban-influenced land records, where most of the thermometer data contamination originates.”\nEven if we extend the excessive benefit of the doubt and accept the compromised surface temperatures at face value, that mild warming signal still underperforms the predictions of computerized climate models produced at staggering taxpayer expense over recent decades.\nAs Professor John Christy elucidates, “There are now dozens of climate models that have been intensively developed over decades at a cost of billions, maybe tens of billions, of dollars. Yet we consistently find that virtually all generate too much projected warming over this period since 1979 up to the present relative to the real-world observations.”\n“Even if we accept the controversial surface temperature data, this still doesn’t produce the extreme warming that most of the climate models insist should have occurred, let’s say over the past 50 years. The models, individually and collectively, whether averaging their ensembles or examining them separately, are plainly wrong! They fail to replicate what we empirically observed.”\nAtmospheric physicist Dr Richard Lindzen concurs, “You can already see that the primary scaffolding underpinning the climate catastrophism movement – those enormous, elaborate computerized climate models – are fundamentally flawed! They simply don’t align with observed realities. They don’t accurately reproduce geographical temperature distributions, ENSO [El Nino/La Nina] cycles…it’s all just nonsensical gibberish. Every last one of those models runs way too hot.”\n“I contend there is no connection whatsoever between CO2 and climate shifts. It’s all a crock, a complete scam in my view. There is no validity to the notion that current temperatures are hotter than the Earth experienced in the past. That’s a lie. There’s no truth that atmospheric CO2 concentrations now have exceeded safe bounds. That’s another lie.”",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_immigration-will-not-solve-the-decline-in-population/content_983.html": "Immigration will not solve the decline in population\nImmigration and Population Decline\nThe Age of Mass Immigration\nThe movement of people over geographic distances is certainly nothing new. However, the pace, scale and form it has recently taken is groundbreaking, changing the economic, social and cultural realities of the world as we know it.\nSeveral things have changed in the past couple of decades. First is the demographic imbalance that has emerged between the developed and the developing worlds. In the past half century, certain parts of the planet experience massive population growth that outstrips their possible economic growth. Thus there is a seemingly inexhaustible source of people without sufficient prospects in their home countries, which creates population pressure and incentivises mass emigration.\nWhile in the past migrants usually moved over relatively short distances, the technological developments caused by industrialisation have made the world much smaller. Motor vehicles, air travel and motorboats allow people to cross distances that would earlier be uncrossable. The spread of the internet and smartphones made it even easier to navigate the world and share information.\nThe poor areas of the world can also see the riches of the wealthy countries on the internet, incentivising them to try and make the journey. People from continents away are now able to move over the globe in their pursuit of a better life. The migration from neighbouring lands has also accelerated.\nA profound cultural revolution also took place within the Western world. The paradigm of the debate about the cultural impacts of immigration has slowly but completely changed. Immigration from basically anywhere became culturally normalised in countries that previously were colonial empires.\nMass Immigration in Post-WW2 Period\nIn the period after World War II, many Western European countries experienced labour shortages due to rebuilding efforts and wartime losses. The post-war baby boom replenished the populations which returned to natural growth. While in the post-war decades population problems were not a major factor, since the 1970s as fertility declined, immigration increasingly gained prominence.\nMass immigration into the developed world did not start as an attempt to replenish aging and declining populations, but now it is a prominent justification. Countries need to import people born elsewhere to support further economic growth or replace retirees.\nMost developed Western countries now have between 15-30% foreign born populations. The economic rationale for immigration is increasing even as public opinion grows more anti-immigration and potential sources narrow.\nThe Unsustainability of Using Immigration to Address Low Fertility\nImmigration is like a drug for the economy. A country reaches a level of wealth where native populations become unwilling to perform certain jobs, often ones that are critical for basic sectors like agriculture, construction, healthcare, warehouse work and manufacturing.\nCountries that are dependent on foreign labour, like the oil monarchies of the Persian Gulf where foreigners make up 70% of the population, would likely collapse without immigrant workers.\nIn Western Europe, german-speaking countries have the worst demographics and highest immigrant populations. The anglophone settler countries like Australia, New Zealand and Canada are also very high.\nImmigrants tend to concentrate in the 20-55 age bracket, so they help address immediate labour shortages. However, immigration is not a real solution, only a temporary fix. It does not remove the underlying cause of sub-replacement fertility. The immigrants themselves will eventually retire and need to be supported. It is like a Ponzi scheme that can only keep moving with endless new people coming in.\nThere is a black hole at the center of the system. Unless fertility increases, the need for foreign labor will never cease.\nThe Developed World’s Demographic Transition\nThe developed world has experienced a demographic transition to low fertility over the past half century. Meanwhile, parts of the developing world are still undergoing this transition. This had led to a profound imbalance.\nIn the past, migrants moved shorter distances, often between neighbouring states. Now geographical mobility allows movement between continents. The world is much more interconnected.\nPreviously, Western countries represented the bulk of the developed world. For example, in 1950 almost 1/3 of the world’s population lived in Europe and North America. Today that share has declined significantly as other parts of the world have developed.\nMass immigration has changed the cultural, economic and social realities of receiving countries. The pace and scale is unprecedented. Although immigration has always happened throughout history, what we see today is fundamentally different.\nDealing with the Core Issue\nImmigration provides a temporary patch, but does not address the core issue driving it – low fertility. As long as fertility remains below replacement level, the need for immigrant labor will persist or grow. The demand will increase over time rather than decrease.\nSome see technology and automation as potential solutions. But historically, new technologies have not decreased labor demand, merely shifted the needed skills. Bringing in foreign labor will still be required.\nTo simply accept decline is also not desirable. The world of shrinking populations would not be a positive one. Capitalism in particular may struggle without the expectation of growth. Alternatives like feudalism are not appealing.\nGovernments seem resigned to low fertility and see it as unchangeable. But is that really true in the long run? The universality of low fertility points to systemic issues that could potentially be influenced over decades with massive effort.\nWe should not be so fatalistic. With climate change, Western civilization is willing to make major sacrifices to ensure sustainability. A similar long-term effort will be needed to reach sustainable fertility levels. But it is doable if we commit to it.\nThere are no easy answers. Hungary has implemented extensive pro-natal policies, with limited success so far. But it is foolish to expect instant results from policy changes. We need sustained, gradual efforts to shift social values and economic incentives around fertility.\nHousing affordability, economic incentives for childbearing, pension system changes – many options should be tried, tweaked and expanded or discontinued based on results. Different countries may require tailored solutions.\nIt will not be simple and there may be economic pain in the transition. But indefinitely relying on immigration is unsustainable. We must begin the difficult work of addressing the underlying black hole of low fertility.",

Lammy, in a bold and unanticipated move, proclaimed a comprehensive “reset” of the United Kingdom’s intricate and often tumultuous relationship with the European Union.\nThis proclamation was swiftly echoed and reinforced by none other than the Prime Minister himself, the Right Honourable Sir Keir Starmer KC MP, during a press briefing at the recent NATO Summit. In a statement that has since been scrutinised and debated in political circles across the nation, Sir Keir expressed his fervent hope to recalibrate and reinvigorate Britain’s multifaceted relations with the EU. This ambitious reset, he elaborated, would encompass a wide array of critical issues, ranging from the contentious topic of migration to matters of national and international security, and even extending to the intricate realm of agricultural trade.\nSpeaking with measured enthusiasm at the aforementioned press briefing, Sir Keir expounded on his vision: “What we’re discussing here is nothing short of a fundamental reset of our relations with our European counterparts. I believe that for a great many people in our nation, there has been a pervasive sense in the post-Brexit era that the United Kingdom has become excessively inward-looking, almost isolationist in its stance. This is a perception we must address and rectify with utmost urgency.”\nOn the particularly thorny issue of migration, which has long been a source of heated debate and political discord, Sir Keir has delineated a nuanced and multifaceted approach to tackling irregular migration. Central to this strategy is a concerted effort to clamp down on the nefarious people-smuggling gangs that operate in the shadows, orchestrating and profiting from the perilous journeys of desperate individuals.\nThe Labour Party’s manifesto, a document that has been pored over and analysed by political commentators and citizens alike, outlines an ambitious plan to establish a new Border Security Command. This specialised unit would comprise hundreds of highly trained and experienced professionals, including specialist investigators, cross-border police officers, and intelligence operatives. The primary objective of this new command would be to bolster the nation’s border security and disrupt the operations of criminal networks involved in people smuggling.\nIn a move that has raised eyebrows and sparked debate, the government has announced its intention to reallocate funds that were previously earmarked for the now-scrapped Rwanda policy. These substantial financial resources will instead be channelled towards a more proactive and targeted approach, with the stated aim to “pursue, disrupt, and apprehend those responsible for the vile trade in human lives.” This shift in policy and resource allocation represents a significant departure from the previous administration’s approach to tackling irregular migration.\nDuring the NATO Summit, Sir Keir made another significant announcement that underscores his government’s commitment to addressing the root causes of irregular migration. He revealed plans to allocate a substantial sum of 84 million pounds to initiatives in Africa and the Middle East. This financial commitment is intended to address the underlying factors that drive individuals to embark on perilous journeys in search of a better life, often falling prey to unscrupulous smugglers in the process.\nThe Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, has been particularly active in his efforts to rebuild and strengthen the UK’s relationship with the European Union. Following a series of high-profile diplomatic visits to Germany, Poland, and Sweden, Lammy emphasised that these initial talks were “merely the beginning” of Labour’s concerted efforts to mend and reinvigorate the UK’s relationship with the bloc.\nIn a speech that resonated with many and sparked debate among others, Lammy eloquently stated: “Throughout the annals of history, our individual and national narratives have intertwined to weave a broader tapestry of shared progress and mutual understanding. In the present day, we stand united in our unwavering commitment to the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of international law.”\nHe continued, his words carrying the weight of historical perspective: “The tragic experiences that have marred our continent’s shared past have served as a poignant reminder of how our collective security and prosperity are inextricably linked to these shared values. It is my firm belief that these very values offer a solid foundation upon which we can build an even closer partnership in the years to come.”\nLammy concluded his remarks with a forward-looking statement that has been widely interpreted as a signal of the Labour government’s long-term foreign policy objectives: “My diplomatic engagements this weekend represent merely the initial steps on a long journey. I eagerly anticipate witnessing Britain’s gradual but steady reconnection with our European neighbours in the years that lie ahead. This process of rebuilding trust and fostering cooperation will undoubtedly be a marathon rather than a sprint, but it is a journey we must undertake for the benefit of future generations.”\nAs the Labour Government continues to strengthen its ties with the European Union, questions have inevitably arisen regarding the potential European migration schemes that the UK might be brought into. These questions have sparked intense debate and speculation across the political spectrum and among the general public.\nCritics of the government’s approach have been quick to voice their concerns. One outspoken opponent of closer EU ties stated: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that Sir Keir Starmer intends to sign our nation up to the EU’s resettlement programme for irregular migrants. This programme is Brussels’ ill-conceived answer to its own misguided open border policy, which has created numerous challenges across the continent.”\nThe critic continued, their words tinged with palpable frustration: “Instead of taking decisive action to secure Europe’s borders, irregular migrants will be distributed in quotas to countries across the EU. In essence, Brussels is attempting to legalise irregular migration through the back door, a move that could have far-reaching consequences for our nation and others.”\nFor those unfamiliar with the intricacies of EU policy, the resettlement scheme in question is defined by the European Commission as “the admission of non-EU nationals in need of international protection from a non-EU country to which they have been displaced to an EU country where they are granted protection.” This definition, while seemingly straightforward, belies the complex political and social implications of such a programme.\nUnder the recently announced 2024-2025 EU Resettlement and Humanitarian Admission scheme, a total of 14 EU member states have made commitments to resettle an aggregate of 61,000 individuals. This figure has been the subject of intense scrutiny and debate, with proponents arguing that it represents a compassionate response to global displacement, while critics contend that it could strain social services and integration efforts in participating countries.\nIt’s worth noting that this is not the first time the UK has grappled with the question of participation in EU resettlement schemes. Cast your mind back to 2015, when the then Home Secretary, the Right Honourable Theresa May MP, took a firm stance against British participation in such programmes. May argued vehemently that people should not be incentivised to undertake perilous journeys to Europe, asserting that “this is precisely why the UK will not participate in a mandatory system of resettlement or relocation.” This historical context adds another layer of complexity to the current debate surrounding potential UK involvement in EU migration schemes.\nHowever, it’s crucial to note that Sir Keir Starmer has recently made efforts to clarify his government’s position on this matter. Speaking at the European Political Community summit last week, he categorically ruled out the possibility of a returns agreement with the EU. In no uncertain terms, he stated: “Regarding a returns agreement, I have consistently maintained that we will not be part of the EU scheme. That particular programme is designed for and limited to EU members. We are no longer an EU member state. We have never expressed a desire, made a request, or sought to be part of that scheme, and I can assure you that we have no intention of becoming part of that scheme in the future.”\nAs this complex situation continues to unfold, it is clear that the issue of migration and the UK’s relationship with the European Union will remain at the forefront of political discourse for the foreseeable future. The Labour government’s efforts to reset relations with the EU while maintaining a distinct approach to migration policy will undoubtedly be watched closely by supporters and critics alike. As always, only time will tell how these policies will shape the future of the United Kingdom and its place in the broader European context.\nUrsula von der Leyen told she should go to ‘prison’ by MEP in rant ahead of key vote\nUrsula von der Leyen was confirmed for a second term as European Commission President today – after a lively debate in the European parliament\nUrsula von der Leyen was heavily criticised for her immigration and green policies by a representative of the newest far-right group in the European Parliament.\nEwa Zajączkowska-Hernik, a Polish MEP part of the Eurosceptic and hard right Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN) group, lashed out at Ms Von der Leyen hours before members of the European Parliament held a vote on whether the incumbent European Commission President should retain her role for another term.\nAfter taking the floor, Ms Zajączkowska-Hernik described the first election as president of Ms Von der Leyen as a “huge mistake” before hitting out in an astonishing rant at some of the German politician’s signature policies.\nShe claimed: “You are the face of the European Green Deal, which is destroying the European economy and agriculture, which is leading to Europe becoming an economic backwater.",

I actually intend to make the argument that in many ways, women have become victims of the hard fought battle for the rights that they deserve.\nAs I wrote in another article recently about the Married Women’s Act 1882 just a few weeks ago, on the 18th of August, it was the 140th anniversary of this momentous law, prior to which, married women had absolutely no rights whatsoever, they could not own anything and were simply considered to be possessions of their husbands.\nI’m still shocked that the 18th of August came and went, without so much as a mention. When we look back, 140 years may seem a long time away, but considering that I still remember 1982 like it was yesterday and that was 40 years ago, then 140 is not that far back.\nIt was another thirty six years until women were to win the right to vote in 1918, with the Representation of the People Act 1918, but the criteria was not equal between men and women, until the Equal Franchise Act 1928, when women were finally allowed to vote under the same conditions as men.\nHowever, salaries were a different matter, it was going to be another forty two years until the The Equal Pay Act 1970 ensured that women could not be discriminated on pay in the workplace.\nAt first glance, it may appear that the battle was finally won, but was that really the case? I say not!\nThrough the seventies, women began to see great benefits from the newly acquired independence, earning themselves positions that would not have been possible previously, they were now able to make life-decisions that were based on want, not need. This was all well and good, but by the eighties, things had begun to change, the battle took on a more hostile tone, known as ‘Third Wave Feminism’ it seems that behind the scenes, there were influencers who had were creating divisions and hostility between the genders, rather than equality.\nThere are many arguments for and against the changes in the last three or four decades and I for one am certainly not against anything that would cut the historical mantra of misogyny, but on reflection, I would say that by the nineties, the pendulum had swung too far, the CSA was driving men to suicide, which reached the highest point in history, especially amongst middle-aged men. Perhaps it was time for retribution, perhaps there was good reason for men to be denied the upper hand that they had always had, but there was a price to pay for this.\nAs a consequence of this and other forms of positive discrimination, men began to react by gradually losing their mojo, they have been slipping academically ever since, their focus on achievement has withered and today, we have reached a point where a growing number of men are actually giving up on relationships entirely. This is known as the ‘sexodous’ which is an alarming number of men who have no desire to be in a relationship, let alone marry, preferring to withdraw to their bedrooms with their X-Box and Porn.\nThe flipside of this is that in the modern day, women are for the sake of appearances better off than ever, but I believe that there is a parallel argument that in many ways, life is harder for women than ever.\nWhy is that?\nAs women have become more empowered and men have become increasingly subjugated, socially, legally and professionally, they have gradually absolved themselves from the responsibility of life, just a few decades ago, many men were married with a child at twenty one, taking on the responsibility of a family, how many would even consider that at thirty or even forty nowadays, let alone in their twenties? Sadly, the number is dwindling year on year. Life has become so difficult that the birth rate is collapsing, women are pressured to put career before family in their twenties and thirties, then there comes a time when they feel the natural instinct to have a child, but they then have the arduous task of finding a suitable father, which is no mean feat in the modern world.\nAs a result, many women go it alone, choosing, or having no other alternative but to go ahead and have a child without the support of a family unit, which means that many women in modern Britain have all the pressure of a career, where they more than likely still fee that they need to apply themselves more than the men around them for many different reasons, whilst bearing the full responsibility of being female (assuming I’m still allowed to use this definition that has become increasingly offensive to some) and mothers.\nThere is also one more element to this that I feel is not discussed enough, and that is also a topic that I have previously written about, that is the devastating effects that porn is having on our society, but more seriously, the impact on women.\nIn my article ‘Have you been warped by Pornography’ I discussed the damaging effect that pornography is having on men (women too in many cases) this is not saucy, erotic material any more, that kind that will make us smile, blush or feel amorous, this is aggressive and so influential that it is damaging the minds of men around the world.\nThe real danger here is not just the sexual re-programming of young minds, but the effect it has on their libido, the evidence suggests that where men withdraw with porn for too long, they gradually lose interest in real-life encounters, but more seriously, they also lose the ability to engage in real-life encounters, a condition known as ‘Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction’ which is treated by therapists who help those suffering with this to recover with something called a ‘Sexual Reset’ which is basically the abstention from Porn for a few weeks or months, along with a few other treatments to reset their sexual mindset to normal. However, for young men, the consequences are far more profound, the damage that porn causes to developing minds is far worse, the evidence suggests that where young men indulge in Porn through puberty, the effect of their minds being re-programme by Porn can be permanent, leaving them unable to engage in normal sex with a partner. There are of course many in-between stages, but at the very least, young minds are no longer engaging in a process of innocent discovery, motivated by hormones and attraction, but instead, they enter sexual encounters with a will or need to replicate the degradation that they have become so accustomed to, that the consider it the norm.\nThe other sinister side-effect of this mutation of sexual desire is the worrying increase in sexual attacks on women, which is anything from rape to unhindered violence, with many young girls who would have previously been growing closer to a young man in the natural way, finding themselves treated in the most humiliating and degrading manner, frequently scarring them for life, this is not how the society that we have come so far to create should be, is it?\nI appreciate that this may at first glance appear to be a totally separate topic that bears no relation to the issues that we face as a society at present, especially as we are now in the middle of a cost of living crisis and a serious housing crisis, but I beg to differ, this is yet another tentacle of the beast that seeks to destroy the family unit, communities and society as a whole, breaking us down from a strong collective, in to weak and irrelevant individuals who have no voice, no influence and no alternative other than to pander to those in power.\nIn short, I would like to end with this thought:\nHas society been so focussed on rights for women, (albeit justified) that society has neglected to focus on something equally or even more important, respect for women?",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_sunak-has-lied-about-rwanda/content_521.html": "Sunak has lied about Rwanda\nHave We Been Misled Over Channel Migrants?\nRwanda policy branded a disaster as leaked documents expose truth\nThe situation regarding Channel migrants crossing from France seems to go from bad to worse. Hot on the heels of revelations that a refugee from Afghanistan who was granted asylum here turned out to be a Russian spy, further damaging details have emerged.\nHome Secretary Accused of Deception\nNigel Farage has accused Home Secretary Rishi Sunak of willfully deceiving the nation over his policy to deport illegal migrants to Rwanda. Farage exclusively revealed on his GB News show that despite Sunak’s tough rhetoric, migrants can still delay removal for 180 days. The backlog waiting to enter the system could reach 150,000 by 2026.\nWhen announcing the Rwanda policy in March 2022, Sunak stood behind a podium with the slogan “Stop the Boats” and claimed anyone crossing the Channel illegally would not be able to claim asylum and would face rapid deportation. However, leaked Home Office documents show this is untrue. Migrants can lodge appeals lasting up to 180 days, and detention facilities only have capacity for 1,000 people, mostly serious foreign criminals already in the system.\nFarage declares: “Literally at the moment he was making his promises, he was being told none of this is going to work.” He adds, “You can do lots of things with the British public but you can’t lie to them,” arguing Sunak will not be forgiven come the next election.\nOnly 500 Set for Rwanda This Year\nA Home Office spokesperson disputes the leaked papers, stating both governments always made clear the Rwanda scheme would build capacity over time. But Farage highlights the documents show only 500 illegal arrivals were ever going to be deported to Rwanda this year.\nAt PMQs this week, Sunak still referenced the Rwanda policy. Farage is adamant: “Not a single plane will go to Rwanda between now and the next general election.”\nIs Immigration Straining Public Services?\nScenes of chaos at an NHS dentist in Bristol have highlighted strains on services. Tory MPs argue migration to Britain has exacerbated such problems. Questioned about difficulties accessing dental care, a representative of the dental profession denied population growth fuelled by immigration was a factor.\nFarage is scathing, stating senior figures in positions of authority are in “total denial” about the impacts of uncontrolled immigration. He believes population growth since Blair’s premiership is damaging quality of life when it comes to healthcare, school places and housing availability. Until this issue is acknowledged, public services will continue to deteriorate.\nTime to Talk About Immigration Impacts\nIn conclusion, it seems the government has been less than transparent about the likely effectiveness of its Rwanda scheme. Public services like healthcare and housing are clearly under strain from rapid population growth not matched by infrastructure investment. As Farage notes, denying immigration is a major contributor does not help find solutions. There needs to be an open debate on how to alleviate pressures caused by immigration, while still welcoming those genuinely seeking asylum. Voters do not take kindly to being misled. Sunak would be wise to level with the public about the complexities involved.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-facts-behind-the-french-farmers-rebellion/content_39.html": "The facts behind the French farmers rebellion\nFarmers’ Rebellion: Unraveling the Fury Against EU Policies\nIntroduction\nIn recent times, the European agricultural landscape has witnessed a surge in protests as farmers express their anger towards EU policies and the green agenda. The catalyst for this discontent was a fiery but mostly peaceful protest that unfolded at the doorstep of the EU. This blog post delves into the reasons behind the farmers’ anger and the impact it’s having on European cities.\nThe Protest Unfolds\nAt the heart of the demonstration were over a thousand tractors, strategically blocking key routes in Belgium and France. Protesters, armed with banners proclaiming “No Farmers, No Food,” tore down a statue believed to be an EU founder. As a result, supermarket shelves in Belgium and France were left nearly empty, prompting a robust response from law enforcement.\nFrench Fervor\nThe French, renowned for their fiery yet mostly peaceful protests, showcased their determination in this demonstration. Their tactics included encircling the capital with tractors to prevent foreign imports from reaching supermarkets. French police, in substantial numbers, were deployed to protect key locations, leading to the arrest of nearly a hundred farmers converging on a food distribution hub in Paris.\nGerman Farmers Enter the Fray\nNot to be outdone, German farmers adopted a more forceful approach, smashing through police cordons. But what exactly is fueling this widespread anger among European farmers?\nThe Core of the Anger\nThe root cause of this farmers’ rebellion lies in a multifaceted attack on their livelihoods by the EU. The measures include banning fertilizers, imposing emissions limits for climate change reasons, soaring energy prices, exorbitant tax hikes, and bureaucratic mandates forcing farmers to leave fields fallow. Additionally, an influx of cheap Ukrainian agricultural products, facilitated by the removal of quotas and tariffs, has inundated the European market.\nUkrainian Influence and Domestic Struggles\nUkraine’s dominance in wheat production has further crippled European farmers, as domestic producers find it challenging to compete under EU regulations. The farmers, in their own words, express the intensity of their frustration, highlighting the unfair competition and struggles imposed by EU policies.\nEU Leaders’ Response\nWhile farmers took to the streets, EU leaders seemed detached from their concerns. Simultaneously, a meeting resulted in the approval of an additional 50 billion euros in aid to Ukraine, exacerbating the farmers’ sense of neglect. French President Macron’s suggestion of granting the EU more power added insult to injury.\nThe Agenda Unveiled\nThe overarching agenda appears to be making farming unaffordable, bankrupting the industry, and displacing farmers from their lands. The consequences mirror a dystopian future reminiscent of China, where small farms succumb to corporate mega-farms, disrupting communities and contributing to a Net Zero climate change technocracy.\nBacklash and Hope for Change\nDespite the challenges, a continent-wide backlash against the technocrats is brewing, signaling potential change ahead of European parliamentary elections. The farmers, standing at the forefront of this resistance, are determined to protect their livelihoods and communities.\nConclusion\nAs Europe grapples with these unprecedented protests, the farmers’ rebellion remains a powerful reminder of the consequences of misguided policies. The clash between the agricultural sector and the EU illuminates the need for a balanced and sustainable approach to ensure the well-being of both farmers and the environment.\nSummary\n– **Widespread Discontent:** The farmers’ rebellion against EU policies reflects a widespread discontent within the agricultural community.\n– **Multifaceted Attack:** EU measures, including fertilizer bans, emissions limits, and bureaucratic mandates, collectively contribute to the farmers’ struggles.\n– **Unfair Competition:** Influx of cheap Ukrainian agricultural products, coupled with removal of quotas and tariffs, has left European farmers unable to compete on a level playing field.\n– **Neglect from EU Leaders:** EU leaders’ detachment from farmers’ concerns, coupled with an allocation of additional aid to Ukraine, exacerbates the farmers’ sense of neglect.\n– **Dystopian Future:** The overarching agenda seems to be making farming unaffordable, bankrupting the industry, and displacing farmers from their lands, reminiscent of China’s trajectory.\n– **Continental Backlash:** Ahead of European parliamentary elections, a continent-wide backlash against technocrats is gaining momentum, with farmers at the forefront of this resistance.\n– **Hope for Change:** The farmers’ rebellion serves as a potent reminder of the consequences of misguided policies, sparking hope for change and a reevaluation of EU agricultural strategies.\nIn conclusion, the clash between European farmers and the EU underscores the urgent need for a balanced and sustainable approach to safeguard the well-being of both farmers and the environment.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-enduring-debate-over-malthusianism/content_949.html": "The Enduring Debate over Malthusianism\nMalthusianism refers to the prediction, made famous in 1798 by the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, that human population growth will inevitably outpace our ability to expand food production and resources. This mismatch, he warned, creates a constant cycle of abundance leading to crisis that keeps humanity oscillating around subsistence levels of living standards. While others had noted this tendency before, Malthus was the first to systematically study its mechanisms and warn of its bleak implications for humanity’s future prospects.\nCore Tenets of Malthusian Theory\nIn his renowned essay, “An Essay on the Principle of Population,” Malthus made several interrelated arguments that sparked an enduring debate:\n– Firstly, he noted that human population has the inherent capacity for rapid, exponential growth while our ability to expand food and other resources can only ever increase linearly, at best.\n– Secondly, this divergence creates a constant cycle whereby periods of prosperity lead to demographic expansion, but this then reduces living standards back down to subsistence, checked by crises like famine, war and disease.\n– Thirdly, he traced poverty not mainly to exploitation, inadequate morals or failures of government policy, as others argued, but ultimately to this human tendency to reproduce faster than improvements in our productive capacities.\n– Finally, he argued that this cycle offers humanity an unappealing choice between either accepting perpetual “misery” from these preventive checks or adopting moral “restraint” – which he called “preventive checks” – to voluntarily curb fertility, such as celibacy.\nCriticism of Malthusian Ideas\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, these pessimistic predictions sparked outrage across the ideological spectrum:\n– Early socialists contested his tracing of poverty to over-breeding rather than exploitation of labour or deficiencies of character.\n– Advocates of laissez-faire economics argued market forces and technology could overcome any limits, seeing his ideas as an attack on profits and individual liberties.\n– Christian moralists were appalled by his rejection of charity for the poor and lack of faith in human progress.\n– Early feminists noted his failure to consider female education and empowerment over fertility as solutions.\n– Even in famine-struck Ireland, critics said more equitable land ownership and better governance, not population control, were needed.\nNonetheless, his term “Malthusian trap” stuck as shorthand for the idea of human prosperity periodically collapsing back to subsistence levels under demographic pressures. When over-population actually triggers such die-offs from starvation, disease or violence, it became known as a “Malthusian catastrophe”.\nThe Role of Technology in Avoiding Crisis\nThe most valid criticism made against Malthus was his failure to adequately consider the role technological change could play in overcoming the constraints he defined. As living standards decline under demographic pressure, the incentive grows for societies to invest in productivity-enhancing innovations to escape this trap. Of course, Malthus wrote prior to the phenomenal advances of the Industrial Revolution that soon followed – his ideas influenced thinkers like Charles Darwin but he failed to foresee how economic development would relax the grim “iron law” he described.\nLater Revivals of Malthusian Thinking\nHowever, whenever rapid population growth has reappeared since, fears of Malthusian crisis have surfaced as well. Concerns over “race suicide” from declining birth rates led to a revival of his ideas in the early 20th century. The next neo-Malthusian resurgence came after World War 2, driven by decolonisation and medical advances driving soaring population growth across Asia, Africa and Latin America.\nInfluential figures like William Vogt and Fairfield Osborn warned of imminent global catastrophe from overpopulation, a view popularised from the 1960s by Paul Ehrlich’s bestseller “The Population Bomb”. Leading academics and organisations like the Club of Rome made similarly dire forecasts.\nBut once again, the worst predictions proved premature. The Green Revolution boosted food production ahead of population. And the transition towards lower fertility first seen in the West soon spread to developing nations too, with global population growth peaking around 1965 before declining.\nHave We Escaped the Malthusian Trap?\nDoes this mean humanity has permanently escaped the “Malthusian spectre” thanks to technology and the ongoing fertility transition? Perhaps – Julian Simon became famous in the 1980s for his counter-view that human creativity is “the ultimate resource” that makes all limits imaginary. And so far, warnings of imminent catastrophe keep proving wrong.\nBut several factors explain why Malthusian thinking nonetheless endures and remains hotly debated:\n– Firstly, key resources do appear finite, especially crucial ones like oil, gas, coal, uranium, phosphorus, clean water and arable land. Perhaps technology will continue to find substitutes, but this can’t be assumed.\n– Secondly, while technology has postponed crisis so far, innovation itself may be subject to diminishing returns – future advances could become harder not easier, especially in a complex, interconnected global economy.\n– Thirdly, the global demographic transition is happening slower in sub-Saharan Africa where populations are still rising exponentially. And humanitarian attitudes limit willingness for the draconian fertility restraint that Malthus saw as essential.\nSo while an imminent Malthusian catastrophe no longer seems the most likely trajectory, his warnings arguably cannot be fully dismissed. Natural scientists increasingly talk of “planetary boundaries” in terms of habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and climate change. And slowing progress in nutrition and development indicators in parts of Africa suggest pockets of Malthusian trap may still exist. We may still struggle to keep expanding global prosperity faster than our numbers and environmental impacts – time will tell whether Malthus’ ideas return to mainstream credibility as limits start to bite.\nWhy the Debate Still Matters\nWhy does this debate started over 200 years ago still matter? There are several reasons:\nFirstly, it cuts to surprisingly fundamental divides that still shape attitudes on economic, environmental and geopolitical issues today. Are you generally an optimist or pessimist about whether technology and human ingenuity will overcome the constraints of a finite planet? Should we worry more about rising prosperity or rising populations straining global resources?\nSecondly, it influences core policy choices – are investments to boost productivity more urgent than curbing population growth? Or is slowing population growth in poor countries a prerequisite to their development?\nThirdly, how experts and the public view these trade-offs shapes social attitudes on issues like immigration and fertility in subtle ways. Concerns over runaway population growth legitimised abusive practices from forced sterilisation to immigration restrictions targeting certain ethnicities.\nLastly, the environmental strain from rising populations and consumption underpins issues like climate change, biodiversity collapse and strained water resources. While technology and slowing population growth make an imminent and catastrophic Malthusian crisis improbable now, whether slower-burn crises ultimately prove Malthus right remains uncertain. His warnings of biophysical limits on endless expansion may yet reclaim relevance this century as environmental pressures mount – for now, the jury is still out.\nOver 200 years since he put quill to paper, the Reverend Malthus still has much to teach us about the perpetual tension between human aspirations and environmental limits. Calamity may now seem avoidable, but keeping it so perpetually will require proving the under-estimated Malthus wrong across generations to come.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_vauxhall-makers-boss-warns-of-disaster-over-uks-net-zero-crackdown/content_569.html": "Vauxhall Maker’s Boss Warns of ‘Disaster’ Over UK’s Net Zero Crackdown\nThreat to Pull Out of British Market\nThe chief executive of Stellantis, the company that manufactures Vauxhall vehicles, has issued a stern warning that the UK government’s net zero crackdown on combustion engines could force the automaker to withdraw from the British market altogether. Carlos Tavares, the outspoken CEO, has lambasted the law aimed at limiting petrol car sales as a “disaster for the UK” that would compel manufacturers to sell vehicles at a loss.\nIf ministers fail to make urgent modifications to the rules, Tavares suggested that Stellantis might be compelled to drastically reduce the number of cars it sells in Britain – or even cease selling them here entirely. A source close to the company indicated that restricting sales in the UK was the more likely option.\nProfitability Concerns and ‘Reality Crash’ for Electric Cars\nWhen queried about the possibility of Vauxhall and Citroën halting model sales in the UK, Tavares was unequivocal: “I’m not going to sell cars at a loss.” He blamed the lacklustre demand for electric cars, which he claims are “crashing in the world of reality” due to high prices, inadequate charging infrastructure, and consumer range anxiety.\nAccording to Tavares, the current “natural” market share of electric cars is merely half of what car companies are mandated to sell under regulations introduced this year. He cautioned that the government’s zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate would force carmakers to slash prices to unprofitable levels in order to meet the targets and avoid punitive fines.\nBiggest Intervention from a Major Carmaker\nTavares’ remarks represent the most significant intervention to date from a major carmaker, as others have also recently cautioned that legislation in the UK and Europe is advancing more rapidly than consumer demand. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), sales of battery electric models accounted for approximately 15.5% of total car registrations in the first three months of 2024, roughly the same proportion as a year ago.\nHowever, under the ZEV mandate, which the UK implemented in January, at least 22% of cars sold by manufacturers must be electric. This target gradually increases to 80% by 2030, with a total ban on sales of new petrol cars scheduled to take effect from 2035.\n‘A Disaster for the UK’\nTavares did not mince words, describing the rules as “a disaster for the UK.” He claimed to have urged Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary, to make changes during a meeting on Wednesday. In a briefing with journalists on Thursday, he elaborated: “It’s very simple. The ZEV mandate is [forcing] carmakers to have a growing EV sales mix every year.\n“The problem is the natural demand of the market today in the UK on EVs is half of the mandate. If your mandate is imposing on you a level of BEV [battery electric vehicle] sales mix that is double the natural demand of the market, and if the ZEV mandate puts me in a corner by saying, ‘if you don’t meet this, I’m going to kill you with fines’, the consequence is that everybody will start pushing the BEV, which then totally destroys profitability.\n“You would not expect Stellantis to support a red ink business.”\nProposed Solutions and Easing Pressure\nTo alleviate the strain on carmakers, Tavares has urged the government to combine their allowance for passenger cars and light vans, while also permitting manufacturers to include cars they produce for export towards their domestic targets.\nHe also warned that compelling carmakers to oversell EVs would leave European carmakers more vulnerable to the threat from low-cost Chinese electric car models. However, he stated that Stellantis opposed the introduction of punitive tariffs on Chinese manufacturers, adding that the company was already “fighting everywhere” for market share and that “protectionism” would ultimately lead to higher prices that hurt consumers.\nAffordability and Competitiveness\nTavares emphasized the importance of making EVs more affordable for the middle class, stating: “If you only sell EVs to the wealthy, it doesn’t fix global warming.” He dismissed the notion of reintroducing EV grants that were scrapped in 2022, saying: “I am not asking for incentives. I could. But that [means] more taxes for UK citizens – I don’t think we need more taxes.”\nInstead, he proposed an offensive approach: “Why don’t we try to be offensive instead of being defensive against the Chinese, who obviously are demonstrating some kind of additional competitiveness? Why don’t we try ourselves to accelerate, and to use the brains of our people, to move faster in the affordability, in the technology, the manufacturing?”\nDiscounting and Government’s Stance\nThis comes after The Telegraph reported that three-quarters of new EVs listed on Auto Trader were being advertised at a discount, indicating that manufacturers and dealers are already being forced to slash prices.\nThe government has previously insisted that the ZEV mandate will safeguard British industry jobs and is “specifically designed to support existing manufacturers by providing flexibilities so they can comply with targets over time.”\nThe Department for Transport was contacted for comment but did not provide a statement at the time of writing.\nAnnual ZEV Mandate targets to 2030\n| Year | Proportion of car sales to be zero-emissions | Proportion of van sales to be zero-emissions |\n| 2024 | 22% | 10% |\n| 2025 | 28% | 16% |\n| 2026 | 33% | 24% |\n| 2027 | 38% | 34% |\n| 2028 | 52% | 46% |\n| 2029 | 66% | 58% |\n| 2030 | 80% | 70% |\nThe obsessive move to EVs is already a catastrophe, with owners desperate to dump their EVs and move back to Internal Combustion Engines, sales a plummeting, resale values are sinking and the Chinese are poised to flood Europe with their cut price cars which will not only destroy our car manufacturing, but the threat to our security is sinister, for example;\n“How many cars would it take to gridlock London?”\nThe statement by Vauxhall is not only worrying, but it is also an indication of what is yet to come, should these ridiculous targets continue to be enforced. I have no doubt that the tide will turn, as the push for EVs is unsustainable, but in the meantime, the problem is, that every day, more and more ICEs are being scrapped and we may wake up one day in the near future and find that the EV experiment has collapsed and we will be left short of alternatives with our car production industry in crisis.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_political-upheaval-as-reform-uk-faces-internal-challenges-amid-rising-poll-numbers/content_977.html": "Political Upheaval as Reform UK Faces Internal Challenges Amid Rising Poll Numbers\nRecent political polling from Find Out Now has revealed a significant shift in the UK’s political landscape, with Labour dropping to 25 points, Reform UK drawing level at 25 points, and the Conservatives falling to 20 points. Both the Green Party and Liberal Democrats trail at 11 points each, marking a notable realignment in voter intentions.\nThe shifting political dynamics were highlighted at Reform UK’s South East conference, where former Conservative Borough Councillor Harrison Orman-Varti announced his dramatic defection. The move, which was only disclosed to Conservative Party officials hours before the announcement, was met with mixed reactions, including warnings about potential career implications for the defector.\nThe conference, held in Sandown, Elmbridge, demonstrated Reform UK’s growing momentum, with tickets selling out within 48 hours. While some Conservative councillors expressed regret at Orman-Varti’s departure, they acknowledged the underlying reasons for his decision, though many long-serving members indicated their reluctance to follow suit due to party loyalty spanning decades.\nOrman-Varti cited recent political developments, particularly the handling of grooming gangs legislation, as a crucial factor in his decision. He pointed to Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch’s recent parliamentary actions, suggesting that while procedurally correct, they highlighted the party’s previous inaction when in power. This contradiction, he argued, would continue to undermine Conservative credibility through to the next general election.\nAddressing accusations of political opportunism, Orman-Varti, who now leads Reform UK in his council by default, defended his decision as the more challenging path. He emphasised the significant groundwork required to establish Reform UK’s presence in his constituency, noting that the first-past-the-post electoral system means national polling success doesn’t necessarily translate to local victories.\nHowever, Reform UK faces its own internal challenges, with twelve councillors announcing their resignation in protest against Nigel Farage’s leadership. The departing councillors branded the party leader as “disloyal and autocratic,” expressing concerns about the party’s management and constitutional structure. They specifically cited issues with internal democracy and alleged that Farage had failed to fulfil his promise to democratise the party, which remains structured as a company with him holding a controlling stake.\nThe party’s chairman, Ben Habib, responded to these allegations, suggesting there were underlying issues regarding candidate quality and some member suspensions, implying the situation was more complex than initially reported. Some observers have suggested this might be an attempt by media outlets to undermine Reform UK’s growing momentum.\nAdding to the party’s challenges, a public disagreement emerged between Elon Musk and Nigel Farage, despite their previous apparent alliance showcased at Mar-a-Lago. Musk’s unexpected criticism of Farage’s leadership role in Reform UK was met with a diplomatic response from Farage, who maintained they remained friends despite their disagreement.\nPolitical analysts suggest that Farage’s biggest challenge lies in managing his personal brand, particularly in traditional Conservative and Liberal Democrat strongholds. His strategy appears to involve carefully positioning himself to maintain broad appeal while distancing the party from more controversial political figures who might alienate voters in key target areas, particularly in the home counties.\nThe situation highlights the complex dynamics of British politics as traditional party loyalties continue to shift, with Reform UK’s rising popularity presenting both opportunities and challenges for the established political order. As the party continues to attract high-profile defectors while managing internal dissent, its ability to maintain momentum while building local infrastructure will be crucial to its long-term success.\nSummary Conclusion\nThe political developments surrounding Reform UK and the broader UK political landscape reveal several significant trends and challenges:\n* Recent polling shows a dramatic shift in voter intentions, with Reform UK rising to equal Labour at 25%, while the Conservatives have fallen to 20%, marking a potential realignment of traditional political allegiances.\n* The defection of Conservative councillor Harrison Orman-Varti highlights growing dissatisfaction within local Conservative ranks, particularly regarding the party’s handling of key issues like grooming gangs legislation.\n* Reform UK faces internal challenges despite its rising popularity:\n– Twelve councillors have resigned over concerns about party leadership\n– Questions about internal democracy and party structure remain unresolved\n– The relationship between party leader Nigel Farage and high-profile supporters like Elon Musk has shown signs of strain\n* The party’s future success appears to depend on several critical factors:\n– Balancing national popularity with local electoral success under the first-past-the-post system\n– Managing Farage’s personal brand in traditional Conservative and Liberal Democrat areas\n– Building effective local party infrastructure while maintaining national momentum\n– Navigating internal party democracy issues while retaining central control\n* The situation reflects broader changes in British politics, where traditional party loyalties are weakening and new political forces are emerging to challenge the established order.\nThese developments suggest a potentially significant realignment in British politics, though the long-term sustainability of Reform UK’s current position remains to be tested through actual electoral performance.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-roman-kourion/content_72.html": "Roman Kourion (c. 50 BC – AD 500)\nCyprus was annexed by Rome in 58 BC after complex political and diplomatic wrangling between the Roman Senate and the Ptolemaic kingdom. After a generation of financial and personal mis-administration by Roman officials, followed by the tense civil wars between Pompey, Caesar, Mark Antony, Cleopatra and Augustus, the island settled down to become an essentially peaceful Roman province. While the island had been of great strategic value to its Ptolemaic rulers, its military importance ceased once the limits of the Roman empire were stabilised well to the east in Syria, hence its administration by the Roman Senate rather than by the emperor. Cyprus settled down to become a prosperous and, with a few exceptions, largely quiescent province under the Pax Romana.\nRoman Cyprus is often described as a backwater because of its uneventful political history, but this very factor allowed the island to develop into the type of province the military machine of the Roman empire was designed to encourage and protect: a world of peaceful, prosperous, semi-autonomous communities, whose leading citizens competed with each other for the honour of serving their cities with benefactions and public services.\nLimited historical sources make it difficult to determine how active the community of Kourion was in pursuing the sort of activities typical of their contemporaries in other provinces of the empire. Surviving epigraphic records suggest that it was in fact little different from other communities of the island or many parts of the eastern Roman empire. It should be noted, however, that the relative neglect of the Roman period on Cyprus has resulted in a rather impressionistic picture of the island, with little detailed attention to the rich archaeological record, despite the abundance of surviving monuments in most of the major sites, including Kourion itself.\nThe large body of inscriptions from this period demonstrate the typical operation of civic life, but also put the town in its wider imperial context. Emperors such as Nero, Trajan or Hadrian, the proconsuls, as well as local officials, priests and worthies, dedicated numerous offerings in the sanctuaries, especially the shrine of Apollo Hylates (‘of the woodland’) which enjoyed something of an international reputation in Roman times. The inscriptions also record the cosmopolitan nature of the population, with officials and traders drawn from other parts of the empire. These included Jewish elements, in the form of the cult of Hypsistos (‘Almighty’), which combined Graeco-Roman and Judaic elements. This influence has also been detected at the nearby town of Amathus, where curses written on lead and selenite (gypsum) tablets may reflect Jewish magical traditions, though of a kind familiar throughout the empire.\nExcavations by the Department of Antiquities on the acropolis have also revealed much evidence of this prosperity. The theatre was extended several times, reaching its greatest extent under Trajan (AD 98–117) when it could have accommodated around 3,000–4,000 people. Remains of the agora, at least one side of which was surrounded by a monumental stoa, date from the same time in the second century AD. An impressive Nymphaeum, which also functioned as the major source of water for the centre of the city, is one of the largest of its type known in the eastern Mediterranean. Several adjacent buildings, such as the House of the Gladiators and the House of the Achilles Mosaic, are renowned for their finely executed mosaic decoration. Finally, a large stadium of Antonine date at the locality still called At Meydan (‘racecourse’) outside the city completes the picture of a typical city of the eastern Roman empire.\nThe sanctuary of Apollo Hylates also witnessed major changes during Roman times and reached its most monumental and complex state. Both of the major deposits of votive offerings from the CA to Hellenistic phases of the site were created in the middle of the 1st century AD, suggesting the sacred space was being reorganised on a significant scale at this time. The first phase of the present temple of Apollo was erected during the reign of Augustus (27 BC–AD 14), while the structure was completed with its familiar portico of columns early in the reign of Trajan in AD 101. Trajan also paid for a large structure known as the South Building, probably used as a dormitory or storerooms. Buildings typical of sanctuaries throughout the empire, including a large bathhouse and a palaestra (sports centre), were also added to what was by now one of the main sanctuaries of the island and indeed of the eastern Mediterranean.\nReconstruction of the sanctuary of Apollo Hylates in the Roman period. The Temple of Apollo is at the top of the illustration, next to the much older Cypro-Archaic temenos. The main sacred area was surrounded by buildings serving the needs of pilgrims and the officials of the shrine. (Image kindly provided by Dr David Soren).\nA single item from the sanctuary is known to have entered the British Museum collection, this fine gold necklace inlaid with garnets. It was purchased from Percy Christian in 1897, and is said to have come from here. If this provenance is correct, then it is possible that this was a personal item dedicated by a pilgrim in Roman times.\nThe complex was badly damaged in an earthquake in the middle of the 4th century AD, after which there is very little evidence for cult activity, though there are signs of decline even before this disaster. The rise of Christianity during this time would have discouraged the extensive reconstruction of the sanctuary, especially after the imperial edict of AD 395 closing the pagan temples. The town itself, perhaps weakened by economic decline and the impact of earlier seismic activity, was also devastated by earthquakes in the 4th century AD. Dramatic evidence for this has been revealed in the ruins of houses on the acropolis. Despite this setback, the town was eventually rebuilt, perhaps after a period of abandonment, but apparently thrived into Late Antiquity when the city was the seat of the local bishop, probably based in the fine Christian basilica on the acropolis. The location of the so-called extra-mural basilica close to the site of the Classical shrine where Demeter and Kore were once honoured may have been coincidental, but could reflect an accommodation of older cult places by the new religion.\nRoman period, late 4th century AD\nThe town was finally abandoned some time in the 7th century, when a combination of economic decline and the threat from Arab raiders made the coastal areas less attractive for settlement. The population moved inland to the site of the modern village of Episkopi, whose name reflects the fact that the new settlement remained the centre of ecclesiastical administration. The humble jug from the Hake-Kitchener excavations in 1882 illustrated here must have been among the items in use in this final phase of the town, which had been occupied for well over a thousand years.\nBurial customs\nFew tombs of Roman date from the Kourion area have been published in detail. Both of the main types, chamber tombs with long entrance passages and simpler pit graves from the earth or bedrock, continued earlier Hellenistic types represented elsewhere on Cyprus at Amathus and Paphos (where numerous burials of this period have been discovered in recent years) but also from older excavations at Kontoura Trachonia, Tsambres and Apehendrika in the Karpas peninsula.[105] There is also much evidence to suggest that many older Hellenistic funeral vaults were commonly reused, often by the addition of new niches or side-chambers (loculi) though this is not always clear from the descriptions of the British Museum-excavated tombs.\nAs before, in chamber tombs the deceased were laid out on the floor of the chamber or loculus, sometimes on benches with headrests or within sarcophagi (stone coffins). Coffins were also made of clay or wood and often do not survive, especially from older excavations. Niches with arched roofs (called arcosolia) and in-built sarcophagi, which were cut into the walls of tomb chambers, became very common in the Roman period and especially around the Kourion area. As the accompanying pictures of the Amathus Gate and Akrotiri cemeteries show, these are sometimes the only parts of the tomb that have survived millennia of man-made and natural destruction. In addition, many tombs were provided with cylindrical tombstones (known as cippi), usually inscribed with just the name of the deceased and a simple farewell.\nTomb 113 of the British Museum excavations consisted of a large rectangular chamber 5.2 x 1.5m and 1.13m wide approached by a stepped passageway. Two large recesses between 2.1m and 2.4m long opened from the back wall, while smaller niches led off the side of the chamber. Both of these side-chambers contained a sarcophagus, though one also had a lead urn full of cremated bone. The finds recorded by Walters date the tomb to the 1st or 2nd century AD: many glass bottles and other vessels, decorated lamps, bronze coins, several spindle whorls, and a bronze mirror and spatula. An inscription cut above one of the stone coffins in the right-hand recess is an epitaph in Greek to Metrodoros son of Metonos.\nAlthough rather neglected by earlier excavators and many modern scholars, simpler tombs for small numbers of burials, with little or no architectural elaboration, were also very common in Roman times, as they had been for centuries before. They are commonly called mneimata (the plural of mnema) in the scholarly literature, and the term is often used in Walters’ notebook of his excavations at Kourion in 1895.\nThese mneimata are essentially rectangular pits cut in the earth or rock for a small number of interments, similar in many respects to modern Western graves. Earth graves were sometimes lined or covered with stone slabs or tiles, while rock-excavated examples often show refinements such as carefully cut sides or ledges for a covering slab. Despite their simpler form, some of these graves show signs of wealth and are sometimes placed in the same cemetery plots as chamber tombs. Both adults (men and women) and children were interred in surface graves. From this it follows that they were not necessarily the burial places of the poor, or predominantly late in date, as was once commonly argued.\nAt the same time, changes in burial practices are visible at Kourion over time. The cremation burial in Tomb 113 just mentioned, though never very common, is one sign of a shift away from exclusive use of inhumation. The older Hellenistic and early Roman chamber tombs below the Amathus Gate of the city appear to have been abandoned, after which the area was extensively quarried. From the 4th century AD, single burials were commonly placed in stone cists covered with large slabs in the same area as the older chambers. These graves were connected to the surface by small pipes to allow libations to be offered to the dead after the sealing of the tomb. This practice, as well as the offering of grave goods, apparently continued for a time after the advent of Christianity.",

The houseboats bobbing gently, dog walkers strolling along the wide riverside pavements beneath the dappled shade of the London planes. The 20mph speed limit encourages even taxis to maintain a relaxed pace.\nIf only it weren’t for the two-wheeled boy racers hurtling around the bend at the yacht club, transforming this stretch into one of the capital’s most hotly contested – and illegal – time trials.\nA staggering 52mph is the record logged on Strava for a 0.63km segment of this 20mph zone hugging the Thames. The “King of the Mountain” for the “Tite St to Chelsea Bridge” segment completed it in just 27 seconds one Tuesday morning last July. Newly crowned, he no doubt sped on, flushed with victory, towards Millbank and over Vauxhall Bridge. One can only imagine the sense of accomplishment as he checked his phone to find his mates could now admire his morning exploits.\nTo date, over 122,000 people have attempted this particular covert race route, one of hundreds that have emerged across London and other UK cities, digitally mapped as invisible courses for cyclists chasing kudos and bragging rights.\nThere are no start and finish gantries, no race marshals – just a cyclist’s phone zipped into a pocket or mounted on their handlebars, measuring every metric as they charge along in pursuit of a personal best or an opportunity to eclipse a rival’s time.\nFor these underground athletes, GPS fitness apps have become an obsession, allowing them to map routes or choose from a growing library of user-generated segments in their quest to outshine their peers. In 2023, over 120 million people worldwide used Strava, the most popular of these apps – up from 95 million the previous year and just 20 million in 2016. For many, they are simply a useful fitness tool. But for others, critics warn, they are turning Britain’s roads into death traps.\nThe apps came under fire this week from the Royal Parks, who wrote to Strava and competitors demanding the outer circle of Regent’s Park be removed from their platforms. In June 2022, 81-year-old Hilda Griffiths was struck by a cyclist in the park and later died from her injuries. Brian Fitzgerald, a director at Credit Suisse, was involved in the collision. He was part of a “fast group” of cyclists reaching up to 29mph in a 20mph zone when Mrs Griffiths was hit. Fitzgerald had been using a Garmin device to time laps.\nAn inquest heard that while police concluded Fitzgerald could not be prosecuted as speed limits don’t legally apply to pedal cyclists, they said the “culture of cycling” in the park, with people “racing” to log faster times, had contributed to the tragedy. Mrs Griffiths’ son, Gerard, said over 35 cycling clubs use the green space as an informal “velodrome”.\nJust last month, The Telegraph revealed another dog walker was seriously injured by a cyclist at the same Regent’s Park spot. Paolo Dos Santos is still waiting to hear if the Metropolitan Police will charge the rider who allegedly strayed onto the wrong side of the road while “overtaking a car”.\nA Strava spokesperson offered condolences to Mrs Griffiths’ family, saying: “The behaviours related to this incident violate Strava’s community standards.” They noted it is possible to flag hazardous cycling routes within the app, disabling leaderboards and achievement badges. “Anyone can report a segment that they deem hazardous…Any Strava user will receive a warning about the hazards on that route.”\nHowever, while apps like Strava leave it largely to users to identify risks, concern is growing over the impact of this new breed of competitive amateur cycling on Britain’s streets.\nOfficial UK statistics show 462 people were injured by cyclists in 2022, up from 437 the previous year when one person died, and 308 in 2020 with four fatalities. This week, the government agreed to create new offences of causing death or serious injury through dangerous or careless cycling, closing a loophole that had capped sentences at just two years’ imprisonment under a 19th-century law designed for horse-drawn carriages. Offenders could now face life terms.\nAsk pedestrians about the menace posed by speeding cyclists and the sentiment is unanimous. On Reddit, people despair at new housing developments suddenly gaining Strava “segments” as attracting “cycle enthusiasts” who “race down it with little care about who else is using it”.\n“I have been on the path when an irresponsible cyclist has zoomed past me,” writes one woman walking her dogs on a new shared path. “We all use it for dog walks, kids playing and family cycles, so having bikes whizz by with no warning is so dangerous.”\nStrava’s leaderboards for these hotspot segments often have catchy names like the “Whitehall Tourist Dodge” – a half-mile stretch where over 92,000 cyclists have tried to beat the 42mph record. While some top times are set by professionals on closed roads, most are logged by amateur enthusiasts.\nIn Manchester, one of the most popular is “Gun it to the lights” on Oxford Road, a 0.26-mile section with a 20mph limit but a top speed of 47mph. In Birmingham’s Lee Bank Underpass (30mph limit), no one has topped 46mph since May 2019, while over 40,000 attempts have been made on Calthorpe Road at up to 38mph.\nEven scenic Richmond Park isn’t immune, despite its 10mph trails and 20mph roads. “A cyclist screamed at us ‘I’m doing a time trial!'”, one woman recalls, “acting like we should feel bad for holding him up when he was going way above the limit.”\nAnother describes how “bikes regularly whizz up behind us on shared paths with no warning – you can’t tell which side they’re coming from. It’s so dangerous.”\nAccording to Strava data, the current King of the Mountain for the park’s most popular 0.8-mile segment up Sawyers Hill completed it in 1 minute 36 seconds – over 30mph.\nSome Strava fans argue the dangerous cyclists are a small minority, claiming “The idea there are cyclists all over London obsessed with setting PBs on flat, pedestrian-heavy roads is fanciful.” Though they admit Richmond and Regent’s are “exceptions” due to their popularity with cycling clubs: “large groups cycling anti-socially on roads not designed for packs travelling at very high speed.”\nFor most, they say, publicly logging times simply provides “accountability” during training. But others admit the apps actively “encourage” them to “cycle faster” even on casual rides: “Because you’re still on the clock and want to meet or beat a time.”\nThe problem, critics argue, is that these impromptu time trials are unfolding on urban roads whose primary purpose should be allowing all road users – drivers, sensible cyclists and pedestrians – to travel safely from A to B, not hosting an unofficial daily Tour de France.\nPerhaps apps like Strava could be repurposed to help pedestrians avoid these racetrack segments? Or the lycra-clad masses could take their need for speed to the nearest velodrome, and leave Britain’s streets free for their intended purpose.\nComment\nIt’s only a matter of weeks since Auriol Grey was released from prison, where she has spent over a year, because she waved her arms at a cyclist who was riding on the path and the cyclist wobbled on to the road into the path of a car and died.\nEntitled and aggressive cyclists have become a threat to pedestrians in towns and cities across the UK, yet they seem to get away with murder. In fact, just last week, a cyclist who knocked down an elderly lady at 29mpg in a 20mph zone, walked free because there is not speed limit for cyclists.\nThis is becoming a serious problem and one that is in urgent need of addressing.",

Yes, you couldn’t make this nonsense up!\nIf you have seen the embarrassing video made by Ed Milliband brandishing a Ukulele, the answer IS NOT blowing in the wind.\nIn fact, if we were to be given the true facts, we will see that they actually do not produce much energy at all, they cost billions and they are making certain people very rich at your expense.\nIn reality, the only beneficiaries of these monstrosities that are a blight on the landscape are the manufacturers, the owners, and the landowners who receive a sizable rent for them sitting on their land, a sum which is greater than using the land for what it should be used for, which is growing food for the people.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_starmer-has-destroyed-labour/content_101.html": "Starmer Has Destroyed Labour\nReform’s Runcorn Victory Signals Profound Electoral Discontent\nNever in my personal recollection has a political organisation so thoroughly deserved such an electoral thrashing. By the narrowest margin of merely six votes, the Labour Party has endured a thoroughly mortifying defeat in Runcorn. Prime Minister Keir Starmer failed to make even a single appearance in the constituency throughout the entirety of the campaign; the rationale behind this glaring absence has now become painfully apparent.\nThe customary qualifications must naturally be acknowledged. Numerous comparable by-election triumphs have been secured by the Liberal Democrats, Social Democratic Party, and various minor political entities throughout previous decades. It would be methodologically unsound to extrapolate by-election outcomes across the entirety of the United Kingdom. Additionally, Nigel Farage’s political movement, unburdened by any governmental record requiring defence, operated with a distinct tactical advantage.\nFor the Conservative Party, the electoral results represented an abysmal showing; however, it bears emphasising that this constituency had been captured by Labour with an overwhelming 14,696 majority during the previous year’s general election and ranked as the party’s 49th most secure seat amongst the 411 constituencies it had successfully claimed in 2024. The Prime Minister’s personal approval ratings have experienced a precipitous decline, whilst Labour has remarkably fallen behind Reform in several opinion polls. There exists a growing sentiment that the current political realignment might prove more enduring than previous electoral anomalies.\nThe Government’s extensively promoted agenda for “change” and its lofty promises regarding “growth” now lie thoroughly shattered. Their rhetorical positioning has suggested centrism whilst their governance has demonstrated decidedly left-wing tendencies: substantially increasing taxation burdens whilst directing the resultant revenues towards public sector employees and foreign interests such as Mauritius. The administration has overseen increases in household energy costs despite explicit campaign pledges to reduce them, alienated agricultural communities and small enterprise owners, facilitated rising unemployment figures, and catalysed significant turbulence within bond markets.\nPerhaps most egregiously, the Government has implemented precisely zero effective measures to curtail legal migration, whilst simultaneously presiding over unprecedented levels of small boat crossings across the English Channel. The outsourcing giant Serco is now actively providing financial incentives to property owners to accommodate these migrants, offering five-year rental agreements with guaranteed income underwritten entirely by the British taxpayer. Few informed observers genuinely believe that Home Secretary Yvette Cooper harbours any authentic desire to reduce immigration numbers: recent governmental data reveals that benefit claims submitted by refugee households have exceeded the staggering threshold of £1 billion. Reform UK, by stark contrast, has unambiguously committed to withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights and implementing a policy whereby no undocumented migrants would receive settlement rights within British territory.\nHigh-net-worth individuals are pursuing the economically rational course by relocating abroad. Independent educational establishments are ceasing operations, whilst commercial enterprises are distributing redundancy notices with increasing frequency. Citizens increasingly question the fundamental purpose of academic advancement, professional diligence, and entrepreneurial risk-taking when these commendable endeavours fail to yield improved living standards. Young people, according to expert testimony recently presented to a House of Lords Committee, express reluctance to commence employment for annual compensation packages below £40,000. This phenomenon transcends mere indolence: our excessively complicated welfare and taxation frameworks have created a perverse situation whereby accepting entry-level employment positions frequently represents a financial disadvantage.\nWith mechanical predictability resembling an aircraft on autopilot, a Labour spokesperson has responded to this devastating by-election setback by insisting that the Government simply needs to “move faster” with its existing programme. Reminiscent of the charlatan medical practitioner whose solution to deteriorating patient conditions involves doubling the ineffective treatment dosage, Starmer appears determined to maintain his high-taxation, high-expenditure economic approach with dogmatic inflexibility. When Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced a £5 billion reduction in disability benefit provisions (which will nevertheless still increase by more than £20 billion by 2030), her announcement prompted immediate and vociferous opposition from numerous Labour parliamentarians. These dissenters would evidently prefer Chancellor Rachel Reeves implemented a comprehensive wealth tax instead.\nWhilst Labour persists in adhering to fundamentally flawed economic assumptions – that government expenditure constitutes the primary driver of economic growth, that achieving Net Zero carbon emissions represents the pre-eminent commercial opportunity of the contemporary era, that all individuals arriving via unauthorised Channel crossings represent legitimate asylum seekers, that gross domestic product expansion necessitates mass immigration, and that private enterprise represents a predatory entity requiring regulatory constraint rather than the essential economic engine – Britain’s decline shall inevitably continue unabated. Notwithstanding the Government’s proclivity for uttering meaningless platitudes regarding “fixing foundations” and engaging in tiresome complaints about “14 years of Conservative chaos”, the electorate demonstrates increasing awareness regarding genuine accountability for current circumstances.\nThe British public now faces the disheartening prospect of four additional years under this spectacularly incompetent administration. The Runcorn by-election outcome should serve as a stark warning that Reform UK has established itself as a significant and enduring political force. Nevertheless, the Labour leadership appears determined to intensify its deeply unpopular policy agenda rather than acknowledging legitimate public concerns.\nThe Government’s approach to economic management has proven particularly disastrous. By implementing punitive taxation measures targeting wealth creators and entrepreneurs, Labour has systematically undermined the very foundations of British prosperity. The administration’s ideological hostility towards independent schools has directly contributed to educational institution closures, whilst simultaneously diminishing Britain’s international standing as a destination for academic excellence.\nCompounding these self-inflicted economic wounds, the Government’s immigration policies have created widespread public disillusionment. Despite campaign rhetoric suggesting a more controlled approach, the practical reality has revealed a fundamental unwillingness to implement meaningful border security measures. The continued influx of undocumented migrants via small boats represents not merely a statistical concern but symbolises governmental indifference towards sovereignty and rule of law.\nLabour’s environmental policies have similarly contributed to mounting public frustration. By prioritising ideologically-driven Net Zero targets over practical energy security considerations, the Government has imposed substantial additional costs upon households already struggling with inflationary pressures. The disconnect between metropolitan environmental theorising and provincial economic realities has never appeared more pronounced.\nThe Runcorn by-election result encapsulates growing nationwide sentiment that Labour fundamentally misunderstands ordinary citizens’ priorities. Rather than addressing substantive concerns regarding economic opportunity, national identity, and community cohesion, the Government has pursued an agenda increasingly perceived as serving narrow ideological objectives rather than broader national interests.\nShould current trends continue, Labour risks cementing its unfortunate transformation into Britain’s most despised political organisation. The remarkable rapidity with which public opinion has shifted against Starmer’s administration suggests profound structural weaknesses within Labour’s governing philosophy that extend well beyond routine mid-term unpopularity.\nAs Reform UK continues gaining electoral momentum, established political parties confront an unprecedented realignment of traditional voting patterns. The Runcorn outcome represents not merely an isolated electoral anomaly but potentially heralds a fundamental restructuring of British political allegiances that could reshape governance for generations to come.\nComment\nThere was a time when Labour represented the working class, it was responsible for being he ‘conscience of politics’ whilst the conservatives were always about reducing spending and saving, Labour were about higher taxation and investment into communities, helping the poor, and much more.\nThere are arguments on both sides, but that is not the issue, the ultimate success of any government is accountability, that is why the principle of government and opposition can work so well, unless those in power are all working against the people whom they represent.\nThe principle of democracy is debate, questions, answers and transparency, yet within weeks of assuming power, this man has destroyed everything that the Labour party stood for, he had the arrogance to stand there and call anyone who disagrees with his disloyal WEF policies ‘Far Right’ He abused the judiciary and guided it to bully people who said anything he wanted to keep quiet into pleading guilty of inciting hatred and had them thrown into prison, whilst his favourite demographic walk free from violent and sexual offences.\nThe local elections were judgement day for this sinister administration, which has the support of the mainstream media, who are more than willing to repeat the false narratives and the misinformation of one of the most toxic leaders in British history.\nThe people have now spoken and this servant of Lucifer needs to go, POST HASTE!",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_eu-vote-shifts-bloc-further-right-than-ever-before/content_1013.html": "EU Vote Shifts Bloc Further Right Than Ever Before\nThe European elections have delivered a political earthquake across the continent, with parties gaining ground that share a common antipathy towards Brussels overreach, immigration, and the EU’s net zero emissions target.\nEmmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France after suffering humiliation at the hands of Marine Le Pen rightly grabbed headlines. However, in Brussels, as the votes were tallied, it began to look like business as usual.\nOlaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, won’t have thanked Macron for stealing the limelight, fresh from leading his centre-left SPD to its worst ever European election result. His unpopular and bickering coalition government is now under immense pressure after being beaten by the centre-right CDU and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nThe victors will undoubtedly ask why Scholz won’t follow Macron’s lead and call an election himself. Europe has swung to the right, just as Britain looks poised to elect a left-wing government.\nLe Pen’s victory was mirrored in significant gains for Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Herbert Kickl’s Freedom Party of Austria, and Alice Weidel’s Alternative for Germany. Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party secured a decisive victory, garnering 28.82 per cent of the vote on Monday with 97 per cent of all votes counted – surpassing the 26 per cent she secured in the September 2022 national elections.\nThese parties all share a common disdain for Brussels overreach, immigration, and the EU’s net zero target. However, they remain divided between pro-Ukraine and pro-Putin factions, which will sap their influence over EU law as it passes through the parliament.\nMeanwhile, traditional centre-right parties emerged victorious in Germany and Spain. The establishment European People’s Party (EPP), an alliance of European conservatives, will once again be the largest single group in the new parliament.\nThis bodes well for EPP member Ursula von der Leyen, who hopes to use the election results to secure a second five-year term as European Commission President.\nThe centre-left Socialists and Democrats, Liberals, Greens, and EPP have long operated in an informal coalition to push through EU law and increase European integration. The socialists, once again the second-largest group, have already signalled their support for Mrs von der Leyen’s appointment.\nDespite the gains for the eurosceptic right, pro-EU parties have maintained their majority. The status quo has held in Brussels, with EU politics proving more resilient to domestic politics in its member states.\nNevertheless, the EU is not impervious to the concerns of its voters. The 2015 migrant crisis has cast a long shadow, and EU attempts to reform asylum policy have failed to dispel it.\nIn Germany, before the elections, a failed asylum seeker attacked an anti-Islam demonstration, resulting in the death of a police officer. This incident may partly explain support for the fiercely anti-immigrant AfD, despite the party being beset by a slew of scandals.\nThe fraying patience with the EU’s net zero goal has been equally influential. In the 2019 elections, the Greens posted their best-ever results, buoyed by the mass climate protests led by Greta Thunberg.\nHowever, the war in Ukraine triggered a cost-of-living crisis, leading to a backlash against EU net zero rules, seen as too expensive and burdensome. Farmers’ protests against these rules have managed to garner support in urban areas across countries like the Netherlands.\nMrs von der Leyen’s flagship net zero policy now faces a significant threat. Her EPP turned against the policy in the face of the farmers’ protests that paralysed Europe. It successfully moved to water down green legislation, removed strict protections for wolves, and railed against a planned ban on petrol engines in cars.\nMrs von der Leyen herself shelved plans to cut pesticide use and agricultural emissions as the tractors rolled through Brussels.\nThe EPP, Liberals, and Socialists can maintain their majority without the Greens’ support. The EPP has also been courting Ms Meloni and could vote with her soft eurosceptic group, potentially dispensing with the Liberals if necessary.\nIn the 2019 European elections, the hard-right consolidated the gains they made in 2014. Since then, the mainstream has adopted their immigration policies, such as Rwanda-style offshore processing of asylum seekers.\nNow, Europe’s greens will fear that the backlash against net zero, fuelled by the cost-of-living crisis caused by the Ukraine war, will become accepted in the same way.\nLe Pen and her hard-right allies may not hold the balance of power in Europe, but their success has already influenced traditional conservatives and is dragging the centre of EU politics further to the right than it has ever been.\nThe implications of this rightward shift are far-reaching. Issues like immigration and climate change policy, once the domain of fringe parties, have now taken centre stage. The mainstream parties, in a bid to stem the flow of voters to the far-right, have been forced to adopt more hardline stances on these issues.\nThis shift raises concerns about the protection of human rights, particularly for immigrants and asylum seekers. The adoption of policies like offshore processing of asylum claims, reminiscent of Australia’s controversial policies, sets a worrying precedent for the treatment of vulnerable groups.\nFurthermore, the backpedalling on climate change commitments and the watering down of environmental protections could have severe long-term consequences for the planet. The EU, once a leader in the fight against climate change, now risks becoming a laggard, bowing to short-term economic pressures at the expense of long-term sustainability.\nThe rise of far-right and eurosceptic parties also poses a threat to the unity and cohesion of the European Union itself. While they may not hold the balance of power currently, their growing influence could embolden calls for greater national sovereignty and a weakening of EU institutions.\nIt remains to be seen how these dynamics will play out in the new European Parliament and Commission. However, one thing is clear: the EU is undergoing a seismic shift, with the political centre of gravity moving further to the right than ever before. How the mainstream parties navigate this new landscape will have far-reaching implications for the future of the bloc and its policies on issues ranging from immigration to climate change.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-highway-code-8-changes-you-need-to-know/content_663.html": "Rules for all types of road users have been updated in The Highway Code to improve the safety of people walking, cycling and riding horses.\n1. Hierarchy of road users\nThe introduction section of The Highway Code has been updated to include 3 new rules about the new ‘hierarchy of road users’.\nThe hierarchy places those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the hierarchy. It does not remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly.\nIt’s important that all road users:\n- are aware of The Highway Code\n- are considerate to other road users\n- understand their responsibility for the safety of others\nThe 3 new rules are numbered H1, H2, and H3.\n2. People crossing the road at junctions\nThe updated code clarifies that:\n- when people are crossing or waiting to cross at a junction, other traffic should give way\n- if people have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, the people crossing have priority and the traffic should give way\n- people driving, riding a motorcycle or cycling must give way to people on a zebra crossing and people walking and cycling on a parallel crossing\nA parallel crossing is similar to a zebra crossing, but includes a cycle route alongside the black and white stripes.\n3. Walking, cycling or riding in shared spaces\nThere is new guidance in the code about routes and spaces which are shared by people walking, cycling and riding horses.\nPeople cycling, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle should respect the safety of people walking in these spaces, but people walking should also take care not to obstruct or endanger them.\nPeople cycling are asked to:\n- not pass people walking, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle closely or at high speed, particularly from behind\n- slow down when necessary and let people walking know they are there (for example, by ringing their bell)\n- remember that people walking may be deaf, blind or partially sighted\n- not pass a horse on the horse’s left\n4. Positioning in the road when cycling\nThere is updated guidance for people cycling about positioning themselves which includes:\n- riding in the centre of their lane on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions or road narrowings\n- keeping at least 0.5 metres (just over 1.5 feet) away from the kerb edge (and further where it is safer) when riding on busy roads with vehicles moving faster than them\nPeople cycling in groups\nThe updated code explains that people cycling in groups:\n- should be considerate of the needs of other road users when riding in groups\n- can ride 2 abreast – and it can be safer to do so, particularly in larger groups or when accompanying children or less experienced riders\nPeople cycling are asked to be aware of people driving behind them and allow them to overtake (for example, by moving into single file or stopping) when it’s safe to do so.\nPeople cycling passing parked vehicles\nThe updated code explains that people cycling should:\n- take care when passing parked vehicles, leaving enough room (a door’s width or 1 metre) to avoid being hit if a car door is opened\n- watch out for people walking into their path\n5. Overtaking when driving or cycling\nThere is updated guidance on safe passing distances and speeds for people driving or riding a motorcycle when overtaking vulnerable road users, including:\n- leaving at least 1.5 metres (5 feet) when overtaking people cycling at speeds of up to 30mph, and giving them more space when overtaking at higher speeds\n- passing people riding horses or driving horse-drawn vehicles at speeds under 10 mph and allowing at least 2 metres (6.5 feet) of space\n- allowing at least 2 metres (6.5 feet) of space and keeping to a low speed when passing people walking in the road (for example, where there’s no pavement)\nWait behind them and do not overtake if it’s unsafe or not possible to meet these clearances.\nPeople cycling passing slower-moving or stationary traffic\nThe updated code confirms that people cycling may pass slower-moving or stationary traffic on their right or left.\nThey should proceed with caution as people driving may not be able to see them. This is particularly important:\n- on the approach to junctions\n- when deciding whether it is safe to pass lorries or other large vehicles\n6. People cycling at junctions\nThe code has been updated to clarify that when turning into or out of a side road, people cycling should give way to people walking who are crossing or waiting to cross.\nThere is new advice about new special cycle facilities at some junctions.\nSome junctions now include small cycle traffic lights at eye-level height, which may allow cyclists to move separately from or before other traffic. People cycling are encouraged to use these facilities where they make their journey safer and easier.\nThere is also new guidance for people cycling at junctions with no separate facilities.\nThe code recommends that people cycling should proceed as if they were driving a vehicle where there are no separate cyclist facilities. This includes positioning themselves in the centre of their chosen lane, where they feel able to do this safely. This is to:\n- make them as visible as possible\n- avoid being overtaken where this would be dangerous\nPeople cycling turning right\nThe code now includes advice for people cycling using junctions where signs and markings tell them to turn right in 2 stages. These are:\n- stage 1 – when the traffic lights turn green, go straight ahead to the location marked by a cycle symbol and turn arrow on the road, and then stop and wait\n- stage 2 – when the traffic lights on the far side of the junction (now facing the people cycling) turn green, complete the manoeuvre\nPeople cycling have priority when going straight ahead at junctions\nThe code clarifies that when people cycling are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.\nPeople cycling are asked to watch out for people driving intending to turn across their path, as people driving ahead may not be able to see them.\n7. People cycling, riding a horse and driving horse-drawn vehicles on roundabouts\nThe code has been updated to clarify that people driving or riding a motorcycle should give priority to people cycling on roundabouts. The new guidance will say people driving and or riding a motorcycle should:\n- not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane\n- allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout\nThe code already explained that people cycling, riding a horse and driving a horse-drawn vehicle may stay in the left-hand lane of a roundabout when they intend to continue across or around the roundabout.\nGuidance has been added to explain that people driving should take extra care when entering a roundabout to make sure they do not cut across people cycling, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle who are continuing around the roundabout in the left-hand lane.\n8. Parking, charging and leaving vehicles\nThe code recommends a new technique when leaving vehicles. It’s sometimes called the ‘Dutch Reach’.\nWhere people driving or passengers in a vehicle are able to do so, they should open the door using their hand on the opposite side to the door they are opening. For example, using their left hand to open a door on their right-hand side.\nThis will make them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them. They’re then less likely to cause injury to:\n- people cycling or riding a motorcycle passing on the road\n- people on the pavement\nUsing an electric vehicle charge point\nFor the first time, the code includes guidance about using electric vehicle charging points.\nWhen using one, people should:\n- park close to the charge point and avoid creating a trip hazard for people walking from trailing cables\n- display a warning sign if you can\n- return charging cables and connectors neatly to minimise the danger to other people and avoid creating an obstacle for other road users\nCOMMENT:\nThe law on the road is and always has been that pedestrians always have right of way, meaning that wherever there is a pedestrian in your path, you must let them cross, not plough in to them, no matter what the situation may be. In this case, there are many places where pedestrians MUST NOT CROSS until it is safe to do so, encouraging them to walk out on to roads anywhere, with the legal right to do so is actually putting them in danger.\nIt has always been the case the cyclists should be given adequate space, when passing but these changes will only serve to allow cyclists to antagonise motorists and the result will be catastrophic.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_understanding-the-laffer-curve/content_1163.html": "Understanding the Laffer Curve\nUnlocking the Mysteries of the Laffer Curve: Taxation and Government Revenue\nThe world of economics is rife with theories, graphs, and equations that attempt to decipher the intricate dance between government taxation and revenue generation. One such concept that has captured the imagination of policymakers, economists, and the general public alike is the Laffer curve. This theoretical curve offers a fascinating perspective on how tax rates influence government tax revenue. In this blog post, we’ll explore the Laffer curve, its origins, implications, and real-world applications.\nThe Laffer Curve Unveiled\nThe Laffer curve, named after supply-side economist Arthur Laffer, is a graphical representation of the relationship between tax rates and government tax revenue. At its core, it suggests that there exists an optimal tax rate that maximizes government revenue. According to the Laffer curve, tax revenue is nil at both the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100%. Hence, there must be a sweet spot somewhere between these two extremes where tax revenue reaches its zenith.\nThe curve’s shape is intricately linked to the concept of taxable income elasticity. In simpler terms, it means how people respond to changes in tax rates. Laffer’s representation typically begins at a 0% tax rate, yielding zero revenue, gradually climbs to a point where tax revenue peaks, and then descends again to zero at a 100% tax rate. However, it’s important to note that the exact shape of the curve remains a point of contention among economists.\nThe Implications of the Laffer Curve\nOne significant implication of the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point becomes counterproductive for raising more tax revenue. This concept has been particularly influential in the United States, where conservatives have used it to argue that lower taxes can, paradoxically, lead to higher tax revenue. Nevertheless, it’s important to highlight that determining the precise maximum revenue point on the Laffer curve for any specific market is a challenging task, often fraught with controversy. Estimates of revenue-maximizing income tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range estimate of around 70%.\nA Napkin and a Meeting: The Birth of the Laffer Curve\nThe Laffer curve gained notoriety in the United States during an afternoon meeting in 1974, attended by Arthur Laffer, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and others from the Ford Administration. Legend has it that Laffer sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument against President Gerald Ford’s proposed tax increase. The term “Laffer curve” was coined by Jude Wanniski, who was also present at the meeting. However, it’s worth noting that the basic idea of the Laffer curve was not entirely novel, with roots traced back to thinkers like the 14th-century social philosopher Ibn Khaldun and economists like John Maynard Keynes and Adam Smith.\nHistorical Precedents and Controversy\nThe Laffer curve is not without historical precedents. Figures like Andrew Mellon, the Secretary of the Treasury in the 1920s, advocated for tax cuts as a means to boost revenue. Mellon’s approach, reducing the top income tax bracket from 73% to 24%, was met with success, as personal income tax receipts increased significantly during his tenure.\nHowever, the Laffer curve’s real-world applicability remains a subject of debate. A 2012 survey of economists found that the majority rejected the idea that tax cuts would lead to increased revenue, especially in the context of federal US income taxes.\nEmpirical Analysis and Revenue Maximization\nOne practical use of the Laffer curve is to determine the tax rate that maximizes government revenue. This rate should not be confused with the optimal tax rate, which seeks to raise revenue with minimal economic distortion. Various studies have estimated revenue-maximizing tax rates, with results often clustering around 70%.\nBeyond Income Tax: Goods and Services\nThe Laffer curve’s principles have been extended to the taxation of goods and services. Recent research has emphasized the importance of considering firms’ strategic pricing responses in non-competitive markets when estimating the Laffer curve. This can impact the revenue-maximizing tax rate and its location.\nCongressional Budget Office Analysis\nIn 2005, the United States Congressional Budget Office analyzed the economic and budgetary effects of a 10% cut in income tax rates. Their findings suggested that, even in generous growth scenarios, only a fraction of the lost revenue would be recouped over a decade. This means that deficits would increase significantly after a tax cut, offsetting the benefits.\nThe UK Perspective\nIn the United Kingdom, the reduction of the top income tax rate from 50% to 45% in 2013 sparked a debate on the Laffer curve. The HMRC estimated the cost of this tax reduction, suggesting that the UK was potentially near the peak of the Laffer curve.\nIn conclusion, the Laffer curve serves as a thought-provoking concept that highlights the intricate relationship between tax rates and government revenue. While it has been influential in policy discussions, its real-world applicability remains a topic of debate among economists. Understanding the Laffer curve can provide valuable insights into tax policy decisions, but its complexities should always be considered in context.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_eu-to-impose-more-censorship-on-free-speech/content_53.html": "EU to impose more censorship on free speech\nThe European Union has decisively intensified its efforts to regulate online discourse, introducing a comprehensive framework that purportedly aims to protect democratic principles whilst simultaneously raising significant concerns about potential censorship. The Digital Services Act (DSA) represents a sweeping initiative by Brussels bureaucrats to establish stringent controls over digital communication across the European continent.\nAt the core of this legislative endeavour is a robust mechanism for addressing what the EU defines as “illegal content”, with a particular emphasis on online hate speech. The legislation mandates that platforms swiftly assess and potentially remove content deemed inappropriate, with an extraordinarily tight 24-hour window for evaluation. This rapid response requirement has provoked considerable debate about the potential for hasty judgements and the suppression of legitimate discourse.\nThe EU’s approach fundamentally hinges on a principle that what is considered illegal offline should equally be prohibited online. This seemingly straightforward premise masks a complex landscape of potential interpretation and enforcement. By the conclusion of the current year, the EU plans to deploy approximately 200 staff members dedicated specifically to enforcing these digital regulations—a substantial bureaucratic machinery aimed at policing online communication.\nCritics argue that the legislation represents a thinly veiled attempt to control narratives and silence dissenting voices. The concern stems from the subjective nature of defining hate speech and the potential for overzealous enforcement. The fact-checking measures proposed under the DSA have been particularly scrutinised, with allegations that such mechanisms might be used to propagate specific ideological perspectives rather than ensuring objective information verification.\nThe geopolitical context surrounding this legislation is equally intriguing. The potential return of certain political figures in other regions, coupled with tech companies’ evolving stance on content moderation, appears to have significantly influenced the EU’s regulatory approach. The EU leadership characterises tech companies’ support for broader free speech principles as a potential threat to democratic processes—a stance that many argue is paradoxical, given that free expression is traditionally considered fundamental to democratic societies.\nThe legislation’s scope is remarkably broad, encompassing not just EU-wide regulations but also incorporating the diverse and sometimes restrictive speech laws of its 27 member states. This creates a complex regulatory environment where content could be deemed illegal based on the most restrictive interpretation across multiple jurisdictions.\nPractical implementation presents significant challenges. Technology platforms will be required to continuously monitor content, make rapid judgements on complex issues, and potentially censor material that might be considered perfectly acceptable in other global contexts. This approach fails to acknowledge the nuanced variations in cultural expression and linguistic context.\nPerhaps the most profound concern is the potential “chilling effect” on free expression. When individuals become aware they are under constant scrutiny, with the possibility of immediate content removal or potential legal consequences, they are likely to self-censor. This psychological mechanism could fundamentally undermine the spontaneity and creativity that characterise open digital discourse.\nSupporters of the legislation argue that some regulatory framework is necessary to prevent genuine harmful content. However, critics contend that the proposed measures are disproportionate, potentially representing an Orwellian approach to digital communication that prioritises control over genuine democratic dialogue.\nThe broader implications extend far beyond European borders. If successfully implemented, these regulations could establish a precedent for online content moderation globally, potentially influencing how digital platforms approach free speech in other regions.\nUltimately, the debate encapsulates a fundamental tension in the digital age: balancing the protection of individuals from genuinely harmful content while preserving the fundamental right to free expression. The EU’s Digital Services Act represents a significant, albeit controversial, attempt to navigate this complex terrain.\nThe legislation demands ongoing scrutiny, with citizens and digital rights advocates encouraged to remain vigilant about potential overreach. The preservation of free speech requires constant defence, and the implementation of these regulations will undoubtedly be watched closely by legal experts, technology platforms, and civil liberties organisations worldwide.\nSummary of the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA):\n• Purpose: Regulate online content across the European Union, focusing on removing “illegal” digital content within 24 hours\n• Key Components:\n– Mandates rapid assessment of potential hate speech\n– Establishes 200-member enforcement team\n– Applies laws from all 27 EU member states\n– Covers major tech platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok\n• Primary Concerns:\n– Potential for broad censorship\n– Risk of suppressing legitimate speech\n– Subjective definition of “hate speech”\n– Possible chilling effect on free expression\n• Enforcement Mechanism:\n– Platforms must quickly evaluate and potentially remove content\n– Applies offline legal standards to online communication\n– Includes extensive fact-checking measures\n• Broader Implications:\n– Could set global precedent for online content moderation\n– Significant burden on technology companies\n– Potential threat to cultural and linguistic diversity of online communication\n• Controversial Aspects:\n– Interpreted by critics as narrative control\n– Perceived threat to democratic free speech principles\n– Possibility of ideological bias in content removal\n• Potential Consequences:\n– Self-censorship by users\n– Reduced innovation and creative expression\n– Increased digital surveillance",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_bbc-misrepresented-covid-risk-to-boost-lockdown-support/content_436.html": "BBC ‘misrepresented’ Covid risk to boost lockdown support\nUnveiling the BBC’s Alleged Misrepresentation of Covid Risk: A Critical Inquiry\nIntroduction:\nIn a recent development, the UK Covid Inquiry has heard accusations that the BBC played a role in “misrepresenting” the risk posed by Covid to the public in order to garner support for lockdown measures. Professor Mark Woolhouse, an esteemed epidemiologist and government adviser, criticized the corporation for repeatedly reporting rare deaths among healthy adults as if they were the norm, creating a misleading impression about the severity of the virus. This revelation raises questions about the impact such reporting may have had on public perception and government decision-making during the early stages of the pandemic.\nThe Allegations:\nProf Woolhouse asserted that the BBC’s coverage contributed to a misconception that everyone was at equal risk of severe outcomes from Covid, while in reality, the risk varied significantly across age groups. He highlighted that the known risk of dying from Covid was 10,000 times higher in individuals over 75 compared to those under 15. The alleged misrepresentation, according to Prof Woolhouse, persisted throughout 2020 and may have provided justification for the widespread implementation of lockdowns.\nThe Impact on Government Messaging:\nThe professor cited a briefing from March 22, 2020, by a sub-group of the UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that focused on shaping public behavior. The briefing suggested that some people did not feel sufficiently threatened, and efforts were needed to increase the perceived level of personal threat, potentially through emotional messaging. Prof Woolhouse argued that the misperception created by the BBC’s reporting hindered the ability to target interventions specifically at the vulnerable minority who were at the highest risk.\nConcerns about the Scottish Government’s Response:\nIn his written submission to the inquiry, Prof Woolhouse expressed concerns that the Scottish Government’s pandemic response may have been compromised due to the alleged misrepresentation of the Covid risk. He emphasized that the “climate of fear” existing during the pandemic, as described by some BBC journalists, may have influenced decision-making at both the national and regional levels.\nExpert Insights:\nProf Woolhouse, who served as an adviser to the Scottish Government during the pandemic, concluded that lockdown measures were least effective at protecting the most vulnerable. He pointed out that individuals in high-risk groups, particularly the elderly, had unavoidable contacts with healthcare and social care workers, making self-isolation impractical.\nBBC’s Response:\nA BBC spokesperson defended the corporation’s reporting, stating that they followed rigorous editorial standards, using official and scientific sources. They emphasized that the BBC provided ongoing analysis from a range of medical and scientific experts, including voices skeptical of lockdowns.\nConclusion:\nThe allegations of misrepresentation by the BBC raise important questions about media responsibility during times of crisis. As the inquiry unfolds, it will be crucial to examine the potential impact of such reporting on public understanding, government decisions, and the overall management of the pandemic. The revelations also underscore the need for transparency and accuracy in media reporting, particularly during health crises with significant societal implications.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-immigration-will-not-solve-the-falling-birth-rate-crisis/content_22.html": "Why immigration will not solve the falling birth rate crisis\nAs the competition for migrants increases, immigration cannot solve the problem of fertility below replacement levels.\nIntroduction\nOver the past half century, mass immigration at historically unprecedented scales has transformed many developed countries. From the United States to Western Europe and wealthy Asia-Pacific nations like Australia, large immigrant communities have become an integral part of both the population makeup and labour markets.\nThis mass migration is primarily driven by major global demographic shifts – chiefly the significant population growth occurring in lower income countries at the same time as population decline sets in within more developed nations due to sub-replacement fertility. With birth rates in almost all advanced economies now far below replacement levels, immigration is increasingly viewed by many as an indispensable tool to offset domestic population loss and workforce aging. But is large-scale immigration truly a viable permanent solution to low birth rates in rich countries? This in-depth analysis aims to explore the complex interplay between demographics, immigration and the economy in aging developed societies.\nThe Demographic Transition and Emergence of Global Population Imbalances\nContemporary patterns of mass migration are inextricably linked to the demographic transition which has unfolded across the globe over the past two centuries. To understand why immigration flows look the way they do today, we must first comprehend how the demographic transition has radically reshaped population structures in both developing and developed regions.\nPre-Transition Population Dynamics\nFor almost all of human history until the mid-18th century, population dynamics were characterized by both high birth rates and high death rates. In pre-industrial agricultural societies, women tended to give birth to between 5-8 children on average over their lifetimes. However, due to very high infant and child mortality rates, often only 2-3 children survived to adulthood and had children themselves.\nThis pattern of high fertility and high mortality kept population growth low. Famines, wars and plagues could easily wipe out population gains over generations. Life expectancy fluctuated but was often around 30-40 years. Populations were stable and in equilibrium – demographic sustainability through tragic limitation.\nThe Mortality Revolution\nThis longstanding population equilibrium began to shift in Northwestern Europe from the mid-1700s. In countries like England and the Netherlands, infant mortality rates started to gradually decline thanks to improvements in medical knowledge, public hygiene, sanitation infrastructure and nutrition.\nFewer babies and children now perished to infectious diseases like smallpox, measles and cholera. However, birth rates still remained high, with most women continuing to give birth to 5-8 children over a lifetime based on established societal norms. This combination of persistent high fertility but substantially lower child mortality sparked population growth, as more children survived to adulthood and had large families themselves.\nOver the next century and a half, accelerating innovations and dissemination of public health interventions caused infant and child mortality to plummet further in Northwestern Europe and populations expanded rapidly as a result. The population of England nearly tripled from 1750 to 1850. This phenomenon spread across Europe and European settler colonies like the United States and Canada throughout the 19th century.\nDeveloping better medical treatments and improving sanitary conditions had overturned millennia of population equilibrium – but further revolution was yet to come.\nFertility Decline and Demographic Dividend\nThe next phase of the demographic transition saw fertility rates fall from their historical highs down towards replacement level alongside the prior mortality revolution. As countries industrialized and urbanized, traditional rural agricultural lifestyles were upended. Whereas large families were economically beneficial in agrarian society, children became costlier for city-dwelling factory workers and white-collar professionals.\nFemale education and workforce participation also tended to reduce fertility, as having ongoing pregnancies became more disruptive. Cultural and religious norms promoting high fertility gradually shifted too.\nThis fertility decline towards near replacement-level birth rates took place over decades rather than years, with older generations still having large families according to long-established customs. But by the mid-20th century, average fertility in developed countries stabilized around 2 children per woman – far below historical averages of 6 or more children per woman just a century prior.\nRapidly declining child mortality followed by substantial reductions in fertility over the span of a century fundamentally altered population structures. Falling mortality followed by falling fertility created a “demographic dividend” – an unprecedentedly large working-age population with far fewer dependent children and elderly than ever before in history.\nFor countries that underwent this transition early like Britain and Germany, this dividend underpinned economic growth and geopolitical dominance during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Their populations tripled or even quintupled as they enjoyed the fruits of mortality and fertility declines.\nGlobal Diffusion of the Demographic Transition\nThe demographic transition commenced in Northwestern Europe but gradually diffused outwards to other parts of the globe over the next two centuries. Societies across the planet underwent the transition’s mortality and fertility declines at very different times.\nThose societies entering the transition earlier completed the process by today and saw their populations stabilize or begin shrinking due to fertility falling below death rates. Regions entering the transition later are still experiencing rapid population growth as their mortality revolution spreads but the behavioral and cultural shifts behind fertility decline take longer.\nSignificantly, improvements in health technology enabled later developing regions to attain far lower infant and child mortality rates than European countries had at similar stages of development and income. In the mid-19th century, 15-20% of British children perished in their first 5 years of life. Today, this child mortality rate is achieved by Sub-Saharan African societies with per capita incomes below $1000.\nThis helps explain why regions entering the demographic transition later have undergone even more massive population expansions. While Britain’s population quadrupled during its transition between 1750-1950, Nigeria’s population grew almost 15-fold during a similar 200 year period. Overall, Sub-Saharan Africa’s population grew more than 5-fold between 1950 and 2022.\nRapidly developing countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa also saw their populations grow 3-5 fold over the past 70 years due to belated demographic transitions.\nEmergence of Global Demographic Imbalances\nThe global diffusion of the demographic transition at varying times and paces has given rise to stark differences in population structure and growth trajectories between the developed and developing worlds:\n– Most developed countries completed demographic transition by the mid to late 20th century and now have slowly growing or outright shrinking populations due to sub-replacement fertility. Populations are aging rapidly with median ages rising into the 40-45 range.\n– Many developing regions are still undergoing demographic transition and experiencing rapid population growth due to past declines in child mortality coupled with lingering high fertility. Their populations have very youthful structures with median ages in the teens to mid-20s range.\nThis situation where wealthy countries have shrinking aging populations while poorer regions undergo massive population booms sets the scene for the modern era of mass migration. The economic incentives for large-scale movement from developing to developed countries are clear and growing stronger over time as demographic gaps widen further.\nBefore analyzing contemporary migration flows and their economic impact, it is worth exploring why attitudes to immigration in receiving countries underwent a major liberalizing shift in the decades after World War 2.\nThe Post-WW2 Shift in Attitudes Towards Immigration in Developed Countries\nDuring the first major era of globalization from the mid-19th to early 20th century, migration within Europe and from Europe to settler societies like the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand was common. But whether voluntary or forced, these flows were seen as settlers colonizing lands perceived as empty or underutilized rather than “immigration” to populated nation states.\nAttitudes towards immigration as we conceptualize it today really coalesced in the early 20th century as ideas of the nation state matured. From the 1900s to the 1940s, public attitudes and government policies in most developed countries were decidedly anti-immigration. The United States imposed strict racially defined immigration quotas in the 1920s. Even European countries were generally opposed to immigration from elsewhere in Europe, never mind further afield.\nBut views gradually shifted in the decades after 1945 due to a mix of economic necessity, post-colonial guilt and genuine open mindedness. This allowed the modern onrush of immigration to rich countries to accelerate.\nPost-WW2 Labour Shortages\nThe massive destruction and loss of life during the Second World War left many combatant countries with severe labour shortages just as they embarked on national rebuilding and economic revitalization. Combined with the immediate post-war baby boom, this created a huge demand for workers that could not be met domestically.\nCountries like Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands turned to immigration from former colonies to help fill this gap. Over a million Algerians settled in France from 1945-1965 for instance. The United States lifted racially restrictive immigration laws to allow more immigration from Asia and Latin America. Hundreds of thousands of Turkish guest workers helped rebuild West Germany after the war.\nFor around 2-3 decades after 1945, governments and publics generally viewed this labour immigration as a temporary necessity to aid postwar reconstruction – not as a permanent transformation of their societies through diversity. But as economic dependence on these migrant worker communities grew, return became less likely.\nAnti-Racism and Diversity\nAlongside labour needs, the anti-racism movement that gathered steam from the 1950s onwards made overt expressions of xenophobia towards immigrants increasingly taboo. Civil rights struggles made discrimination based on race, ethnicity or country of origin seem backwards.\nWithin elite cultural circles, this morphed into glorification of diversity as an ethical good in itself regardless of economic considerations. Multiculturalism, positive racial discrimination and relaxed immigration policies became markers of enlightened progressivism.\nDemographic Need for Immigration\nMass immigration continued and even accelerated after the initial postwar labour shortages ended because fertility decline left Western countries facing shrinking workforces and aging populations.\nJust as domestic fertility fell below replacement levels from the late 1960s and 1970s, developing countries were experiencing massive population booms due to belated mortality transitions discussed earlier. This supplied huge numbers of young working-age people in regions like North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia looking for economic opportunities abroad.\nRather than grapple with the underlying demographic challenge of sub-replacement fertility, immigration became seen as a quick fix that enabled continued growth without social upheaval. More diverse societies were also increasingly seen as intrinsically positive.\nThis combination of labour needs, anti-racism and demographic pressures drove a sweeping liberalization of attitudes towards mass immigration in the developed world over the postwar decades. With expanded public tolerance as cover, policymakers pursued more open immigration policies to drive economic growth.\nBut does rising dependence on immigration to sustain economic expansion and counter aging populations make long-term sense for advanced economies?\nThe Economic Reliance on Immigration in Aging Developed Countries\nWhile some ideologically driven open borders proponents support massive immigration on principle regardless of economic impact, mainstream defenders of high immigration point to its supposed economic benefits. Let us dispassionately examine the purported economic upsides of large migrant influxes as well as the long-term demographic challenges mass immigration creates or obscures.\nDo Immigrants Boost GDP Growth?\nThe most common argument made by the pro-immigration economic establishment is that influxes of working-age immigrants expand the labour force, which expands overall economic output and GDP growth.\nWith domestic fertility below replacement level, native workforces are aging and shrinking in most advanced economies. Immigration helps counteract this by adding younger workers not subject to the population momentum of sub-replacement fertility driving domestic demographic decline.\nHowever, recent research increasingly calls into question the extent to which immigration actually boosts GDP per capita versus simply expanding aggregate GDP via bigger populations. After analysis of two decades of data from 22 OECD countries, researchers found little impact of immigration on per capita economic growth or incomes.\nThis suggests the primary benefit is increased tax revenues, profits and overall economic output enjoyed by elites and corporations from having more people and workers – not prosperity for average citizens.\nDo Immigrants Boost Innovation?\nAnother argument is that an influx of diverse talent from abroad makes countries more dynamic and innovative. Silicon Valley provides strong anecdotal evidence of immigrant entrepreneurs like Elon Musk or Sergey Brin driving technological innovation in America.\nHowever, high-skilled immigrants tend to cluster in enclaves like Silicon Valley rather than dispersing across the broader economy. Overall, immigrants are usually overrepresented at both ends of the skills spectrum – in elite knowledge economy jobs but also low-skill manual labour. The economic benefits of highly educated immigrants primarily accrue to large urban hubs rather than nationwide.\nDo Immigrants Support Aging Societies?\nThe most salient economic rationale for immigration to developed countries is bolstering aged care and social services in top-heavy populations with swelling retiree cohorts and relatively fewer working-age people to support them. Immigration helps correct this imbalance.\nYoung immigrants largely concentrate in the 20-45 age bracket strongly represented in the labour force. They pay taxes to support rising health and pension costs in aging populations they join but make fewer claims on these services themselves initially.\nHowever, immigrants also grow old. After working and paying taxes for 35-40 years, migrant workers will qualify for the same pensions and aged care benefits as native-born retirees. Failure to account for immigrants’ future old-age costs makes immigration appear like a bigger fiscal boon than it truly is.\nDo Native Workers Benefit?\nAlthough large influxes of immigrants undoubtedly benefit overall GDP on paper, the economic effects for incumbent native workers are more mixed. Immigrants compete with natives in specific sectors like trades and services rather than the whole economy. This can depress wages and reduce job options for both low and middle skill native workers.\nCareful targeting of immigration towards genuine skills shortages is important to minimise negative effects on native workers. Current policies focused on overall numbers often overlook structural mismatches. An oversupply of low-skill migrants does little good if there are shortages of doctors, nurses and technicians.\nEconomic Impacts: Summary\nIn summary, current high levels of immigration:\n– Support overall GDP growth via increased population and labour supply\n– Modestly benefit corporate profits and government budgets. But gains are limited per capita.\n– Provide some skilled talent for knowledge industries. But too narrow to transform whole economies.\n– Help address aging society challenges if migrants stay employed. But long-term fiscal boost exaggerated.\n– Risk harming wages and job prospects for many native workers if numbers are not carefully calibrated to skills gaps.\nThe economic upsides of mass immigration are positive but relatively narrow in scope. But perhaps more importantly, large migrant influxes do little to address the root causes of population aging and shrinking workforces in advanced economies.\nWhy Immigration Only Delays Rather Than Solves Population Decline\nGiven most developed countries now endure sub-replacement fertility, immigration cannot reverse national population aging and decline indefinitely without even greater migrant influxes over time. At best, it buys time by filling short-term human resource gaps. The underlying demographic challenge still remains unsolved.\nThe Temporary Demographic Fix\nImmigration acts as a temporary fix for aging developed societies by injecting mostly working-age labour. This tops up the workforce and broadens the tax base. But immigrant populations exhibit the same sub-replacement fertility trends as host countries after a generation or two.\nThe key statistic is the total fertility rate (TFR) – the average number of children each woman has over her lifetime. The minimum TFR to naturally replace deaths with new births is around 2.1 children per woman in advanced economies.\nEast Asian and Southern European countries have very low TFRs of 1.2-1.4. Northern and Western Europe average 1.6-1.9. The white American TFR is 1.7 while Hispanic immigrants are at 2.0. Canadian, Australian and New Zealand fertility rates range between 1.5 and 1.8.\nThese below replacement TFRs mean that after the postwar baby boom echo generations fade, populations will decline without immigration. For example, America’s TFR has been between 1.7-2.1 for decades. Immigration is the sole reason its population keeps growing overall despite sub-replacement fertility rates.\nBut what happens to immigrants after a generation or two? Every immigrant group that has lived in America for an extended period now exhibits similar TFRs to native-born Americans, from 19th century Irish Catholics to early 20th century Jews and Italians.\nMore recent arrivals like Mexicans, Chinese and Indians display higher initial fertility. But just like prior immigrant groups, their TFRs decline over time and converge with wider societal norms around family size.\nThis pattern repeats worldwide. Once immersed in advanced post-industrial societies, immigrants do not keep reproducing above the native fertility rate indefinitely. They become subject to the same cultural values and economic constraints that limit family size, from women’s education and employment to housing costs.\nWithout ongoing mass arrival of new immigrants, immigrant-origin populations exhibit sub-replacement fertility just like the incumbent population after a couple of generations. Immigration offers temporary respite from declining workforces but does not resolve the underlying lack of births driving it. It merely buys time.\nEver Increasing Dependency on Immigration\nThe developed world has enjoyed a ‘sweet spot’ period for immigration since the 1990s. Fertility decline left countries needing more workers. Meanwhile developing regions still had high birth rates and young populations eager to migrate. This allowed a win-win situation of population stabilization via immigration.\nHowever, developing regions are now moving through the demographic transition themselves with sharply slowing population growth as their fertility rates fall. United Nations population forecasts show peak population being reached within decades in East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East as a whole.\nSub-Saharan Africa will be the main remaining high fertility zone. But with low education levels and skills, it cannot fill substantial labour gaps in knowledge economies. Plus, China and now Russia are looking to Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia to drive their own immigration programs as populations decline.\nTherefore, the pool of potential new immigrants accessible to developed countries is set to shrink dramatically relative to population size over coming decades. But since fertility will likely remain sub-replacement, aging societies will need immigrant labour more than ever.\nThis means immigration flows would have to expand continuously to fill ever larger labour force gaps, as each immigrant cohort goes through the same fertility transitions. Rather than a temporary supplement to stabilize aging societies, mass immigration becomes a cycle of endless, exponentially growing dependency with increasingly scarce inputs.\nPonzi Demographics?\nHypothetically, if fertility remained below replacement then immigration would have to keep stepping up every generation for population stabilization.\nEach generation of immigrants would be numerically smaller than the last as fertility declines. So more newcomers would always be needed to maintain a steady workforce and broad-based population pyramid.\nTaken to its logical conclusion, ever rising immigration could hypothetically “Ponzi-fy” the population structures of developed countries. The working-age population could be constantly replenished",

Yugoslavia was first established as an ambitious attempt promoted by the Allied Powers to overcome the Region’s endemic sectarian divisions through forging an artificial new South Slavic nation-state unifying the explosive patchwork of freshly-liberated Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosniaks alongside various other Slavic nationalities dominating the lands situated between the Adriatic and Black Seas.\nHowever, the interwar Yugoslavian project quickly floundered amid resistance from dauntingly complex ethno-religious tensions possessing extensive historical baggage ultimately impossible to transcend through mere idealism and constitutional engineering alone. Harsh centralized rule imposed by Serbia’s Karađorđević monarchical dynasty to hold this fractious Yugoslav creature together inevitably collapsed when invaded by the Axis during early 1941. A bitterly divided Yugoslavia emerged from WWII’s devastation, but also now firmly locked inside the Soviet sphere.\nJosip Broz Tito and his victorious Partisan Movement simultaneously fought rival ethnic nationalist militias and the Nazis. Once in control, Tito quickly understood reviving interwar Yugoslavia’s model attempting to force unity under a single national identity was doomed given the evident fragility of what’s essentially an artificial state. Seeking an alternative approach, Tito’s Communist regime channeled Yugoslavia’s intractable diversity into a drastically decentralised socialist federation established along nominal ethno-geographic lines comprising Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia plus Slovenia all unified within a single Marxist state formally structured to balance competing nationalisms coexisting rather than trying eliminating them.\nTito’s transformative model successfully maintained its delicate equilibrium keeping Yugoslavia thriving for decades as Communism’s collapse elsewhere strangely seemed to strengthen his prestige by eliciting greater dependence on his persona alone holding everything together. But Tito’s death in 1980 removed this pivotal lynchpin. Creeping economic stagnation and political paralysis during the 1980s eroded faith in Yugoslav institutions. The autocratic federation’s flawed design still denied proper self-determination towards constituent groups. Once free elections enabled surge’s in nationalism everything rapidly imploded.\nBloody Disintegration across Ethnic Lines\nDespite Slovenia and Croatia’s drift towards independence as the Cold War ended, Serbia’s Communist old guard backed by the numerically dominant Serbs violently suppressed moderate reformist pushes maintaining Yugoslavia’s unity, naively hoping to recentralize power under their control. However Slovenia by 1991 overwhelmingly voted to pursue exiting Yugoslavia regardless, igniting the fuse. Croatia shortly followed.\nAs both seceded that year, large Serb minorities within Croatia aligned with Belgrade rejected separation instead declaring independence themselves.lenamelyabreakaway mini-state named the Republic of Serbian Krajina. Likewise Bosnia’s Orthodox Serbs, enums fearful of potential future domination by rival Bosniaks and Croats within a dissolving Yugoslavia also moved to pre-emptively declare their own autonomous statelet Republika Srpska during 1992 aiming to secede outright and potentially integrate into Serbia instead should Bosnia too declare independence. Both Serbian breakaway regions wished securing access towards uniting with Serbia proper.\nFearing these aggressive Serb moves aimed at fragmenting their freshly declared homelands to annex chunks, Croatia plus Bosnia’s terrified governments hurriedly requested UN recognition and dispatched hastily prepared forces to regain control. Localised fighting soon transitioned into outright war. Bosnia’s military situation devolved into a disjointed three-way conflict embroiling Bosniaks, Serbs then the Croats. From 1992 until 1995 these interconnected wars plagued both Croatia and Bosnia characterized by campaigns of cultural destruction, horrific atrocities and systematic calculated ethnic cleansing ultimately leaving over 140 thousand dead alongside millions more displaced.\nThe Road to Dayton in Bosnia\nBosnia’s war exposed Europe’s limitations in effectively responding towards containing the Yugoslav crisis. UN peacekeepers deployed under light mandates froze upon encountering the war’s messy reality. Meanwhile the UN Security Council remained constantly deadlocked. Unable to intervene directly, major powers like the United States initially pushed urging Bosnia’s factions negotiate some sustainable power-sharing framework themselves at talks within Switzerland and later Ohio. However all past failures to build inter-ethnic state models across the Balkans suggested slim hopes for success.\nSure enough, negotiations utterly failed to overcome the simmering security dilemma poisoning Bosnia’s groups towards seeing coexistence under any shared governmental framework guaranteeing their rivals disproportionate influence as an unacceptable existential threat requiring elimination by any means. The initially dominant Bosnian Serb forces sheltering behind Belgrade’s support pushed onwards trying securing as much territory as feasible before international inertia faded. Systematic aggression campaigns involving mass executions, concentration camps and bombardment against predominantly Bosniak zones enabled conquest of around two-thirds of Bosnia’s territory by 1993, deliberately carving out a contiguous ethnically purified Republika Srpska.\nHorrendous Serb atrocities most vividly highlighted by the July 1995 Srebrenica Genocide finally terminated western hesitation. With Russia now conciliatory after Yugoslavia’s socialist collapse and President Clinton prioritizing broader NATO credibility reinforcement over congressional isolationists, America finally lent robust diplomatic pressure alongside concrete threats of force supporting revived efforts toward negotiations. Extensive NATO bombing coercion campaigns targeting Serb military assets paired with Croat-Bosniak battlefield victories overstretched their forces. Bleeding and encircled, Republika Srpska’s leadership finally acquiesced.\nAll parties by December 1995 accepted the Dayton Accords – an externally-drafted peace deal demarcating Bosnia’s internal boundaries along present lines of control and establishing an elaborate new constitution devised to balance aspirations for self-determination under autonomous entities with state integrity through decentralized power-sharing. The NATO-backed Office of High Representatives was set up to broadly oversee Dayton’s implementation. A 60 thousand strong implementation force would guarantee security allowing rebuild and refugee resettlements. Superficially, peace had won out at last.\nControversially Entrenching Division\nYet the Dayton framework has instead basically entrenched Bosnia’s bitter divisions rather than genuinely resolving them. Bosnia was essentially partitioned along ethnic lines into two entities reflecting the warring sides – the Bosniak-Croat ‘Federation’ controlling 51% versus the ‘Republika Srpska’ controlling 49%. The later territory was cleansed of non-Serbs during brutal aggression campaigns legitimized through Dayton’s boundaries. Minor returns and restitutions have ensued since, however Bosnia today remains heavily segregated. No substantive progress towards reconciliation or justice has occurred either, perpetuating lingering resentments.\nAdditionally, Dayton’s elaborate power-sharing model has constructed what’s arguably an essentially ungovernable state by paralyzing decision-making. Required consensus across entities with opposing aspirations unsurprisingly fuels frequent political",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_tony-blair-and-operation-ore/content_1064.html": "Tony Blair and Operation Ore\nBritain’s Largest Computer Crime Investigation\nHow much was really covered up?\nOperation Ore, launched in 1999, stands as the United Kingdom’s most extensive computer crime investigation to date. The operation, which stemmed from intelligence provided by American law enforcement, aimed to prosecute thousands of individuals suspected of accessing child abuse imagery through a website. The investigation’s scope was unprecedented, identifying 7,250 suspects and leading to 4,283 home searches across Britain.\nThe operation’s origins can be traced to an American investigation into Landslide Productions Inc., a Texas-based online pornography portal operated by Thomas and Janice Reedy. Following the Reedys’ conviction for trafficking illegal content in August 2001, the FBI launched “Operation Avalanche” in the United States. As part of their investigation, the FBI briefly operated the website as a sting operation to identify additional suspects. The American authorities subsequently shared their intelligence with international law enforcement agencies, including the details of 7,272 British suspects.\nThe British phase of the investigation, Operation Ore, commenced in May 2002. The scale of the operation placed unprecedented strain on British police resources, prompting appeals to the government for emergency funding. Several million pounds were ultimately allocated to the investigation, though this diversion of resources reportedly hampered other ongoing child protection investigations.\nThe operation garnered significant media attention in early 2003 when information about suspects was leaked to the press. The Sunday Times reported that the list included numerous prominent figures, including senior executives, teachers, military personnel, medical professionals, academics, civil servants, and several individuals from the entertainment industry. The leak proved controversial, with police expressing concern that it could enable suspects to destroy evidence before they could be apprehended.\nDespite its apparent initial success, with 3,744 arrests and 1,451 convictions, Operation Ore faced mounting criticism regarding its methodological rigour. Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell published a series of exposés in 2005 and 2007, highlighting significant flaws in the police’s approach. Unlike their American counterparts, British authorities failed to verify whether credit card holders in the Landslide database had actually accessed illegal content.\nOne of the operation’s most serious shortcomings emerged when investigators discovered 54,348 instances of stolen credit card information in the Landslide database. This revelation came seven years after the operation’s commencement and suggested that many innocent individuals had been wrongly targeted. The human cost was considerable: over 100 children were separated from their fathers during the two years it took police to acknowledge the extent of false accusations. Tragically, the operation is associated with approximately 33 suicides by 2007.\nSeveral high-profile cases highlighted the operation’s controversies. Musician Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack was later cleared of all charges, whilst The Who’s guitarist Pete Townshend received a police caution for accessing the Landslide website. Subsequent investigations revealed that both individuals had accessed unrelated content through the site. Actor Chris Langham was among those convicted.\nThe operation’s credibility faced further challenges when independent investigators obtained both database records and footage of the Landslide raid. In UK court proceedings, Michael Mead of the United States Postal Service contradicted his previous US testimony regarding several aspects of the investigation. These discrepancies led to a group action lawsuit in 2006, with falsely arrested individuals taking legal action against the operation’s detectives.\nThe controversy extended to expert witnesses involved in the case. Jim Bates, an independent computer expert who analysed hard drives during the investigation, was later convicted of making false statements and perjury regarding his qualifications. He was subsequently barred from appearing as an expert witness. Bates faced further legal troubles when he was arrested for possession of indecent images during his Operation Ore investigations, though a subsequent search of his home was ruled unlawful due to procedural errors.\nThe Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) and its chief executive, Jim Gamble, faced criticism for their defence of the operation, particularly their use of imprecise terminology that lacked recognised meaning within child protection or law enforcement contexts.\nThe operation’s legal standing was tested in December 2010 when the Court of Appeal heard the case of Anthony O’Shea. Senior judges rejected his appeal, stating they were “entirely confident that the appellant was rightly convicted.” The judgement dismissed O’Shea’s claims regarding IP address manipulation as “fanciful in the extreme.” This ruling was particularly significant as the case had been viewed as a potential precedent that could have led to the overturning of many Operation Ore convictions.\nOperation Ore represents a complex chapter in British law enforcement history. While it succeeded in identifying and prosecuting some genuine offenders, its methodological flaws and the resulting false accusations raise important questions about the balance between aggressive law enforcement and due process in the digital age. The operation’s legacy continues to influence discussions about the conduct of large-scale cybercrime investigations and the importance of robust procedural safeguards.\nSummary\n* According to Detective Chief Inspector Bob MacLachlan (former head of Scotland Yard’s paedophile unit), the operation faced significant challenges due to delays in making arrests, potentially allowing suspects to destroy evidence\n* At the time of reporting, only 1,200 arrests had been made out of an anticipated 7,000 suspects across the UK\n* A senior British intelligence source confirmed that at least one former Labour Cabinet Minister was among the Operation Ore suspects, though they could not be named for legal reasons\n* Reports indicated that a special cabinet committee had been established to manage potential political fallout for Tony Blair’s government if arrests were made\n* MacLachlan criticized claims of prioritizing pedophile crime as “smoke and mirrors,” noting that it wasn’t included in the Home Office’s National Policing Plan for 2003-06\n* The investigation team at Scotland Yard was reportedly under-resourced, with MacLachlan stating they were understaffed, overworked, underfunded, and reduced to using free software from computer magazines\n* The scale of online abuse material was vast:\n* Approximately one million images were found online\n* An estimated 20,000 individual children were depicted\n* Some seizures contained over 180,000 images\n* Images of 13,000 new children were discovered in the previous year\n* Only 17 child victims had been identified worldwide\n* Police sources indicated that the list of high-profile suspects would be sufficient to fill newspaper front pages for an entire year\n* The Internet Watch Foundation was developing software that could potentially remove child abuse material from the internet permanently, with an expected completion time of two years\n* The investigation had already led to the arrest of Detective Constable Brian Stevens in September 2002, who had been involved in the Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman murder investigation\nThe aftermath\nIt is alleged that Tony Blair issued a D-notice to the media, which are valid for 100 years, a petition to have that changed was declined and there is no current action being taken to expose the paedophiles who were at the heart of government.\nShould this be overturned? I believe it should.",

Scotland is 96% white, people of other races are basically guests in Scotland, yet rather than be grateful for the opportunity to live there, they are doing little more than increasingly make more and more demands, for over-representation in every aspect of life.\nThere comes a time, when people need to stop apologising for the way things are done in their own country, by people who have been granted the opportunity to live in this great country, but do nothing more than demand more and more concessions from their host nation. Whether they are first, second or third generation migrants, they are privileged to be here and should act accordingly, rather than continually demand that the host nation makes changes to suit them.\nThis man should be called our for what he is, a racist who is in a position that he would not be in, if he were white!\nLet that sink in!\nFull Transcript\nIn 99% of the meetings I go to, I’m the only non-white person in the room.

But to comprehend the migration emergency, we must scrutinize the preceding decades of Western military interventionism that destabilized the Middle East and Northern Africa.\nIn this post, I will:\n– Examine the timeline from 1990-present showing how foreign policy decisions sparked regional chaos\n– Highlight the lies that led to the devastating Iraq invasion in 2003\n– Discuss how toppling regimes empowered extremist groups\n– Show how the Arab Spring triggered mass displacement\n– Demonstrate the shared responsibility across US/UK party lines\n– Reflect on learning from the past to avoid perpetual conflict\nBy outlining this essential context, we gain insight into how short-sighted policies – often based on geopolitical profiteering rather than human rights – contributed to today’s refugee crisis. Reckoning with this recent history is vital if we hope to ethically address the current emergency.\nThe Road to Regional Chaos: Foreign Policy from 1990-2003\n– In the 90s, mixed messaging to Saddam before the Gulf War and false WMD claims built the case for aggression against Iraq.\n– Despite global protests, Bush and Blair’s 2003 Iraq invasion based on lies had devastating consequences, leaving a power vacuum.\n– With Saddam removed from power, Iraq descended into years of sectarian civil war, setting off a ripple effect across the region.\nThe Power Vacuum: How Regime Change Empowered Extremists\n– Groups like ISIS filled the void left by the Iraq war, flourishing amidst the instability and chaos.\n– The 2010 Arab Spring revolts swept across North Africa and the Middle East, ousting leaders in Egypt, Libya, and Yemen.\n– War broke out in Syria in 2011, devolving into one of the 21st century’s worst humanitarian crises.\nShared Responsibility: The Role of Western Leaders\n– Successive US administrations – Republican and Democrat – championed intervention despite blowback.\n– UK Conservative and Labour governments were also complicit in the Middle East quagmire.\n– European leaders made choices accelerating migration without preparation.\n– Their collective actions over decades contributed greatly to today’s refugee crisis.\nLearning Hard Lessons to Break the Cycle\nThe past 20+ years teach us key lessons if we hope to ethically address the current crisis:\n– Regime change causes instability and empowers extremist groups.\n– Wars justified by lies result in tremendous human suffering.\n– The refugee crisis results from sowing chaos abroad.\n– Ethical leadership requires centering human rights over profits/geopolitics.\n– Multilateral compassion for displaced peoples is needed now.\nWe must reckon with this history to make wise choices moving forward. The people of the Middle East have borne the brunt of foreign policy blunders. World leaders now face a moral reckoning. Will we continue failed interventions doomed to spark more blowback? Or will we learn lessons, act ethically, and choose a path of stability, human rights, cooperation, and peace?\nOur past need not be our future. We still have a chance to break the cycle. But only if we confront recent history with open eyes, take responsibility, and choose a wiser course, rooted in compassion.",

Departing from the traditional “pale, male, and stale” syllabus, the school is now focused on offering a wider range of texts by authors of color, female writers, and LGBTQ+ voices. This ambitious initiative aims to challenge prevailing ideologies and foster a more inclusive and empathetic learning environment.\n1. A Diverse Perspective: Expanding the Literary Canon\nThe curriculum at Alleyn’s School now proudly showcases works from a diverse array of authors. Students are encouraged to explore texts that represent queer readings, opening up discussions on gender, identity, and societal norms. Notably, the inclusion of the first non-binary author, Kae Tempest’s spoken-word album, “Let Them Eat Chaos,” is a significant milestone in acknowledging and celebrating diverse perspectives.\n2. Early Exposure to Female Authors: Empowering Key Stage 3 Pupils\nThe school recognizes the importance of countering gender inequality from an early age. Key Stage 3 pupils are introduced to novels written by female authors each year. This proactive approach encourages young minds to appreciate the richness and depth of literary expression from female voices.\n3. Broadening Horizons: Year 7 to Year 9 Reading Lists\nYear 7 students have the option to immerse themselves in the captivating worlds of either “Coram Boy” by Jamila Gavin or “Bone Talk” by Candy Gourlay. In Year 8, they encounter Susan Hill’s haunting classic, “The Woman In Black.” Moving to Year 9, pupils are presented with powerful works like “Kindred” by Octavia Butler, “Purple Hibiscus” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and “Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line” by Deepa Anappara. The reading list for Year 9 also features LGBTQ+ authors like Radclyffe Hall, showcasing the school’s commitment to inclusivity.\n4. Challenging Norms: Analyzing Canonical Texts\nThe school emphasizes that discussions on racial and gender equality, along with the challenging of prevailing ideologies, can coexist while studying canonical texts by white, cis-male authors. This approach offers a balanced and comprehensive understanding of literature while promoting critical thinking and empathy.\n5. Addressing Imbalance: The Need for Change in Education\nResearch by the campaign group End Sexism in Schools highlights the alarming disparity in set texts, with the majority being written by male authors, especially in modern prose and drama. Alleyn’s School’s progressive move seeks to address this imbalance and provide a more representative and inclusive literary education for its students.\n6. A Vision for the Future: Promoting Alternative Masculinities\nThe school’s commitment to representing “alternative versions of masculinity” is commendable. By challenging toxic masculinity and harmful stereotypes perpetuated in popular culture, the school paves the way for a more understanding and accepting society. Their approach to studying Macbeth’s masculinity at the GCSE level illustrates the consequences of toxic behavior, facilitating discussions on gender roles and expectations.\nConclusion:\nAlleyn’s School’s innovative transformation serves as an inspiring example for other educational institutions to follow. By embracing diverse voices and narratives, schools can foster a learning environment that celebrates empathy, understanding, and acceptance. Literature has the power to shape minds and perspectives, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that all voices are heard and valued in the pursuit of a more inclusive future.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-chancellor-is-using-fiscal-drag-as-a-stealth-tax/content_1141.html": "The Chancellor is using Fiscal Drag as a Stealth Tax\nFiscal Farce: Millions of Brits Dragged into Higher Tax Brackets\nA Lacklustre Budget for the Common Folk\nThe recent budget announcement by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has left many ordinary Britons feeling underwhelmed and concerned about their financial futures. While the reduction in National Insurance contributions may put some extra pennies in people’s pockets, experts argue that the real impact is overshadowed by the stealthy fiscal drag – a hidden tax that’s dragging millions into higher tax brackets.\nAs prices and wages rise, the frozen tax thresholds mean that more individuals are being pushed into higher tax bands, effectively paying more in taxes despite modest income increases. This phenomenon, known as fiscal drag, is impacting a significant portion of the workforce, including middle-ranking professionals such as teachers, police officers, and nurses – individuals who should not be classified as higher-rate taxpayers.\nThe Hidden Tax: Fiscal Drag Unmasked\nFiscal drag is a silent tax that often goes unmentioned in budget speeches and policy announcements. It’s a consequence of the government’s decision to freeze personal allowances and tax thresholds, resulting in more people being pushed into higher tax brackets as their incomes rise, even modestly.\nAs wages creep up to keep pace with inflation, individuals find themselves crossing the threshold from basic-rate taxpayers to higher-rate taxpayers, without necessarily experiencing a substantial improvement in their standard of living. This hidden tax is arguably more powerful in its impact than the headline tax cuts touted by the Chancellor.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility: Friend or Foe?\nOne of the key players in the budget saga is the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent fiscal watchdog tasked with providing economic forecasts and analysis. However, the accuracy of the OBR’s predictions has been called into question, with some arguing that its recent projections have been wide of the mark.\nThe OBR’s influence is undeniable, as evidenced by its role in scaling back the Chancellor’s initial plans for income tax cuts. Hunt had initially aimed for a 2p reduction in income tax, a move that would have benefited pensioners, landlords, and workers alike. However, the OBR’s pushback forced a compromise, resulting in the National Insurance cut instead.\nCritics argue that the OBR has become overly assertive, treating its forecasts as gospel and effectively dictating policy decisions. There are concerns that the watchdog has overstepped its bounds, wielding excessive power and potentially stifling measures that could provide much-needed relief to struggling households.\nGeopolitics and the Economy: A Volatile Mix\nAs the Chancellor attempts to navigate the economic landscape, the ongoing geopolitical turmoil adds another layer of complexity. The war in Ukraine, fluctuating oil and gas prices, and global instability have all contributed to the volatile economic climate, making it challenging to accurately predict future trends.\nWhile the government had initially hoped for incremental interest rate cuts by the Bank of England, coupled with tax reductions, to stimulate the economy, the shifting geopolitical dynamics have cast doubt on this strategy. Some analysts now suggest that inflation, initially expected to decrease to 2% in the summer, may start rising again, further complicating the economic outlook.\nA Glimmer of Hope: Potential for Autumn Tax Cuts\nDespite the challenges, there is still a glimmer of hope for those seeking tax relief. The Chancellor has hinted at the possibility of introducing tax cuts in an Autumn statement or spending review, ahead of the forthcoming general election.\nBy implementing tax cuts in stages – as seen with the National Insurance reduction in January and April – the government aims to provide incremental relief to taxpayers. The hope is that these tax cuts, combined with potential interest rate decreases by the Bank of England, could help alleviate the financial strain on households.\nHowever, the success of this strategy remains uncertain, as the volatile geopolitical climate continues to influence economic conditions and policy decisions.\nConclusion: A Call for Transparency and Accountability\nAs the dust settles on the recent budget announcement, many Britons are left grappling with the reality of fiscal drag and its hidden impact on their finances. The lack of transparency surrounding this phenomenon has raised concerns about the government’s commitment to supporting the ordinary citizen.\nMoving forward, there is a growing demand for greater accountability and clarity from policymakers and institutions like the OBR. Ordinary Britons deserve to understand the full implications of fiscal policies, including the often-overlooked effects of fiscal drag.\nUltimately, the success of any economic strategy will hinge on its ability to address the real concerns and challenges faced by the public. By prioritizing transparency, accountability, and a genuine understanding of the common folk’s struggles, the government can hope to regain trust and implement policies that truly benefit the nation as a whole.\nSummary\n• The recent budget left many ordinary Britons feeling underwhelmed and concerned about fiscal drag – a hidden tax dragging millions into higher tax brackets\n• Fiscal drag occurs when frozen tax thresholds push people into higher tax bands as wages rise, resulting in higher taxes despite modest income increases\n• It is impacting middle income professionals like teachers, police officers and nurses who should not be higher-rate taxpayers\n• The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forced Chancellor Hunt to scale back planned income tax cuts due to its forecasts\n• Critics argue the OBR has become too powerful, treating its projections as gospel and dictating policy\n• Geopolitical turmoil like the Ukraine war is adding volatility, making economic predictions difficult\n• There are hints the Chancellor could introduce tax cuts in an Autumn statement ahead of the next election\n• But success is uncertain given the volatile global situation\n• There are calls for greater transparency about fiscal drag’s impact and accountability from policymakers",

The report, published by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), has come under scrutiny after investigations revealed potential conflicts of interest in its governance structure.\nThe NATIONAL ENERGY SYSTEM OPERATOR LIMITED (NESO) Company number 11014226 report endorses plans requiring radical action to achieve clean power targets by 2030, including controversial measures that would fundamentally reshape Britain’s energy infrastructure. The proposed changes include a doubling of onshore wind farms, a tripling of offshore wind facilities and onshore solar sites, a five-fold increase in battery storage capacity, extended operational periods for nuclear plants, and the construction of new carbon capture facilities.\nThe scale of these proposed changes has raised concerns about both the financial implications and the impact on Britain’s countryside. The implementation would require significant reforms to planning laws and substantial taxpayer funding, alongside public acceptance of what is being portrayed as an urgent climate emergency requiring immediate action.\nEd Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, championed the report’s findings, describing it as “conclusive proof” that the government’s clean energy superpower mission represents the right choice for the country. He emphasised the benefits of replacing Britain’s dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets with domestically controlled clean power.\nHowever, investigations into NESO’s corporate structure have revealed that the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero—Miliband himself—is listed on Companies House as the person with “significant control” over the organisation. The company’s registered address is the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, raising questions about the true independence of the report’s findings.\nNESO’s website acknowledges that while the Secretary of State holds the shares and retains ultimate responsibility, with the government maintaining ownership, they claim there is no operational control from the government. The organisation states there exists “a clear separation between the government’s role in setting National policy and their influence as a majority shareholder.”\nCritics argue that this arrangement creates an inherent conflict of interest, suggesting that employees might be reluctant to produce findings that contradict the views of their ultimate authority. The report’s timing and its perfect alignment with ministerial objectives have further fuelled scepticism about its independence.\nDefenders of the report point to the credibility of the independent scientists involved, arguing that these professionals would not compromise their integrity. They also cite public support for climate action, with polling suggesting 69% of people express concern about climate change, and 61% support Net Zero initiatives.\nThe controversy speaks to broader debates about energy policy in the United Kingdom. Critics highlight that the UK already faces some of the highest energy costs in the developed world, with significant implications for economic development, business investment, and household budgets. They argue that the focus should be on reducing energy costs rather than pursuing ambitious environmental targets.\nThe practical implementation of the proposed measures has also drawn criticism. Technical experts have raised concerns about the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy solutions. For instance, wind energy requires backup capacity due to intermittent generation, effectively necessitating 200% capacity to ensure reliable power supply. Similarly, ground source heat pump installations for individual properties can cost upwards of £20,000, with recovery periods extending to 60-80 years, making them impractical for many homeowners.\nNuclear power has emerged as a potential alternative, with advocates arguing it represents a more efficient and cleaner form of energy generation. However, this too faces its own set of challenges and opposition from various stakeholders.\nAs the debate continues, calls grow for greater transparency regarding the relationship between government departments and their supposedly independent advisory bodies. The controversy highlights the delicate balance between pursuing environmental goals and maintaining public trust in the decision-making process that shapes Britain’s energy future.\nMiliband is lying to us\nHe owns the company that he is referencing to for data to support his personal war against our way of life, leading us towards bankruptcy, in order to keep his globalist paymasters happy.\nFor him to be using a report from a company that he owns, to justify his reckless plans is not only immoral, it is illegal. There is absolutely no way that this notion of the Great British Energy company can make sense, it will cost hundreds of billions of pounds, we are losing farmland at an alarming rate and this is before they begin to pass yet more laws, restricting our freedom in the name of their net-zero madness.\nWe must stand against this blatant deception!",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_europe-in-decline-an-overview/content_770.html": "Europe in Decline – An Overview\nThe Great Decline of Europe: A Comprehensive Analysis\nIntroduction\nIf you’re living in contemporary Europe and have even a passing interest in history and politics, you might have noticed a peculiar cognitive dissonance. On one hand, you hear the political elites and many Europeans themselves boasting about Europe’s global standing and civilizational superiority. On the other hand, the reality seems to tell a different story – one of diminishing importance, economic stagnation, and cultural subservience to the United States.\nIn this comprehensive blog post, we’ll delve deep into the various facets of Europe’s decline on the world stage. We’ll explore the economy, technology, cultural influence, geopolitical position, regulatory policies, and more. By the end, we’ll aim to understand the reasons behind Europe’s decline and ponder its possible trajectory in the future.\nEconomy and Technology\n**The Decline in GDP Share**: Let’s start with a quantifiable aspect – Europe’s share of the world GDP. In 1970, the EU and the UK together held over 35% of the world GDP, surpassing even the United States. However, this share has been consistently declining, falling to an estimated 16.6% by 2022. This decline becomes even more evident when compared to the United States, which has managed to maintain its share despite the rise of Asian economies.\n**GDP Per Capita**: When you shift the focus to GDP per capita, the picture remains grim. In 1980, the GDP per capita in Europe, especially in major economies like the UK, France, Germany, and Italy, was comparable to the United States. By 2022, these European economies lag behind the U.S. by significant margins. This indicates a widening wealth gap and a declining standard of living in Europe compared to its American counterpart.\n**Market Capitalization**: Examining the market capitalization of the world’s most valuable companies reveals another alarming trend. In 2022, only 15 out of the world’s top 100 companies were European, down from 16 in 2021. This contrasts with 46 European companies in 2007. Notably, the highest-ranked European company, LVMH, is in the luxury goods sector rather than tech or innovation.\n**Tech Industry**: Europe’s lag in the tech industry is evident in the dominance of American, Chinese, and Korean brands in consumer electronics and software. Europe struggled to keep pace when American and Asian smartphones took over the market. This is further exacerbated by Europe’s semiconductor chip shortage, impacting its automotive industry, which relies heavily on these chips.\n**Lack of Innovation**: Europe’s economy faces challenges due to a lack of innovation, heavy regulation, dependency on subsidies, and protectionist policies. The region struggles to compete with the dynamism seen in the U.S. and Asia. European businesses, especially older ones, often resist entrepreneurial spirit.\n**Debt and Dependence on Exports**: Europe’s high debt-to-GDP ratio, coupled with its heavy reliance on both exports and imports, makes it vulnerable to global economic shocks. This dependency on trade means Europe is exposed to shifts in global markets and geopolitics, such as the ongoing trend towards deglobalization.\nCulture and Influence\n**Cultural Dominance of America**: The cultural influence of America in Europe is overwhelming. Anglophone culture, particularly from the U.S. and the UK, dominates music, movies, and pop culture across European countries. The influence of American rap music, fashion, and lifestyle is particularly noteworthy.\n**Cinematography and Art**: While Europe still produces excellent films, they often lack the global reach of American or even Japanese anime productions. European cinema struggles to break free from the shadow of Hollywood, where budgets and audiences are larger.\n**Literature and Philosophy**: Europe’s literary and philosophical giants of the past seem hard to replicate today. Contemporary European literature and philosophy have not seen figures of the same stature as Kafka, Shakespeare, or Dostoevsky. Even influential figures like Camus and Sartre often have their greatest impact when working within the American cultural context.\n**Business Culture and Entrepreneurship**: European business culture tends to prioritize job security over entrepreneurial endeavors. The dream of many European graduates is a stable government job rather than creating innovative businesses. The lack of a culture that encourages risk-taking and entrepreneurship hinders Europe’s competitiveness on the global stage.\n**Hate and Obsession Towards America**: Many Europeans harbor bitterness and envy toward America while simultaneously embracing American culture, products, and politics. This peculiar love-hate relationship is often manifested in fierce debates about American issues that have limited relevance to the average European’s daily life.\n**Americanization of Europe**: The Americanization of European culture is often criticized, but it’s essential to recognize that this process is largely driven by Europeans themselves. American culture becomes appealing because it is seen as ascendant and trendy, which ironically reinforces the hate Europeans feel toward the United States.\nConclusion\nEurope’s decline is multi-faceted, touching upon economic stagnation, technological setbacks, cultural subservience, and an aversion to entrepreneurial risk. While Europe’s past achievements still contribute to its prosperity, it cannot rest on its laurels indefinitely. The continent must address these challenges, fostering innovation, encouraging entrepreneurship, and finding its place in a changing global landscape. Europe’s trajectory in the coming years will depend on its ability to adapt, innovate, and shape its own destiny, rather than succumb to decline.\n**Economy and Technology:**\n– Europe’s share of world GDP has significantly declined over the years, dropping from over 35% in 1970 to an estimated 16.6% in 2022, even without the UK.\n– GDP per capita in European countries has fallen behind the United States, with notable decreases in the UK, France, Germany, and Italy.\n– European firms struggle to compete globally, with a limited presence in the world’s most valuable companies and challenges in innovation and technology.\n**Cultural Influence:**\n– Despite its historical cultural significance, Europe’s cultural influence has waned in the face of global competition from American and Asian entertainment and media industries.\n**Geopolitical and Strategic Positioning:**\n– Europe faces challenges in asserting itself on the global stage, with shifting alliances, geopolitical tensions, and a less dominant role in international affairs.\n**Regulatory and Governing Policies:**\n– European regulatory policies, while emphasizing consumer protection and privacy, have sometimes hindered innovation and economic growth, contributing to the continent’s decline.\n**Future Trajectory:**\n– The future of Europe’s decline is uncertain, but addressing economic and technological challenges, adapting regulatory approaches, and fostering innovation will be essential to reversing the trend.\nIn summary, Europe’s decline is a multifaceted issue that demands careful consideration of economic, technological, cultural, geopolitical, and policy factors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for shaping the continent’s future and ensuring it remains a relevant and competitive player on the global stage.",

Visible policing stops crime before it starts. Allow PCSOs to become police officers before the role is phased out.\nCommon Sense Policing not ‘Woke’ Policing.\nScrap all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion roles and regulations to stop two-tier policing.

Reform the The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) so that the police complaints system works for the law abiding public.\nScrap or Reform Police and Crime Commissioners.\nPCCs do not have sufficient power to make a difference. Yet some employ 30 staff. That could be 30 more police officers on the beat. Either they get the power to make a real change or they should go.\nDe-Politicise the College of Policing.\nInstead, prioritise crime prevention, discipline, public service and high standards of strength and fitness.

If there is one positive to come from the lockdown, it is that their is always another way. Parents struggle to juggle school days/weeks/years with work and time to spend together as a family and take holidays. When they do wish to do so, during the summer, they are forced to pay extortionate rates, yet they have no option. In recent years, the growth of home/online schooling has been tremendous, and whilst I do not believe that children learning at home in isolation is ideal, there must surely be a real alternative, of hybrid learning, that will lend itself to modern life, whilst not punishing parents or children.\nWhen the national curriculum was introduced, it was to ensure that children throughout the country are learning the same subjects, to the same standard, over the same academic years, therefore, is it not time that this was also brought in to the digital age, with all lessons throughout primary and secondary education were available online, for free to all, and for that to paired with traditional learning to create flexible year-round learning for children?\nI am also of the opinion that too many school leavers are taking degrees that do little more than enslave them to a lifetime of debt, yet offer very little to them in the workplace. With the exception of vocational degrees, I strongly support workplace learning, along the lines of the QCF (Qualifications and Credit Framework) now called the RQF (Regulated Qualification Framework)\nThese are all issues that I would love to address and gather opinion from the people in Northampton North.",

The industrial action follows the company’s controversial proposals, including a potential 10% wage reduction and factory closures.\nScale of the Industrial Action\nAt Wolfsburg, the company’s primary manufacturing facility, a two-hour strike prevents the production of several hundred vehicles. The strikes are not limited to one location, with plants in Zwickau – Volkswagen’s dedicated EV manufacturing site – also experiencing significant disruption.\nMarket Challenges and Sales Decline\nThe strikes coincide with a dramatic slump in electric vehicle sales across Europe. In the first quarter of the year, EV sales dropped by 24%, with Volkswagen’s global sales declining by 3%. Consumers are increasingly returning to petrol-powered vehicles, challenging the industry’s electrification strategy.\nGlobal and Domestic Context\nThe crisis arrives during a period of significant economic uncertainty in Germany. Volkswagen’s struggles reflect broader challenges in the automotive sector, with manufacturers battling foreign competition, escalating production costs, and tepid consumer enthusiasm for electric vehicles.\nUnion Response and Negotiations\nThorsten Groeger, representing the IG Metall union, delivered a pointed message to management: “Anyone who ignores the workforce is playing with fire – and we know how to turn sparks into flames.”\nDaniela Cavallo, head of Volkswagen’s works council, suggested that major shareholders – including the Porsche and Piech families – might also need to make financial sacrifices. She emphasised that plant closures, mass layoffs, and wage cuts are unacceptable “red lines” for workers.\nProposed Cost-Saving Measures\nThe union previously proposed saving €1.5 billion by foregoing bonuses for 2025 and 2026, a suggestion management summarily dismissed as unrealistic.\nBroader Automotive Landscape\nVolkswagen is not alone in its struggles. Stellantis, which owns Vauxhall, recently announced plans to close its Luton van factory, putting 1,100 jobs at risk. The company’s chief executive resigned after a substantial 40% value decline.\nPolitical and Regulatory Environment\nThe UK’s approach to electric vehicle transition has also been fluctuating. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak previously pushed back the deadline for blocking new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035. The Labour Party, while initially committed to the 2030 target, now appears willing to compromise, potentially allowing hybrid vehicle sales until 2035.\nIndustry Perspective\nManufacturers have been lobbying against the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, arguing that consumer demand remains insufficient to support a rapid transition.\nWorker Sentiment\nUnion representatives have been vocally critical of management’s strategy. Sascha Dudzik condemned executives for “making workers pay” for strategic mistakes, including the diesel emissions scandal and falling behind innovative competitors.\nLucia Heim, a Volkswagen worker, poignantly summarised the workers’ frustration: “It’s a twisted world: in football, trainers quit if they’re not winning the game. At VW, it’s the other way around. Players are being punished.”\nLooking Ahead\nThe fourth round of negotiations, scheduled for 9 December, will be crucial. Union leaders have made it clear that without substantial compromises from management, the strikes could escalate to 24-hour or unlimited stoppages.\nA Volkswagen spokesperson stated that the company respects workers’ right to strike and is working to minimise disruption to customer supplies.\nAs the automotive industry navigates this complex transition, Volkswagen’s current crisis represents a microcosm of the broader challenges facing traditional manufacturers in the electric vehicle era.\nSummary\nIn short, the consequences of the determined push towards EVs, even though they are not really wanted are now beginning to be manifested in the destruction of European car manufacturing and the subsequent loss of jobs.\n1. Slow Consumer Adoption\n– EV sales in Europe dropped 24% in the first quarter\n– Consumers are returning to petrol-powered vehicles\n– Low consumer appetite is challenging manufacturers’ electrification strategies\n2. Manufacturing Challenges\n– High production costs for EVs\n– Increased competition from global manufacturers\n– Difficulty transitioning existing production lines\n3. Economic Pressure on Manufacturers\n– Volkswagen’s global sales dropped 3%\n– Potential factory closures (first time in VW’s history)\n– Wage cuts and workforce reductions being considered\n4. Regulatory Uncertainty\n– Shifting government deadlines for EV mandates\n– Manufacturers lobbying against aggressive zero-emission vehicle targets\n– Potential compromises on transition timelines (e.g., allowing hybrid sales until 2035)\n5. Strategic Realignment\n– Manufacturers reassessing EV investment strategies\n– Exploring more gradual transition approaches\n– Potential scaling back of ambitious electric vehicle plans\nThe overall implication is a complex, challenging transition with significant economic and industrial disruption for European car manufacturers.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-credit-score-industry-uncovering-the-scam/content_1007.html": "The Credit Score Industry: Uncovering the Scam\nIntroduction:\nGood afternoon everyone, and I hope you’re all doing well. Today, I want to address a topic that may shock and challenge your beliefs. What if I were to tell you that the entire credit score credit reference agency industry is a scam? Yes, you heard that right. In this blog post, we will dive deep into the workings of the credit score system, uncovering its collusion with banks to keep you trapped in debt. I firmly believe that owning a home should be a fundamental right, and the fact that it has become increasingly difficult in modern Britain is an indictment against our society and government.\nThe Scam: Collusion with Banks:\nLet’s start by examining how the credit score industry operates in collusion with banks to maintain control over our financial lives. The primary objective of this collusion is to keep individuals enslaved in debt and extract more money from them through higher interest rates. By discouraging people from paying off their debts and drawing down on their credit, the banking industry can ensure a continuous flow of profits.\nThe Illusion of Credit Scores:\nCredit scores, the foundation of this scam, should have no place in determining one’s eligibility for a mortgage or any form of funding. They are merely an excuse for banks to charge higher rates. There is no evidence to suggest that individuals intentionally default on their mortgages, knowing they will lose their homes. People only resort to such extreme measures when they have no other choice. It is unjust that the credit score system penalizes individuals who are responsible and have the means to repay their debts.\nThe Homeownership Crisis:\nIn modern-day Britain, the dream of owning a home has become more elusive than ever. This is a direct consequence of the flawed credit score system. While some individuals who bought their homes in the 80s are now mortgage-free, the current generation faces insurmountable challenges. Despite owing an average of a quarter of a million pounds or more, they are subjected to higher interest rates, making it increasingly difficult to achieve homeownership. This disparity is an indictment of our entire society, not just the credit industry.\nMandatory Capped Indemnity Insurance:\nTo address the perceived higher risk associated with lower deposits (below 10 or 15 percent), I propose the introduction of mandatory Capped Indemnity insurance. This insurance would protect lenders from potential losses if the worst were to happen. However, it is crucial to note that the frequency of mortgage repossessions is minuscule (1.5 per 1,000 mortgages). The losses incurred by this small number should not justify the exorbitant interest rates imposed on the larger population.\nThe Manipulation of Credit Scores:\nCredit scores, determined by algorithms, are prone to manipulation. The credit reference agencies, Equifax and Experian, encourage individuals to check their scores, offering credit cards and loans as a means to improve them. However, this only perpetuates the cycle of indebtedness. Paying off mortgages, loans, and credit cards promptly should be the norm, but the credit score system punishes those who do not remain perpetually in debt. Who decides these scores, and what criteria do they use? These questions remain largely unanswered.\nAnti-Competitive Practices:\nThe credit industry is the only sector where shopping around for the best deal is penalized. Applying for multiple loans or mortgages can lead to a significant drop in your credit score. This practice limits your ability to find the most favorable terms and keeps you captive to the lenders’ exploitative practices. Such anti-competitive behaviors should not be allowed, as they restrict individuals from exercising their right to seek the best financial options available.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the credit score credit reference agency industry operates as a scam, colluding with banks to maintain control over our finances and keep us enslaved in debt. The current system hinders the realization of homeownership as a fundamental right. It is time for a reform that eliminates credit scores as a determining factor for mortgage applications. Let’s create a financial system that empowers individuals, rather than enslaving them.\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this matter. Feel free to share your opinions, and let’s continue the conversation. Together, we can challenge the existing system and work towards a fairer and more equitable financial future.\nThank you for taking the time to read this blog post. Stay tuned for more thought-provoking content.",

Charities and many MPs are concerned about those still on a relatively small income who will miss out.\nThe vast majority of those eligible will only receive the payments if they have first claimed pension credit, a state pension top-up. It is estimated that 880,000 eligible pensioners have not claimed it.\nMs Graham told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the government needed to be “big enough and brave enough to do a U-turn” on plans to cut the allowance, calling for the introduction of a wealth tax to boost government finances instead.\n“Leadership is about making choices and knowing when you’ve done something wrong,” she said.\n“The point that we’re making here is that there are other taxes that we should be doing [instead].”\nMs Heathcote, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, raised the prospect of industrial action if there were government cuts.\nShe told the BBC: “I can see a situation where, if they continue along the line that they’re heading, not just winter fuel payments but with social security and benefits more generally, there will be a real backlash and that could take the form of industrial action… because lots of unions represent low paid workers.”\nMr Nowak, TUC general secretary, told BBC Breakfast he was “really concerned” by the impact of means testing winter fuel payments, adding that he expected the union to ask the government to “rethink” the decision.\n“I think it’s right the chancellor should rethink those plans and think about support put in place for pensioners,” he said.\n“I hope in the Budget the chancellor will set out support available for pensioners who aren’t on pension or tax credit, but who are not well off by any means, to make sure that they are not frightened to turn on the heating this winter.”\nSpeaking on Sunday with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg in his first major interview in Downing Street, Sir Keir said his new government was “going to have to be unpopular” as he defended his “tough” decision to cut winter fuel payments.\nHe accused previous governments of avoiding confronting the cost of the winter fuel payment.\n“When we talk about tough decisions, I’m talking about… the things the last government ran away from,” he said.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has maintained the policy is a necessary move to fill a £22bn “black hole” in the public finances left by the previous government – a claim the Conservatives have challenged.\nBut some Labour MPs have urged the government not to go forward with the policy.\nSome 11 Labour MPs were among the 27 who signed an early day motion – formal motion submitted for debate in the Commons – describing the plan as “a bureaucratic and unpopular means test” for pensioners.\nHome Office minister Dame Diana Johnson told BBC Breakfast she understood how the vote was a “really hard decision” for many MPs.\n“Obviously we do not want to see anyone struggling with energy bills, particularly pensioners… and that’s why it’s so important that the poorest pensioners are getting everything they’re entitled to to support them,” she said.\nThe Guardian has reported the potential rebellion could involve as many as 50 Labour MPs.\nOne Labour MP told the paper: “I’d expect the vast majority of anyone who does rebel to abstain, and remain inside the tent. Abstention is the new rebellion.”\nThe vote will pass due to the government’s sizeable majority. Those opposing the planned cut are expected to abstain rather than risk suspension by voting against the government.\nIn July, seven Labour MPs had the whip suspended for six months after voting against the government’s amendment to scrap the two-child benefit cap.\nSir Keir, however, has not commented on the potential punishment for rebels ahead of Tuesday’s vote.\nWhen asked by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg if he would suspend rebelling MPs from the parliamentary party, he said that was “a matter for the chief whip”.\nWhilst the decision only covers England and Wales, the Scottish government has also said it would end pensioners’ universal entitlement to the payment.\nThe benefit is separate from other support such as Cold Weather Payments, external, and the Warm Home Discount scheme.\nLabour’s claim of a £22bn black hole was also exposed, with a large portion of it being attributed to pay increases over and above the rate of inflation, which have been implemented by Labour themselves.\nThe lies are beginning to catch up with them!",

Criminal offenses under this Law do not constitute sexual offenses as defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 6 when they are consensual among children who have not reached the age of consensus (in Cyprus the age of 17 is set, while in other EU countries range from 14 to 16 years) and the age difference between the two children does not exceed three years and provided they have a similar degree of psychological and physical development or maturity.\n2. Sexual activities as defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 8 for the production, acquisition or possession of pornographic material involving children who have reached the age of sexual consent shall not constitute a criminal offense under this Law if the production and possession of such material is carried out with the consent of such children and for their own use only by the children concerned insofar as the acts do not include any abuse or even violence or exploitation or even extortion ting.\n3 . This article does not apply to the above cases if any of the children involved is under the age of 14 years.\n4. The courts of the Republic shall be entitled to prosecute offenses provided for in this Act, namely offenses of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children as well as child pornography if they are perpetrated by a citizen of the Republic in any foreign country irrespective of the fact that they constitute or not criminal offenses at the place where they were committed.\nSex between minors no more than 3 years apart decriminalised\nIt is worth mentioning that the relevant harmonized legislation introduced for the first time the blocking of websites with child pornography material following a prosecutor’s order. Additionally, a new criminal offense was defined as a “pornographic performance” so that criminal prosecution could also be brought in cases of transmission of such material by mobile or skype.\nSex between a 15 year old and a 12 year old would not be against the law!\nMarriage from the age of 17 years old\nDuring the elaboration of the above-mentioned law, the Legal Service considered necessary the amendment of the Marriage Law, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior, for the purpose of better transposition of article 8 of the relevant Directive, so as to prohibit marriage between a minor who is of the age of sexual consent an adult much larger than that. At the same time marriage will be permitted between persons who have reached the age of 17 or the age difference between the two does not exceed three years and have a similar degree of psychological and physical development or maturity.\nCOMMENT\nI am still trying to verify these reports, but it is looking very likely that they are correct. That being the case, they are conspicuous by their absence from the media, is that by accident or by design I wonder? Many of these perverse laws are passed in disguise or they are sneaked through when nobody is looking.\nI can honestly say, that I have always been against the Statutory Rape law for sex between a 16 year old boy and a 15 year old girl, they are in the same age bracket and someties what is little more than a few months difference in age, could destroy a young man’s future, and label him a sexual deviant, but……and this is a very consitional but, that DOES NOT mean that there should be an open invitation for minors to engage in sex. Phentermine 37.5 mg phentermineonline.org.There is already far too much sexualisation of the young, and whie it may seem perfectly normal to many, due to the fact that it is now so ubiquitous, that does not make it acceptable.\nThe requirements to deal with the act of sex are not just physical, they are emotional and there is a reason that society has an age of consent, firstly because the young need protecting and secondly, because sadly there are numerous older people who would not hesitate to violate them, given the opportunity.\nThe change in law in Cyprus has not just focused on a close margin of age, whilst maintaining clear boundaries, they have ammended the law to decriminalise sex between minors who are no more than 3 years apart in age…..WITHOUTH A LOWER THRESHOLD, that means a 15 yeard old can have sex with a 12 year old and it is not an offence! REALLY? Visit modafinil website buymodafinil.org\nThey have also ammended the laws on pornography, but whilst purporting to be making the law tougher, they have in fact legalised the performing of porngrahy, by anyone 14 and over provided that it is carried out with their consent!\nThey have also applied the law on age of consent for marriage, allowing those with no more than a 3 year gap to marry, even though the age of consent is officially 17 and marriage at 16 is currently only permissable with parental consent(now there’s a disparity)\nOnce again, they have left a gap for two minors to marry, why would they do that?\nThis must be one of the most distressing abuses of morality by the morons who are in positions of power that I have seen for a long time. Sex and children DO NOT go tother, never have, never will.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_labour-have-set-about-destroying-britain/content_55.html": "Labour have set about destroying Britain\nBritain’s Economic Transformation: A Critical Analysis of Recent Policy Shifts\nThe United Kingdom stands at a significant economic crossroads, with recent policy changes marking a substantial departure from previous fiscal approaches. The latest Budget presentation by Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves represents what many observers consider a fundamental shift in British economic policy-making.\nThe New Economic Framework\nThe Budget introduces sweeping changes to Britain’s fiscal landscape, particularly regarding taxation and public spending. At its core, the proposals signal a marked deviation from the economic model that has characterised British policy for roughly four decades—a model that positioned Britain as a bridge between American and European economic approaches.\nTaxation Changes\nThe proposed fiscal measures include several significant adjustments to the tax framework:\n– An expansion of inheritance tax provisions\n– Modifications to capital gains tax\n– Adjustments to employers’ national insurance contributions\n– Changes to various taxation thresholds\nThese alterations are projected to increase the tax burden from 36.4 per cent of GDP to 38.2 per cent by 2029-30, positioning Britain above the G7 average. This represents a notable shift from the 1990s, when the tax burden hovered around 28 per cent of GDP.\nPublic Spending Trajectory\nPublic expenditure is set to follow an upward trajectory:\n– Current spending levels of 44.9 per cent of GDP\n– An initial increase to 45.3 per cent\n– A projected settling at 44.5 per cent by 2029-30\nThis spending pattern marks a 4.9 percentage point increase from pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a significant expansion of state involvement in the economy.\nHistorical Context and Future Implications\nThe current policy direction represents a departure from both the Thatcherite approach of the 1980s and the Third Way policies of the Blair-Brown era. The new framework appears to embrace:\n– Enhanced state intervention in economic planning\n– Increased public sector investment\n– A more comprehensive approach to public services funding\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility’s analysis suggests various pressures on departmental budgets, though the precise nature of these constraints remains subject to debate amongst economic observers.\nEconomic Philosophy Shift\nThe new approach reflects a philosophical repositioning of economic policy, moving away from:\n– The free-market, free-trading entrepot model\n– The previous balance between private enterprise and state involvement\n– The historically lower taxation levels that characterised previous decades\nLooking Forward\nThe implications of these policy shifts are likely to be far-reaching. Key considerations include:\nShort-term Impact\n– Immediate effects on public sector spending\n– Near-term adjustments to taxation levels\n– Initial responses from various economic sectors\nMedium-term Considerations\n– Evolution of public service delivery\n– Adaptations in private sector behaviour\n– Changes in investment patterns\nLong-term Prospects\n– Structural changes to the economy\n– Shifts in Britain’s competitive position\n– Evolution of the public-private sector relationship\nComparative Context\nWhen viewed against international benchmarks, Britain’s new economic direction places it closer to European models of higher taxation and public spending than to the American approach. This represents a significant shift from the position Britain has occupied in recent decades.\nTechnical Analysis\nThe fiscal mathematics underlying these changes warrant careful examination:\n– Tax revenue projections and their underlying assumptions\n– Spending commitments and their sustainability\n– Impact on various economic sectors and demographics\n– Long-term implications for public finances\nEconomic Implications\nThe broader economic implications of these policy shifts deserve consideration across several dimensions:\nBusiness Impact\n– Effects on small and medium enterprises\n– Implications for international investment\n– Changes to business planning horizons\nIndividual Impact\n– Changes to personal taxation\n– Effects on savings and investment\n– Implications for retirement planning\nSectoral Impact\n– Public sector adjustments\n– Private sector responses\n– Third sector considerations\nConcluding Observations\nThese policy changes represent a significant reorientation of British economic policy. While their full implications will only become clear over time, they mark a notable departure from previous approaches to managing the economy.\nThe success or failure of these measures will likely be determined by:\n– Their impact on economic growth\n– Effects on public service delivery\n– International competitiveness\n– Social outcomes\n– Fiscal sustainability\nAs Britain navigates this new economic direction, careful monitoring of outcomes and willingness to adjust policies as needed will be crucial for ensuring positive economic and social results.\nSummary\nHere’s a concise bullet-point summary of the key points:\n• Major Policy Shift\n– UK’s economic policy is undergoing significant transformation\n– Marks departure from 40-year economic model that balanced US and European approaches\n– New direction favours increased state intervention\n• Key Tax Changes\n– Tax burden to rise from 36.4% to 38.2% of GDP by 2029-30\n– Will exceed G7 average\n– Includes changes to:\n* Inheritance tax\n* Capital gains tax\n* National insurance contributions\n* Various tax thresholds\n• Public Spending\n– Set to increase from 44.9% to 45.3% of GDP\n– Projects to settle at 44.5% by 2029-30\n– 4.9 percentage points higher than pre-pandemic levels\n• Historical Context\n– Departs from Thatcherite free-market approach\n– Differs from Blair-Brown era policies\n– Tax burden in 1990s was around 28% (currently much higher)\n• Economic Philosophy\n– Moves away from free-market, free-trading model\n– Embraces greater state intervention\n– Focuses on public sector investment\n– Emphasises expanded public services\n• Main Implications\n– Will affect business planning and investment\n– Changes personal taxation landscape\n– Impacts public service delivery\n– Influences UK’s international competitiveness\n• Future Considerations\n– Success depends on:\n* Economic growth outcomes\n* Public service effectiveness\n* International competitiveness\n* Fiscal sustainability\n– Will require ongoing monitoring and potential adjustments",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_china-caves-in-on-tariffs/content_37.html": "China Caves in on Tariffs\nCrushing turn in the CCP’s Economic Strategy\nBeijing Quietly Reverses Course on Trade War as Economic Pressures Mount\nRecent developments suggest China is backtracking in the ongoing trade dispute with the United States, as mounting evidence indicates the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recognises its economy’s vulnerability to American tariffs. Despite maintaining aggressive rhetoric publicly, Beijing has begun quietly exempting numerous American products from retaliatory tariffs—a tacit acknowledgement that China remains dependent on US goods that cannot be sourced elsewhere.\nEconomic analysts point to China’s apparent retreat as confirmation that Xi Jinping’s administration has miscalculated its position in the global economy. The Chinese leader has spent years assuring citizens that China had surpassed the United States economically, leaving his government politically unable to openly acknowledge economic difficulties or negotiate from a position of weakness.\nChina’s Economic Reality Check\nThe shift in Chinese policy comes amidst troubling economic indicators. A recent video circulating on social media showed a shuttered clothing factory, with the uploader claiming “China’s economy is crashing so fast that the CCP is now banning companies from leaving China.” This points to a broader contraction in manufacturing across various sectors.\nParticularly telling is China’s approach to American technology firms. When Apple announced plans to shift iPhone production to India, Chinese authorities reportedly began obstructing the transfer of necessary equipment. According to industry sources, Chinese officials have delayed approvals for exporting iPhone manufacturing equipment from two weeks to as long as four months, with some applications being rejected without explanation.\nThis effort to prevent manufacturing exodus highlights Beijing’s growing concerns about its economic outlook. Yet such measures may prove counterproductive, potentially accelerating the diversification of supply chains away from China in the long term.\nTariff Exemptions Reveal Dependencies\nPerhaps most revealing is China’s quiet rolling back of tariffs on hundreds of American products—a move not widely publicised within China. Reuters reports that China has reduced its 125% retaliatory tariffs on US-made microchips needed for electronic devices and is considering exemptions for more than 130 categories of American products.\nThese exemptions would cover approximately $46 billion in imports, representing roughly 28% of China’s total imports from the United States based on 2024 figures. The list notably includes turbo jets, processors, and aircraft materials—critical components for China’s aviation sector, which relies heavily on Boeing aircraft maintenance despite public statements to the contrary.\nThis retreat on aviation-related tariffs is particularly notable given Xi Jinping’s recent diplomatic tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia aboard his Boeing aircraft, during which Chinese state media announced that Chinese airlines would cease purchasing Boeing planes. The practical reality of aviation safety and maintenance requirements appears to have forced a significant policy adjustment.\nDeflationary Spiral Contradicts Official Growth Claims\nEconomic indicators paint a concerning picture of China’s true economic state. The country has entered what appears to be a deflationary spiral, with both the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index showing negative figures—the CPI down for two consecutive months and the PPI falling for an astonishing 30 straight months.\nThese figures contradict the 5.4% economic growth China reported for the first quarter of 2025. Similarly, tax receipts for Q1 decreased by 3.5%, raising further questions about the accuracy of official growth statistics.\nManufacturing Crisis and Domestic Market Saturation\nChina’s export-oriented manufacturing model faces unprecedented challenges as American tariffs take effect. Factories previously dedicated to producing goods for the US market have pivoted toward domestic consumers, creating intense competition for businesses that traditionally served the Chinese market.\nThis has triggered a cascade of factory closures and redundancies as smaller manufacturers cannot compete with larger operations now selling products below profitable prices to liquidate inventories. The resulting price war has intensified deflationary pressures, creating a vicious economic cycle.\nFurther complicating matters, unsold products originally destined for export markets are being offloaded domestically at steep discounts, undercutting local producers who must maintain profitable pricing structures. This domestic market saturation represents an unintended consequence of the trade war that appears to be accelerating China’s economic difficulties.\nDiplomatic Double Standards on Free Trade\nThe economic pressures have led to a rather contradictory diplomatic stance. Chinese ambassadors recently convened a United Nations meeting to complain that US tariffs violate free trade principles, whilst simultaneously imposing restrictions preventing companies from relocating production outside China.\nThis inconsistency has not gone unnoticed by other nations. South Korea recently imposed temporary anti-dumping duties of 27.9% to 38% on Chinese steel plates, measures that will remain in effect for four months until August 2025. South Korean authorities have also begun seizing Chinese products that arrive in the country solely to be relabelled as Korean-made for export to the United States.\nIn one notable enforcement action, Korean customs officials seized a warehouse in Busan containing approximately 1.2 million Chinese-manufactured mattresses worth roughly 74 billion won. The operation, reportedly run by Chinese businesspeople, involved forging certificates of origin to disguise the products as Korean-made to circumvent US anti-dumping tariffs.\nGlobal Supply Chain Realignment\nAs the trade tensions continue, global manufacturing patterns are beginning to shift. Foxconn has commenced assembly of iPhone 16e handsets in Brazil, where the 10% tariff rate from the US remains among the lowest globally. Similarly, India has emerged as a key alternative manufacturing destination, signing a memorandum of understanding with the United States during a recent visit by Vice President Vance.\nThis realignment creates both challenges and opportunities. Whilst manufacturers seek to minimise production costs by concentrating operations in a single location, current geopolitical tensions are encouraging diversification across multiple countries to mitigate future risks.\nEconomic strategists suggest the optimal approach would involve distributing manufacturing across various nations including Vietnam, Cambodia, India, and countries in Latin America, rather than simply shifting dependencies from China to another single nation. Some have proposed implementing graduated tariff structures that would only activate when imports from any single country exceed predetermined thresholds, effectively incentivising supply chain diversification.\nNational Security Implications\nThe current trade dispute underscores significant national security concerns regarding supply chain dependencies. As one commentator noted, in a potential conflict scenario, China’s first move might not be military but rather economic leverage over American corporations with significant Chinese manufacturing operations.\nThis vulnerability represents a profound strategic concern for US policymakers. Warren Buffett, arguably the world’s most successful investor, has been warning about the implications of America’s trade deficit since at least 2003. He has consistently argued that persistent trade imbalances effectively transfer ownership claims on domestic assets to foreign entities.\nBuffett’s perspective emphasises that whilst free trade generally benefits all participants, structural imbalances can eventually compromise economic sovereignty: “We could all quit working and we could hand little pieces of paper to the rest of the world. They could keep sending us food, they could send us autos, they could send us all kinds of things, but eventually they have claims on all our wealth.”\nTowards Economic Rebalancing\nThe current administration appears focused on recalibrating America’s trade relationships globally, with the Treasury Secretary recently noting that more than 100 countries have approached the United States regarding trade negotiations. This suggests a broader realignment of global trade patterns may be underway, rather than simply an isolated dispute with China.\nThe goal, according to policy statements, is not to bring all manufacturing back to American shores, but rather to ensure high-value manufacturing returns to the United States whilst lower-value production is distributed across allied nations. This approach aims to create high-income jobs domestically whilst simultaneously reducing strategic vulnerabilities associated with over-concentration of supply chains.\nAs this economic recalibration continues, Chinese authorities face difficult choices. Their current economic model, heavily dependent on manufacturing exports, appears increasingly unsustainable in the face of coordinated tariff policies from major trading partners. The coming months will likely determine whether Beijing can adapt to these changing circumstances or faces prolonged economic challenges as global supply chains evolve away from their previous China-centric structure.\nI’ve transformed the transcript into a comprehensive article using UK English spelling and style.

This move comes with a discounted membership fee, representing an agreement reached after extensive negotiations. Initially, the UK agreed to a £15 billion membership fee as part of the post-Brexit trade and cooperation deal. However, tensions surrounding the Northern Ireland protocol led to the European Commission’s rejection of this deal. Nevertheless, Brussels has now agreed not to charge Britain for the years it was locked out of the scheme during the negotiations.\nMany believe that this return to Horizon could be a boon for British scientists, as they gain access to a substantial £18 billion pool for grant applications. But what does this agreement entail, and what are the underlying details? In this blog post, we’ll explore the UK’s reentry into the Horizon program and dissect the implications.\nThe Horizon Europe Program:\nHorizon Europe is an ambitious scientific collaboration program across Europe, aimed at fostering research and innovation for the benefit of all participating nations. On the surface, it appears to be a mutually beneficial endeavor. However, delving into the fine print reveals a different story.\nThe Fine Print:\nHorizon Europe’s fundamental aim, as stated prominently on its website, is the promotion of EU policies that align with the European Union’s interests. In essence, the EU Commission determines what research projects align with their agenda and the EU’s priorities. This means that the UK, in rejoining Horizon, will contribute £2.6 billion annually from taxpayers’ money to the program. Subsequently, the EU will decide which British scientific projects comply with its interests and may return the funds accordingly. In essence, the UK is funding research that primarily serves EU interests.\nThe European Defence Fund:\nNotably, two weeks before signing the trade and cooperation agreement, the European Defense Fund was integrated into Horizon Europe. This fund supports military research aimed at advancing EU military capabilities and interoperability—a direct challenge to NATO. Therefore, the UK’s involvement in Horizon Europe indirectly supports the creation of an EU army, which goes against the principles of Brexit.\nThe Lack of an Exit Strategy:\nOne significant concern arises from the lack of an exit strategy. Unlike a traditional membership agreement where a nation can choose to leave, the UK’s participation in Horizon Europe binds it to the program. The only way the UK can exit is if the EU decides to expel it, a scenario that seems highly unlikely as the EU benefits from British funding.\nThe Bigger Picture:\nThis situation raises questions about the direction the UK is heading. Despite the promises of regaining sovereignty post-Brexit, it appears that the country is being drawn back into the EU’s orbit. The UK is no longer making decisions solely in its national interest but is instead tethered to policies that may not align with its own priorities.\nConclusion:\nIn summary, the UK’s decision to rejoin the EU scientific research program, Horizon, comes with both potential benefits and significant concerns. While it may offer British scientists access to substantial funding, there are underlying complexities that warrant close examination.\nThe UK’s return to the Horizon Europe program with a discounted membership fee may seem like a positive development for British scientists. However, the fine print reveals a different story—one where the UK is financially supporting research primarily aligned with EU interests. Moreover, the lack of an exit strategy raises concerns about the UK’s commitment to its post-Brexit course. As the country navigates these intricate agreements, it’s essential for citizens and policymakers to stay informed and scrutinize the details to ensure they align with the nation’s interests and the principles of Brexit.\nKey Takeaways:\n– The UK agreed to a discounted membership fee for Horizon as part of the post-Brexit trade deal.\n– Tensions around the Northern Ireland protocol led to the rejection of the initial agreement, but Britain won’t be charged for the years it was excluded.\n– Horizon Europe, on the surface, appears as a collaborative scientific program, but its primary aim is to promote EU policies.\n– The EU Commission determines which British research projects align with its interests, raising questions about the UK’s control over its scientific priorities.\n– Integration of the European Defense Fund into Horizon Europe indirectly supports the development of an EU army, contrary to Brexit principles.\n– There is no clear exit strategy for the UK, making it challenging to disengage from the program if necessary.\n– The UK’s participation in Horizon Europe raises concerns about the nation’s sovereignty post-Brexit and its alignment with EU policies.\nAs the UK continues its involvement in Horizon Europe, it is crucial for both citizens and policymakers to remain vigilant and scrutinize the details to ensure they serve the best interests of the UK and respect the principles of Brexit.\nIn short, we have been committed to paying the EU £2.6bn per year and we have no way out, well done Mr Sunak!",

The Ottoman Empire had just been at war with Russia and were very much in danger of losing control of their capital Constantinople. The British intervened in the crisis on the side of the Ottoman Turks by sending a fleet to intimidate the Russians. The Ottoman Sultan was so thankful for the British intervention that he granted the control of the island of Cyprus to the British under the Cyprus Convention.\nThe timing was quite auspicious for the British, the Suez Canal had opened less than a decade before and so the sea-borne traffic in the Eastern Mediterranean was rising substantially. Much of this traffic was British en route to or from India. Some 4 years later, the British would use the island as a major base of operations for the invasion and occupation of Egypt. This would confirm Britain’s growing dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean and Cyprus’ role would rise commensurate with that influence.\nThe first Briton who was placed in charge of the administration was given the title of “High Commissioner” and was Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley (1833–1913). The British faced a major political problem on the island. The indigenous Cypriots believed it their natural right to unite the island with Greece following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The British authorities carried out the first census in 1881, the total population of Cyprus was 186,173, of whom 137,631 (73.9%) were Greeks, 45,438 (24.4%) were Turks and 3,084 (1.7%) were minorities of Maronites, Latins and Armenians.[2] Bishop of Kitium Kyprianos addressed Sir Garnet Joseph Wolseley upon his arrival in Larnaca in a speech on the 22nd of July 1878 saying “We (Greeks) accept the change of the government, because we believe that Great Britain will eventually help Cyprus, just like with the Ionian islands, unite Cyprus with mother Greece”.\nBy 1906 the major harbour at Famagusta had been completed for this purpose. The British were supposed to be running Cyprus on behalf of the Ottomans, but this informal agreement would be boldly ended at the outbreak of World War One, when the Turks and British found themselves on opposing sides. Indeed many of the Greek Cypriots on the island, as British subjects, joined the British Army and fought against the Ottomans. The island itself was a useful base of operations against the Turks. It became a particularly useful staging area for the Dardanelles campaign.\nWhile the Cypriots at first welcomed British rule hoping that they would gradually achieve prosperity, democracy and national liberation, they became disillusioned. The British imposed heavy taxes to cover the compensation which they were paying to the Sultan for having conceded Cyprus to them. Moreover, the people were not given the right to participate in the administration of the island, since all powers were reserved to the High Commissioner and to London.\nBritish Cyprus (1914–60)\nHouse in Nicosia CBD built in British colonisation era\nCyprus was part of the British Empire from 1914 under military occupation from 1914–1925 and a Crown colony from 1925–1960. However, Cyprus’ status as a protectorate of the British Empire ended in 1914 when the Ottoman Empire declared war against the Triple Entente powers, which included Great Britain. Cyprus was then annexed by the British Empire on 5 November 1914. During the course of the First World War Britain offered to cede Cyprus to Greece if they would fulfil treaty obligations to attack Bulgaria, but Greece declined.\nBritain proclaimed Cyprus the Crown colony of British Cyprus in 1925, under an undemocratic constitution. It kept the original Legislative Council that had been formulated in 1882. The Greek majority found that it could not break the constitutional deadlock as the Turkish minority would side with the British appointed representatives. Riots broke out in 1931 over the imposition of certain taxes. This would result in the death of six civilians and the burning down of the British Government house in Nicosia. The constitution would be suspended as a result and direct rule imposed.\nInternational recognition of the new Republic of Turkey resulted from the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 in which the new Turkish government formally recognised Britain’s sovereignty over Cyprus (article 20). The administration was reformed in the latter 1920s, and some members of the Legislative Council (established 1926) were elected by the Cypriots, but their participation was very marginal. The Legislative Council was abolished in 1931.\nGreek Cypriots believed the circumstances were right to demand union of the island with Greece (enosis), as many of the Aegean and Ionian islands had done following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. In the years that followed, Greek Cypriots’ demands for enosis (union with Greece), which the British opposed, developed rapidly during the 1930s, leading to the destruction of the Government House in Nicosia, which was burnt down in the 1931 Cyprus Revolt.\nPalmerokratia\nThe period between October 1931 and October 1940 proved to be a very difficult one for the Cypriots. The Governor at the time, Sir Richmond Palmer, took a number of suppressive measures including limitations on the administration and functioning of Greek schools, and prohibition of trade unions and associations of any kind and form. This regime became known as “Palmerokratia”, named after the Governor. Its aim was to prevent local public interest in politics. There were strong protests against the regime but the suppressive measures were not lifted until the beginning of the Second World War, during which more than thirty thousand Cypriots joined the British armed forces. In World War Two, the Greek population would rally whole heartedly behind the British – especially after the Italian invasion of mainland Greece and the subsequent arrival of German forces there. Some 30,000 islanders volunteered to fight for the British. The island itself was actually spared much of the fighting apart from air raids. It would remain in British possession and would prove an invaluable staging and refuelling post and would ensure that the Eastern end of the Mediterranean remain reasonably secure for the British.\nEndeavours by the British to introduce constitutional government designed to develop some participation without leading to enosis failed, despite determined efforts to achieve some semblance of liberal and democratic government, notably by the post-war Labour government in Britain.\nProposed union with Greece\nIn 1948, King Paul of Greece declared that Cyprus desired union with Greece. In 1950 the Orthodox Church of Cyprus presented a referendum according to which around 97% of the Greek Cypriot population wanted the union. The United Nations accepted the Greek petition and enosis became an international issue. In 1952 both Greece and Turkey became members of NATO. After the war, a delegation from Cyprus submitted a demand for enosis to London. The demand was rejected but the British proposed a more liberal constitution and a 10-year programme of social and economic development.\nLed by Archbishop Makarios, the Greek Cypriot demand for enosis emerged with new force in the 1950s, when Greece began to accord it support on the international scene. This attempt to win world support alerted Turkey and alarmed the Turkish Cypriots.\nThe British withdrawal from Egypt led to Cyprus becoming the new location for their Middle East Headquarters.\nThe island took on a new strategic importance for the British after Egypt became independent in 1952. Cyprus’ strategic situation near to an increasingly volatile Middle East and not far from the Suez Canal shipping lanes. Even after the 1956 Suez debacle (much of which was coordinated from Cyprus), it still provided a useful monitoring station and also played a role in the developing Cold War and supporting NATO allies like Turkey and Greece despite their difficulties with one another. The Soviet Union’s currying of favour with various Middle Eastern regimes in the 1950s and 1960s combined with its Black Sea Fleet in the region meant that Cyprus was well placed to provide surveillance, intelligence and military responsiveness in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nRising Greek nationalism in the post war period saw political tensions rise as the Greek Cypriots on the island wanted to unite with Greece, whilst the Turkish Cypriots were equally keen to join with Turkey. Riots became increasingly violent as the British themselves resisted claims from both sides in order to keep their important military bases there and to try and keep one group being subjugated by the other. From 1955, the Greek Cypriot EOKA started a campaign of violence to speed up the process for some form of independence. The British responded in November of that year by declaring a State of Emergency.\nCyprus Emergency\nWhen international pressure did not suffice to make Britain respond as required, violence escalated with a campaign against the colonial power organised by EOKA (Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston). Its leader, Colonel George Grivas, created and directed an effective campaign beginning in 1955. The first bombs were set off on April 1, followed by leaflets. Attacks on police stations started on June 19. The British Governor proclaimed a State of Emergency on 26 November 1955.\nFor the next four years EOKA attacked British or British-connected targets and those Cypriots it accused of collaboration. Archbishop Makarios and other Cypriot clergy and political leaders were forced into exile in the Seychelles. 371 British servicemen died fighting the independence movement during the Cyprus Emergency, including over 20 in the Operation Lucky Alphonse.\nMuch of the strategic rationale for maintaining Cyprus would disappear after the Suez Canal debacle in 1956 which saw Britain climb down from their invasion of the canal zone. In many ways this event marked the beginning of the end of the British Empire in Africa and the Middle East. Consequently nationalists on the island of Cyprus took heart and increased their demands for independence. Although the intractable demands of the two major constituencies made these negotiations particularly difficult\nEasily infiltrated by Greek Cypriot sympathisers working for them in various ancillary tasks, the British security forces had to exert great efforts under Field Marshal Sir John Harding to suppress the independence movement. They were much more successful than is often recognised, though the attacks on British personnel never quite ceased. Makarios was exiled, suspected of involvement in the EOKA campaign, but was released when EOKA, exhausted but still determined to fight, agreed to cease hostilities on the Archbishop’s release and return.\nFrom mid-1956 onwards there were constant discussions in NATO, but all efforts to create an independent Cyprus which would be a member of the Commonwealth of Nations were futile.\nTurkish Cypriots\nThe Turkish Cypriot response to the challenges posed by the prospect of decolonization and the breakdown of the colonial order was to adopt the call for partition (taksim). Taksim became the slogan which was used by the increasingly militant Turkish Cypriots in an attempt to mirror the Greek cry of ‘enosis’. In 1957 Küçük declared during a visit to Ankara that Turkey would claim the northern half of the island.\nIn April 1957, in the new conditions made obvious by the Suez Crisis debacle, the British government accepted that bases on Cyprus were an acceptable alternative to Cyprus as a base. This produced a much more relaxed British attitude to the problem. It was now to be solved in conjunction with Greece and Turkey, the latter thoroughly alerted to the dangers of enosis for the Turkish Cypriot population.\nViolence was renewed in Cyprus by EOKA, but it increasingly drew in the Turkish community when a new plan for unitary self-government, of British Governor Sir Hugh Foot, incited Turkish Cypriot riots and produced a hostile response from the Turkish government. Violence between the two communities developed into a new and deadly feature of the situation.\nIn 1957 the U.N. decided that the issue should be resolved according to its Statutory Map. The exiles returned, and both sides began a series of violent acts against each other. In the few years that existed before the Zürich and London Agreements (1959 /1960) Greece tried again to win international recognition and support for the cause of enosis at the U.N. against a background of renewed and continuing EOKA violence directed against the British. It was to no avail. Eventually Greece had to recognise that Turkey was now a vitally interested party in the dispute.\nGrivas and EOKA also had to accept the changed situation. Makarios could see no way of excluding Turkey from participating in any solutions. It was widely believed by the Greek-Cypriots that Britain had promoted the Turkish-Cypriot case, thus preventing the achievement of enosis.\nIn 1958 the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan prepared new proposals for Cyprus, but his plan which was a form of partition, was rejected by Archbishop Makarios. The Archbishop declared that he would only accept a proposal which guaranteed independence, excluding both Enosis and partition.\nCypriot constitution\nOn February 19, 1959 the Zürich agreement attempted to end the conflict. Without the presence of either the Greek or the Turkish sides, the UK outlined a Cypriot constitution, which was eventually accepted by both sides. Both Greece and Turkey along with Britain were appointed as guarantors of the island’s integrity.\nSome of the major points of the Zurich agreement are:\n- Cyprus is to become an independent state.\n- Both taksim and enosis are to be prohibited.\n- Greek and Turkish military forces, at a ratio of approximately 3:2, are to be present at all time in Cyprus. Both forces are to answer to all three foreign ministers: of Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.\n- The President is to be a Greek Cypriot, elected by the Greek Cypriot population, and the Vice President a Turkish Cypriot, elected by the Turkish Cypriot population.\n- The Cabinet is to include seven Greek Cypriots, chosen by the President, and three Turkish Cypriots, chosen by the Vice President.\n- Decisions will need an absolute majority but both the President and the Vice President have the right of veto.\n- The United Kingdom is to remain a guarantor and keep both of its military bases.\nIndependence\nOn August 16, 1960 Cyprus gained its independence from the United Kingdom, after the long anti-British campaign by the Greek Cypriot EOKA (National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters), a guerrilla group which desired political union with Greece, or enosis. Archbishop Makarios III, a charismatic religious and political leader, was elected the first president of independent Cyprus. In 1961 it became the 99th member of the United Nations.\nThe Zurich agreement, however, did not succeed in establishing cooperation between the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot populations. The Greek Cypriots argued that the complex mechanisms introduced to protect Turkish Cypriot interests were obstacles to efficient government and as such developed the Akritas Plan aimed at forcing all Turkish Cypriot parliamentarians from government so as not to disrupt Greek Cypriot plans of enosis. Both sides continued the violence. Turkey threatened to intervene on the island.\nSummary\nWhen the British took control of Cyprus in 1878, they had to pay the Ottomans an annual levy, for which they taxed the Cypriots excessively, causing widespread poverty and resentment. It is understandable that when a population is exploited to this degree, that they will not only be prepared to take drastic actions, (desperate people, take desperate measures) but also, that very desperation makes them vulnerable to political exploitation. In this brief historical account, we see one word appear more than any other ENOSIS!\nIn 1828, modern Greece’s first president Ioannis Kapodistrias called for union of Cyprus with Greece, and numerous minor uprisings took place, For the main part, this was kept under wraps until it resurfaced in 1915, when the British offered Cyprus to Greece, in return for them joining the allies in war effort, but the offer was withdrawn before Greece joined, was this the moment that Pandora’s box was opened?\nOne thing is for certain, the Greek Orthodox Church, which has a dream of a new Byzantine empire has always encouraged the desire for Enosis, for a Greek orthodox empire with the church at its centre. Let us not forget that the Byzantine empire eroded and almost self-destructed as a result of its own treachery. In the rare instance that you will run in to a Greek Orthodox priest who will actually admit the reality, they will confirm this. However, before we condemn the Cypriot public for their blind faith in the church and enosis, we must take in to account the literacy rates at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century, which were around 30%. A situation that was exploited not only by the British, but also by the church, which had encouraged Cypriots to out thousands of acres of land in the name of the church, to avoid taxation by the Ottomans, but then the church actually kept it and to this day, they are profiting from it with the development of exclusive golf resorts.\nThis was a period when Cypriots were raised with one mindset, union with Greece. following the October riots of 1931, the desire to rid Cyprus of the British and pursue union with Greece began to increase rapidly, until the formation of EOKA when the struggle for independence began.\nThe words “struggle for independence” seem so ironic as for many, it was not a struggle for independence, it was a struggle to take sovereignty away from the British and hand it to Greece. This campaign for freedom was one of the first time in history that the Cypriot people took on a military giant and forced them to desperately seek a manner in which to concede without losing face. Sadly the British were not going to take this lightly.\nWhen filed Marshal Harding arrived in October 1955, the situation in Cyprus was about to take a sinister turn. He not only set about enforcing draconian measures, he also set about implementing a policy of divide and conquer. He instigated a division between the communities that remains to this day. He instigated the assassination of innocent people on each side, then blaming the other, to cause social unrest to break the people.\nAt the same time, Girogios Grivas began to diver the campaign against Turkish Cypriots, playing right in to the hands of the British, who were happy to fan the flames. One famous EOKA fighter was Grigoris Afksentiou, who fought many brave battles, but eventually went in to hiding in the mountains near Machairas Monastery. On the 3rd March 1955, Field Marshal Harding discovered his whereabouts thanks to an informer and the area was surrounded. Grigoris Afksentiou refused to surrender, so Harding ordered the entire valley be set alight, burning Grigoris Afksentiou alive.\nThis was not warfare, this was a vendetta, conducted by Harding and it was murder!\nWhilst Grigoris Afksentiou was also a faithful supporter of enosis, which I agree with, I do take the cultural in-doctrine of the era in to account, but that aside, one thing is for certain, the actions of Field Marshall Harding on that day were not those of a military man, this was the highest ranking officer in the British army, the army of an empire, suppressing ordinary people, fighting for their liberty, albeit that it was hijacked by enosis and for him to have ordered a man to be burned alive leaves him, his family and the British with a legacy of SHAME!\nEnosis has and still is the nemesis of Cyprus, it is sadly ironic that this beautiful island has been torn apart and divided by a word that means ‘unity’\nIt is with this in mind that the need, indeed the obligation to cast off the demons of the past and save our island from continuing to be exploited by division, because whatever these people who gave their lives may have believed, they sacrificed their lives for Cyprus, right, wrong, misguided or even reckless, we are obliged to them and if we are complacent and allow Cyprus to disintegrate, that would be the greatest mark of disrespect not only for our island, but also to the many who have given their lives, decade after decade, century upon century, since time began.\nI was born and raised in the UK, I do love the UK, but where this matter is concerned, I would like to see an official apology for the despicable way that Cyprus was treated by the British, the suffering they inflicted on the Cypriot people and the social divisions that they instigated that divide us to this day.",

With soaring housing instability and a rising number of families teetering on the brink, the UK’s silent epidemic is beginning to cast a long, dark shadow. This blog post delves into the intricate web of factors contributing to homelessness in the UK, from housing policies to the financial strain on renters and the consequences it brings. Let’s explore this pressing issue that challenges the nation’s prosperity.\nThe Growing Shadow of Homelessness\nThe United Kingdom, with its remarkable GDP and high employment rate, seems to have most things right, except one: housing its citizens rapidly and alarmingly. The number of households owed help from local authorities to address homelessness has surged, and currently, homelessness in England is at its highest since 2018. This is a grim reality that we cannot afford to ignore.\nThe Housing Nightmare\nEven when families secure rental homes, they often face subpar living conditions. Shockingly, 40% of rented homes fail to meet basic living standards, leaving residents dealing with pest infestations, dampness, and safety hazards. For over 400,000 employed households in privately rented properties, severe problems are a daily reality, including health-threatening dampness and mold, hazardous electrical installations, and dangerous chemicals like carbon monoxide, lead, and asbestos.\nPrivate Rentals: A Troubling Trend\nThe issue of private rentals in the UK has reached alarming levels, with landlords sometimes downplaying or concealing existing defects to attract tenants. A survey revealed that one in three renters discovered undisclosed issues after moving in, and one in ten feared eviction if they voiced their concerns. This lack of transparency contributes to the growing housing instability in the country.\nThe Historical Roots\nThe surge in homelessness can be traced back to housing policies in the 1980s when the right to buy policy was introduced, allowing tenants to purchase their council homes at reduced prices. While this policy shifted housing capital to the working class, it also led to a decline in available council homes as councils were prohibited from building new ones. Many who had bought council houses sold them to private landlords, fundamentally altering the demographics of affordable housing in the UK.\nThe Stereotype Trap\nMedia portrayals, such as Channel 4’s documentary series “Benefit Street,” have fueled stereotypes about social housing and benefit claimants, perpetuating myths about jobless generations. However, research has shown that the majority of families in these neighborhoods aspire to work and avoid unemployment.\nA Changing Housing Landscape\nThe housing landscape in the UK has undergone a significant shift over the years, with a growing number of working households opting for private rentals. This has cascading effects on various aspects of society, including poverty, education, employment, and community cohesion.\nFinancial Strain on Renters\nOver 70% of private renters in the poorest fifth of households spend at least a third of their income on housing. This financial strain is exacerbated by the instability of housing arrangements in the private rental sector, where fixed-term contracts are common, and tenants can be evicted without specific cause after the fixed term.\nThe Universal Credit Challenge\nThe introduction of Universal Credit has further complicated matters by consolidating various benefits into a single monthly payment, often leaving recipients with rent arrears. This system has essentially broken the link between housing benefits and the rent people actually pay, forcing many Britons to relocate due to financial strain.\nConclusion\nThe homelessness crisis in the UK is not an isolated issue but a complex interplay of housing policies, stereotypes, financial strain, and shifting demographics. As the number of homeless individuals and families continues to rise, it is imperative for the nation to address these systemic issues and find lasting solutions. Will the UK finally put its house in order, or will homelessness continue to cast its shadow on the nation’s prosperity? The answer lies in collective efforts and informed policies to ensure that every citizen has a place to call home.\n– **Rising Homelessness**: Homelessness in England is at its highest since 2018, with a growing number of households seeking help from local authorities.\n– **Subpar Living Conditions**: Even when families secure rental homes, they often face substandard living conditions, including pest infestations, dampness, and safety hazards.\n– **Private Rentals Predicament**: The increasing reliance on private rentals has contributed to housing instability, with landlords sometimes concealing defects, leading to further issues for tenants.\n– **Historical Roots**: The surge in homelessness can be traced back to housing policies in the 1980s, such as the right to buy policy, which shifted housing capital but reduced available council homes.\n– **Stereotype Trap**: Media portrayals have perpetuated stereotypes about social housing and benefit claimants, overshadowing the fact that many aspire to work.\n– **Changing Housing Landscape**: A shift towards private rentals has cascading effects on society, impacting poverty, education, employment, and community cohesion.\n– **Financial Strain**: Over 70% of private renters in the poorest households spend a significant portion of their income on housing, leading to financial strain.\n– **Universal Credit Challenge**: The introduction of Universal Credit has complicated matters, leaving recipients with rent arrears and forcing some to relocate due to financial strain.\nAddressing homelessness in the UK requires a concerted effort and informed policies to ensure every citizen has access to safe and stable housing. It’s a collective responsibility to put an end to this silent epidemic and ensure a brighter future for all.",

The “Petra tou Romiou” area is one of the most beautiful coastlines in Cyprus, where, according to mythology, Aphrodite rose from the waves. The Greek name “Petra tou Romiou” (“the Rock of the Greek”) is associated with the legendary Byzantine hero, Digenis Akritas, who, according to legend, kept the marauding Saracen Arabs (7th-10th centuries) at bay with his amazing strength. With one hand he was said to have grabbed hold of the Kyreneia mountain range thereby forming “Pentadaktylos”, the Five Finger mountain, while with the other hand he heaved a huge rock and tossed it into the sea at the Saracens who were trying to land. The rock still remains and thus gave the region its name. The site is a stop on the Aphrodite Cultural route.\nPetra tou Romiou, a rock off the shore along the main road from Paphos to Limassol, has been regarded since ancient times as the birthplace of Aphrodite, goddes of love and fertility.\nAccording to ancient tradition, Aphrodite was born from the waves on the site off the coast of Cyprus. In his Theogony (178-206), Hesiodprovides the following dramatic account of the event:\nAphrodite was then escorted ashore on a shell by the soft breezes of the Zephyrs at the rocks known as Petra tou Romiou.\nThis myth is, of course, most memorably depicted in Botticelli’s Birth of Venus (on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence). A much older rendering of the event can be seen in a fine mural at Pompeii.\nHomer’s account of Aphrodite’s birth is less dramatic. He said she was the daughter of Zeus and the fresh water nymph Dione, at whose bosom she would sometimes seek solace (Iliad 5.370-417).\nPetra tou Romiou means “the Rock of the Greek” and does not refer to Aphrodite but to another myth, that of the Byzantine hero Digheniswho threw the rocks at pirates to protect his lady.\nIt is said that in certain weather conditions, the waves rise, break and form a column of water that dissolves into a pillar of foam. With imagination, this looks for just a moment like an ephemeral, evanescent human shape.\nThere is a long narrow pebbly beach at Petra tou Romiou that extends to either side of the largest rock and its satellites.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_scientists-unite-to-end-climate-emergency-hysteria/content_1177.html": "Scientists unite to end CLIMATE EMERGENCY hysteria\nScientists Unite to Address Climate Concerns with Facts and Reason\nIntroduction\nIn a world filled with climate change debates and fearmongering, a group of 1609 scientists, including two Nobel laureates, has come together to challenge the mainstream narrative. Their declaration boldly states, “There is no climate emergency.” This united effort aims to put an end to the climate hysteria and unfounded fears that have been affecting the U.S. economy. In this blog post, we’ll dive deeper into their declaration and the key points they’ve raised.\nChallenging the Climate Emergency\nThe declaration signed by these eminent scientists emphasizes that there is no cause for panic and alarm when it comes to the climate. They firmly oppose the often unrealistic net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) policy proposed for 2050. Instead, they advocate for a focus on adaptation rather than mitigation, asserting that adaptation strategies work, regardless of the causes behind climate change.\nA Call for Less Politics, More Science\nOne of the central messages of this declaration is that climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. This means scientists should openly address uncertainties and exaggerations in global warming predictions. In parallel, politicians should take a dispassionate look at the real costs and potential benefits of their policy measures.\nUnderstanding Natural Climate Variability\nThe scientists also remind us of the Earth’s history, where natural cold and warm phases have occurred throughout its existence. The Little Ice Age, which ended as recently as 1850, is a testament to these natural climate fluctuations. They argue that the current period of warming is not as rapid as some models have predicted, and it’s crucial to acknowledge these natural climate variations.\nCO2: Not a Pollutant, but Essential for Life\nOne key point raised in the declaration is that CO2 is not a pollutant; it’s essential for all life on Earth. In fact, higher CO2 levels have been shown to promote plant growth and greening of the planet. This is beneficial not only for nature but also for agriculture, leading to increased crop yields. Trees, for example, absorb and store CO2 while releasing oxygen, making them valuable allies in combatting climate change.\nDispelling Myths About Natural Disasters\nContrary to some claims, the declaration highlights that global warming has not led to an increase in natural disasters. There is no statistical evidence to suggest that hurricanes, floods, droughts, or other natural disasters have become more intense or frequent due to global warming. On the other hand, there is ample evidence that CO2 mitigation measures can be costly and damaging.\nMedia Distortion and the Truth About Climate Change\nThe scientists’ concerns extend to the way information about climate change is presented in the media and by politicians. They argue that complex scientific reports often undergo multiple filters before reaching the public, leading to distortions of the actual research findings. This can result in misinformation and misguided policies.\nConclusion\nThe declaration signed by these scientists challenges the prevailing narrative of a climate emergency and urges a more rational and scientific approach to climate issues. It calls for less fearmongering, more open discussion of uncertainties, and an acknowledgment of the benefits of CO2. In an era of heightened climate anxiety, their message reminds us to critically evaluate the information presented and make informed decisions based on scientific facts.",

Northampton University vice-chancellor Nick Petford told a conference in London last week that its new Waterside campus ‘pretty much knows what you’re doing 24/7’ thanks to its use of new technology.\nProf Petford said that the IT system at the campus could even draw ‘heat maps’ of where groups were congregating, based on which buildings students had accessed with their ID cards. He also explained that the attendance of overseas students at lectures was being monitored to check if they were obeying their visa requirements, and how the university kept an eye on every website visited by both staff and students in case they were accessing extremist material.\nNorthampton University was accused of using ‘sinister’ surveillance technology\nSilkie Carlo, director of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This sinister surveillance campus is the horrifying result of institutionalising counter-terrorism and border control policies into public education.\n‘Universities are supposed to be environments for freedom, exploration and learning, not security zones where students are constantly monitored.’\nThe University and College Union, the higher education trade union, said: ‘The insidious use of big data to monitor staff and students on campus risks creating a culture of mistrust.’\nA spokesman for the university said that the Waterside campus did not monitor which individuals accessed particular websites, nor did it look at social media feeds. He also denied that website data would be sent to Prevent, the Government’s counter-radicalisation programme.\nComment:\nThe new waterside campus in Northampton sits by the side of the river Nene, which opened in September 2018 is an all new site, built from scratch. It is a shame that this sanctuary of learning is being used as an opportunity for further encroaching on people’s civil liberty.\nOne of the fundamental cornerstone of learning, is to raise questions, to refute established facts and theories, which is how mankind has advanced historically. The fact that they are being monitored, their online activity tracked and cross-checked, in case it is in contravention of the narrative, that is sad day for learning.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-reform-uk-party-must-be-democratised-immediately/content_1229.html": "The Reform UK party must be democratised immediately\nThe Reform UK party was founded on the 23rd of November 2018 as the Brexit Party Limited, in order to put pressure on the failing Conservative party, who were making a mess of Brexit. In fact, it is fair to say that Theresa May sabotaged Brexit, called an election that she didn’t need to in 2017 and threw away her majority, leaving the government in a stalemate.\nIn April 2019, Nigel Farage launched the Brexit party and within weeks, it was a threat to every single Conservative marginal seat, which could have cost them the election, this made them come to terms, and those terms were, that the Conservatives would respect the will of the people and leave the European Union.\nThe result of this was that Boris Johnson promised to proceed with Brexit and in return, Nigel Farage stood down the Brexit Party candidates and the Conservatives went on to win the election by a huge majority.\nFollowing the complete failure of the conservatives to deal with Brexit correctly, in February 2021, the dormant Brexit party was renamed as Reform UK and then Richard Tice, along with Ben Habib, Ann Widecombe, and a few others, took the party from unknown to the position where it polled more than four million votes in the recent election, which also resulted in the party wining five seats in the houses of Parliament.\nWhat happens now and what needs to be done?\nAt its conception, the quickest and easiest way to form the party was as a limited company, which simplified the process, in order to allow the focus to be on the fight ahead, however, once the election was over, the very first step should have been to democratise the party immediately, or at least to announce the intention to do so as soon as possible, but why is this important?\nAs the party gained exposure and support through the election campaign and in particular once Nigel Farage threw his hat into the ring, the number of paid-up supporters grew rapidly, reaching 65,000 at the last count. However, these supporters do not have any say in the party, as they would do with the other parties and that must change as soon as possible.\nHere is an example, out of well over 600 candidates who stood for Reform UK at the election, only five were elected, the remainder are now in limbo, because technically speaking, they are not candidates, they have no official position, they have no say and they really have no idea where they stand.\nChanges were made at the top, that many supporters are not happy about and once again, they have absolutely no right to vote or even officially voice an opinion, this is not right.\nI am of the opinion that the party should move to a democratic format immediately, all those who are paid supporters should be entitled to vote, they should be organised into their respective constituencies, then the local party could arrange monthly meetings, to include the members, who would then be free to express their opinion about the party and policy. This is crucial if the party is going to become a serious force in the next election, which may not be as far away as people think.\nAt this point, the immediate and most important process must be for the members to elect candidates for each constituency, so that the members choose their candidate, who will be accountable to them and in turn, the candidates would be reassured that they have been democratically elected by their members and have the mandate of the people to campaign for their constituency throughout this parliament, rather than the decision being made hastily as an afterthought at a later stage.\nWhilst many excuse this as being something that takes time, I would argue that it need not take too long, but a simple pledge to implement democracy in a few weeks, or months would have sufficed at this stage, but this has not happened.\nI understand that there are many candidates who are older and may well have no intention of standing at the next election, for those who would like to, it is highly unfair that they have absolutely no idea where they stand.\nThe creation of local party headquarters, which could initially be the use of a social club for monthly meetings and as a physical location for members to discuss issues as and when they wish, would have huge benefits for the party.\nDespite the fact that I decided to stand down, primarily for this reason and the fact that I disagree with the appointment of a CEO who has literally walked in off the street, made a large contribution and leap-frogged everyone to be placed at the top, the reality is, that I had nothing official to stand down from.\nI may have upset people at a local level by taking this decision, as those who are following events will know, Ben Habib has also spoken out about the urgent need to democratise the party, it cannot wait and, in the meantime, the momentum is being lost.\nI have absolutely no objection to the democratic election of local candidates, in that event, I would stand and whoever the members choose would be more than fine by me, but it must be democratic, it must be the choice of the members and the members must have and deserve to have this choice.\nWhilst the party was created and championed by founding members, I am of the opinion that the party not only belongs to the four million voters, but also to the people who have paid to support the party, all those who have promoted it, campaigned for it, and those who see Reform UK as their last hope of saving the United Kingdom, which it is, but in order to do so, this party must be democratised immediately, it must be in the hands of the members and it must be accountable to them, in that regard my position is unwavering and if that does not please some people, then so be it.\nAs I see it, this is a matter of urgency, before the huge support for Reform UK begins to dwindle and wither away, before some very hard-working candidates, who fought so hard and mostly funded their campaigns out of their own pockets begin to lose heart and before the masses begin to feel that the party is not reflecting their wishes, but rather the wishes of one man, and that would be catastrophic.\nSummary\nIn short, if the party is going to maintain the current momentum and keep their supporters engaged and continue to grow, it must be democratised immediately to enable the following:\n- Supporters to become voting members\n- Members will have the right to select and vote for their local candidates.\n- All existing former candidates who would like to stand in the future to be elected locally and be official PPCs.\n- Members will have a say in party policy and leadership\n- The creation of local party headquarters for party meetings and for members to meet, discuss policy and vote.\nFailure to address these issues post haste will be detrimental to the party and the support will suffer, we have come too far to allow this to happen. This party belongs to the people I stand for democracy in every manner and that is what I have been fighting for, in the event that there is no will to address this, then it will appear that I have been labouring under a misapprehension.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_kingdom-of-cyprus/content_576.html": "THE KINGDOM OF CYPRUS 1192-1489\nThe Kingdom of Cyprus was a Crusader state that existed between 1192 and 1489. It was ruled by the French House of Lusignan. It comprised not only the island of Cyprus, but also had a foothold on the Anatolian mainland: Antalya between 1361 and 1373, and Corycus between 1361 and 1448.\nThe island of Cyprus was conquered in 1191 by King Richard I of England during the Third Crusade, from Isaac Komnenos, an upstart local governor and self-proclaimed emperor of the Byzantine Empire. The English king did not intend to conquer the island until his fleet was scattered by a storm en route to the siege of Acre and three of his ships were driven to the shores of Cyprus. The three ships were wrecked and sank in sight of the port of Limassol.\nThe shipwrecked survivors were taken prisoner by Komnenos and when a ship bearing King Richard’s sister Joan and bride Berengaria entered the port, Komnenos refused their request to disembark for fresh water. King Richard and the rest of his fleet arrived shortly afterwards. Upon hearing of the imprisonment of his shipwrecked comrades and the insults offered to his bride and sister, King Richard met Komnenos in battle. There were rumours that Komnenos was secretly in league with Saladin in order to protect himself from his enemies the Angelos family, the ruling family in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople.\nControl of the island of Cyprus would provide a highly strategic base of operations from which to launch and supply further Crusade offensives for King Richard. The English army engaged the Cypriots on the shores of Limassol with English archers and heavily armored knights. Komnenos and the remainder of the army escaped to the hills during nightfall but King Richard and his troops tracked the Cypriot ruler down and raided his camp before dawn. Komnenos escaped again with a small number of men.\nThe next day, many Cypriot nobles came to King Richard to swear fealty. In the following days, Komnenos made an offer of 20,000 marks of gold and 500 men-at-arms to King Richard, as well as promising to surrender his daughter and castles as a pledge for his good behaviour.\nFearing treachery at the hands of the new invaders, Komnenos fled after making this pledge to King Richard and escaped to the stronghold of Kantara. Some weeks after King Richard’s marriage to his bride on May 12, 1191, Komnenos attempted an escape by boat to the mainland but he was apprehended in the abbey of Cape St. Andrea at the eastern point of the island and later imprisoned in the castle of Markappos in Syria, where he died shortly afterwards, still in captivity. Meanwhile,\nKing Richard resumed his journey to Acre and, with much needed respite, new funds and reinforcements, set sail for the Holy Land accompanied by the King of Jerusalem, Guy of Lusignan and other high ranking nobles of the Western Crusader states. The English king left garrisons in the towns and castles of the island before he departed and the island itself was left in charge of King Richard of Camville and Robert of Tornham. A subsequent revolt after King Richard left for the Holy Land caused him to doubt the island as a worthwhile gain and eventually prompted him to sell the territory to the Knights Templar.\nThe English invasion of Cyprus marked the beginning of 400 years of Western dominance on the island and the introduction of the feudal system of the Normans. It also brought the Latin church to Cyprus, which had hitherto been Orthodox in religion.\nWhen King Richard I of England realized that Cyprus would prove to be a difficult territory to maintain and oversee whilst launching offensives in the Holy Land, he sold it to the Knights Templar for a fee of 100,000 bezants, 40,000 of which was to be paid immediately, while the remainder was to be paid in instalments. One of the greatest military orders of medieval times, the Knights Templar were renowned for their remarkable financial power and vast holdings of land and property throughout Europe and the East. Their severity of rule in Cyprus quickly incurred the hatred of the native population.\nOn Easter Day in 1192, the Cypriots attempted a massacre of their Templar rulers; however, due to prior knowledge of the attack and limited numbers of troops, the Knights had taken refuge in their stronghold at Nicosia.\nA siege ensued and the Templars, realising their dire circumstances and their besiegers’ reluctance to bargain, sallied out into the streets at dawn one morning, taking the Cypriots completely by surprise. The subsequent slaughter was merciless and widespread and though Templar rule was restored following the event, the military order was reluctant to continue rule and allegedly begged King Richard to take Cyprus back. King Richard took them up on the offer and the Templars returned to Syria, retaining but a few holdings on the island.\nA small minority Roman Catholic population of the island was mainly confined to some coastal cities, such as Famagusta, as well as inland Nicosia, the traditional capital. Roman Catholics kept the reins of power and control, while the Orthodox inhabitants lived in the countryside; this was much the same as the arrangement in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The independent Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus, with its own archbishop and subject to no patriarch, was allowed to remain on the island, but the Roman Catholic Latin Church largely displaced it in stature and holding property.\nIn the meantime, the hereditary queen of Jerusalem, Sybilla, had died and opposition to the rule of her husband, Guy of Lusignan, greatly increased to the point that he was ousted from his claim to the crown of Jerusalem. Since Guy was a long-time vassal of King Richard, the English king looked to strike two birds with one stone; by offering Guy de Lusignan the kingdom of Cyprus, he allowed his friend the opportunity to save face and keep some sort of power in the East whilst simultaneously ridding himself of a troublesome fief. It is unclear whether King Richard gave him the territory or sold it and it is highly unlikely that King Richard was ever paid, even if a deal was struck] In 1194, Guy de Lusignan died without any heirs and so his older brother, Amalric, became King Amalric I of Cyprus, a crown and title which was approved by Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor.\nAfter the death of Amalric of Lusignan, the Kingdom continually passed to a series of young boys who grew up as king. The Ibelin family, which had held much power in Jerusalem prior its downfall, acted as regents during these early years. In 1229, one of the Ibelin regents was forced out of power by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who brought the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines to the island. Frederick’s supporters were defeated in this struggle by 1233, although it lasted longer in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and in the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick’s Hohenstaufen descendants continued to rule as kings of Jerusalem until 1268 when Hugh III of Cyprus claimed the title and its territory of Acre for himself upon the death of Conrad III of Jerusalem, thus uniting the two kingdoms. The territory in Palestine was finally lost while Henry II was king in 1291, but the kings of Cyprus continued to claim the title.\nLike Jerusalem, Cyprus had a Haute Cour (High Court), although it was less powerful than it had been in Jerusalem. The island was richer and more feudal than Jerusalem, so the king had more personal wealth and could afford to ignore the Haute Cour. The most important vassal family was the multi-branch House of Ibelin. However, the king was often in conflict with the Italian merchants, especially because Cyprus had become the centre of European trade with Africa and Asia after the fall of Acre in 1291.\nThe kingdom eventually came to be dominated more and more in the 14th century by the Genoese merchants. Cyprus therefore sided with the Avignon Papacy in the Great Schism, in the hope that the French would be able to drive out the Italians. The Mameluks then made the kingdom a tributary state in 1426; the remaining monarchs gradually lost almost all independence, until 1489 when the last Queen, Catherine Cornaro, was forced to sell the island to Venice.",

It was then that the United Kingdom’s national debt surpassed a once-unthinkable milestone, breaching 100% of national income. A generation earlier, such a prospect would have been deemed nigh on inconceivable. Yet, by 2024, this alarming threshold had become so commonplace among mature, advanced economies that it barely warranted a raised eyebrow from economic commentators or the general public.\nWithin the hallowed halls of Her Majesty’s Treasury, a palpable sense of despair has taken hold. Civil servants and ministers alike are at their wits’ end, metaphorically tearing their hair out in frustration. The cause of their distress? Yet another of those dreaded “external shocks” that seem to buffet the global economy with alarming regularity has come crashing onto British shores.\nTo their absolute horror, government ministers find themselves bereft of the fiscal buffers necessary to cushion the blow of this latest economic tempest. The cupboard, as they say, is bare.\nBut the situation is about to deteriorate even further. In a nightmarish turn of events, international investors have abruptly lost faith in the United Kingdom’s ability to service its mountainous debts. A so-called “buyers’ strike” has taken hold in the UK gilts market—the trading arena for government bonds. This sudden crisis of confidence threatens to upend decades of relative stability in British government financing.\nAs panic sets in, the pound sterling enters freefall, plummeting against major global currencies. Simultaneously, interest rates rocket skyward, further exacerbating the government’s borrowing costs and severely undermining its ability to tap bond markets for much-needed funds.\nFaced with this fiscal calamity, desperate times call for desperate measures. In a move that would have been unthinkable just a few years prior, the independence of the Bank of England—a cornerstone of UK economic policy since 1997—is summarily suspended. Central bank officials receive direct instructions to fire up the printing presses, creating money out of thin air to meet the government’s burgeoning spending needs.\nThe consequences are swift and severe. Inflation, which had been relatively contained for years, suddenly takes off like a rocket. The value of the pound, already under immense pressure, falls further still. Britain finds itself caught in a vicious downward spiral, descending rapidly into economic, social, and political chaos.\nIt’s crucial to note that this harrowing scenario remains, for now, a description of a possible future. There’s no certainty that events will unfold precisely in this manner. However, the trajectory is clear, and the potential for such a fiscal crisis looms larger with each passing day. Indeed, if decisive action isn’t taken to alter course, our imagined financial meltdown may materialise even sooner than 2034.\nFor those willing to look closely, there are already subtle indications of strain within the gilts market. Yields on government bonds are arguably higher than one might expect, given the anticipated trajectory of the Bank of England’s official policy rate. More worryingly, credit risk—the possibility that the UK might default on its debt obligations—is beginning to creep into investors’ calculations.\nOne of the most vexing aspects of this looming crisis is the uncertainty surrounding the point of no return. At what level of indebtedness do the markets finally lose patience? The fact that public debt has already risen to such dizzying heights without triggering a catastrophic loss of confidence has bred a dangerous complacency among policymakers.\nMichael Saunders, a respected voice in British economic circles who formerly served on the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee and now advises Oxford Economics, offers a sobering perspective. He argues that no responsible government would willingly test the markets to determine where the breaking point lies. The potential consequences, he warns, are simply too dire to contemplate.\nTo fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, it’s worth reflecting on Britain’s economic history. The last time the UK faced an outright buyers’ strike in debt markets was nearly six decades ago, in 1976. That crisis forced James Callaghan’s Labour government to suffer the humiliation of seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nWhile the circumstances and structure of debt markets have evolved significantly since then, it’s worth noting that the national debt in 1976 stood at less than half of its current level relative to national income. This sobering comparison underscores a crucial point: a catastrophic loss of market confidence can strike with frightening suddenness, often when least expected. The recent market turmoil triggered by Liz Truss’s ill-fated mini-Budget serves as a stark reminder of this reality.\nAs Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, puts the finishing touches on her inaugural Budget speech, scheduled for later this month, it is this overarching threat that must inform every decision she makes. The spectre of a debt crisis looms large, casting a long shadow over her policy choices.\nIn her efforts to position Labour as a credible party of government, Reeves has made a calculated decision to adopt a fiscally conservative stance. She’s committed herself to roughly the same set of fiscal rules as her Conservative predecessors, including the critical pledge to reduce debt as a percentage of national income by the fifth year of the forecast period.\nYet herein lies the rub: Reeves simultaneously harbours ambitious plans to significantly increase spending on public works projects. She views these investments as essential for stimulating long-term economic growth and addressing Britain’s chronic productivity challenges. Meanwhile, the pressures on government spending continue to mount relentlessly across a broad spectrum of areas—from bolstering national defence capabilities to funding the green energy transition and caring for an rapidly ageing population.\nReeves has already found herself caught between a rock and a hard place. In a bid to end months of industrial unrest, she acquiesced to inflation-busting pay demands from public sector unions. This decision alone has added nearly £10 billion to the government’s annual wage bill—a significant sum that will need to be accounted for in future budgets.\nFurther complicating matters, the Chancellor has promised to maintain several costly spending commitments inherited from her predecessors. Chief among these is the controversial “triple lock” guarantee on state pensions. According to projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), maintaining this policy over the long term could add a further 8% of GDP to the national debt, compared to less generous forms of pension indexation.\nReeves has been unequivocal in her stance on austerity: there will be no return to the swingeing public spending cuts that characterised much of the past decade under Conservative rule. Yet, in a bid to neutralise potential Tory attacks accusing Labour of planning a “tax bombshell,” she’s also ruled out increases to the four primary sources of government revenue: income tax, VAT, National Insurance contributions, and corporation tax.\nThis self-imposed strait jacket presents a significant challenge. Together, these four taxes account for a whopping three-quarters of all government income. By taking them off the table, Reeves has left herself scrambling to identify alternative revenue-raising measures in the more obscure corners of the tax system.\nTo many observers, this long list of seemingly contradictory promises, aims, and commitments appears to present an impossible conundrum. How can Reeves simultaneously increase public investment, maintain expensive policy commitments, avoid spending cuts, and rule out major tax increases—all while reducing the national debt as a share of GDP? It’s a circle that even the most skilled political geometrician would struggle to square.\nYet Britain’s debt predicament is far from unique. Indeed, it’s a challenge shared by virtually all mature, advanced economies of any significant size. Drawing on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we can see that gross national debt in the United States currently stands at 123% of GDP. In France, the figure is 112%, while Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio hovers around 104%. Italy, long considered one of Europe’s more fragile economies, carries a debt burden equivalent to 139% of its annual economic output.\nBut perhaps the most extreme case is that of Japan. The world’s third-largest economy labours under a truly mind-boggling debt load, with gross national debt standing at an eye-watering 255% of GDP. This astronomical figure serves as a stark reminder of the potential long-term consequences of sustained deficit spending and economic stagnation.\nAs Britain navigates these treacherous fiscal waters, the stakes could not be higher. The decisions made by Rachel Reeves and her successors in the coming years will shape the economic fortunes of the United Kingdom for generations to come. Will they find a way to thread the needle, balancing the competing demands of public investment, fiscal responsibility, and market confidence? Or will Britain ultimately succumb to the weight of its debts, triggering a crisis that could reshape the economic and political landscape of the nation?\nOnly time will tell. But one thing is certain: the clock is ticking, and the margin for error is rapidly diminishing. As Britain hurtles towards that £3 trillion debt milestone, the need for clear-eyed, decisive action has never been more urgent.",

Unraveling the intricate web of where all the billions have gone will take years of arduous investigations by legions of auditors and forensic accountants. Sadly, the stark reality is that the vast majority of the misappropriated funds may never be recovered, lost forever to graft and corruption.\nWhile some nations like Italy and Greece did see a short-term economic boost from the influx of recovery cash correctly allocated, this type of fleeting stimulus was entirely predictable. Simply flooding economies with money tends to provide an ephemeral sugar high before the eventual hangover sets in. The real question is how much of the fund was channeled into productive long-term investments that will pay dividends by structurally strengthening and modernizing European economies for years to come?\nA Political Firestorm Looms\nThe staggering amount borrowed to finance the recovery fund will inevitably come due, and the burden of repayment will fall squarely on the shoulders of European taxpayers, primarily in economic powerhouses like Germany and the Netherlands. EU bureaucrats are already floating the idea of levying new taxes upon member states to cover the mountain of debt taken on.\nIf the recovery funds were invested judiciously in value-generating initiatives, citizens may begrudgingly accept the need for harsh austerity measures to restore fiscal balance. However, if it becomes apparent that these billions were simply squandered through incompetence and graft, the political backlash could potentially be catastrophic for the future cohesion of the entire European project.\nIndeed, advocates of the recovery fund envisioned it as merely the opening salvo, with additional rounds of common EU borrowing to underwrite ambitious programs tackling climate change, reindustrializing the continent, and rebuilding depleted defense capabilities. But in the wake of this avalanche of fraud scandals, no nation will likely be willing to extend further credit to Brussels. The EU’sirst and potentially last foray into common debt mutualization may mortally wound its ability to finance Europe’s big-ticket priorities through shared borrowing.\nThe UK’s Fortunate Escape\nWhile the UK’s post-Brexit economy has stagnated amid a dearth of deregulation and an ever-expanding public sector, the British ultimately dodged a fiscal bullet by avoiding entanglement in the recovery fund quagmire. As a major net contributor to EU finances prior to its departure, the UK would likely have been on the hook for billions in recovery fund liabilities had it remained part of the bloc.\nJust consider the substantial tax hikes and spending cuts already necessitated by the UK’s own borrowing binge to deal with the pandemic’s economic toll. Imagine if that fiscal straitjacket were tightened even further by the need to pay down a share of the EU’s disastrous Covid fund debt? The pressure on British family finances and public services could have proven politically ruinous for whichever party was in power.\nInstead, the UK at least retains the sovereign flexibility to manage its own finances without being shackled to Brussels’ deepening insolvency crisis. While hardly satisfactory in its current muted form, Brexit has at minimum insulated Britain from becoming ensnared in another ratcheting-up of pan-European fiscal integration and risk mutualization.\nA Dim Future\nThe recovery fund debacle may truly represent a nadir from which the European project cannot recover in its current form. By betraying the public trust through mismanagement and corruption on a continental scale, the EU has likely extinguished any remaining taxpayer appetite for further attempts at unified debt issuance, let alone the grand dreams of “ever closer union” codified in its founding treaties.\nThe Covid recovery fund was supposed to showcase the solidarity and collective financial firepower of the bloc, restoring faith in the European ideal as a bulwark against tides of populism and Euroskepticism. Instead, it has reinforced the worst caricatures of an aloof, unaccountable bureaucracy deploying a firehose of public funds with reckless abandon.\nIf the past is prologue, the recovery fund affair will usher in a new era of grinding fiscal austerity, recriminations and a resurgence of petrifying hostility between debtors and creditors, North and South. Only this time, the seething resentments and existential doubts about the European experiment will have been stoked by the EU’s own leadership, not forces beyond its control. The ultimate recovery may be the EU itself trying to resurrect its raison d’etre from the rubble of its biggest own-goal yet.",

A Democratic Unionist Party source has told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg they will back Mrs May in a confidence vote. In normal times, such a crushing defeat on a key piece of government legislation would be expected to be followed by a prime ministerial resignation. But Mrs May signalled her intention to carry on in a statement immediately after the vote.\n“The House has spoken and this government will listen,” she told MPs.\nShe offered cross-party talks to determine a way forward on Brexit. President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said he regretted the outcome of the vote and that he urged the UK government to “clarify its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible”\nIf MPs vote to back a no confidence motion, the government, or anyone else who can command a majority, would get 14 days to win a further confidence vote. If they can’t win that, a general election will be then held. Some 118 Conservative MPs voted with the opposition parties against Mrs May’s deal\nIn my opinion, it was a mistake to appoint a ‘Remainer’ to be the ambassador for Brexit, why did she call an election when she didn’t need to, giving away her majority, this has done little more than to give the UK nearly three years of uncertainty, with our pound slipping constantly and people not knowing where they stand.\nHad she incorporated all EU law in to British law immediately, rather than announcing that policy months later, then making emergency provisions for a hard Brexit, the dust would have settled long ago. Instead, we have been subjected to months and months of scaremongering, uncertainty and division.\nWe are not out of the woods yet!",

This move represents the latest indication of Labour’s readiness to revisit certain Brexit arrangements.\n## Northern Ireland Secretary’s Pivotal Declaration\nThe Rt Hon Hilary Benn MP, serving as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, has made a substantial commitment: should new European packaging regulations threaten to disrupt UK companies’ ability to supply Northern Ireland, Westminster would undertake the necessary steps to realign British legislation with EU standards.\nThis pronouncement emerged following Mr Benn’s rejection of a formal request from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to employ the “Stormont brake” mechanism, which would have prevented the implementation of these new regulations. The situation underscores the complex interplay between post-Brexit arrangements and Northern Ireland’s unique position.\n## The Northern Ireland Context\nThe circumstances surrounding this development are deeply rooted in the existing Brexit framework. Northern Ireland continues to operate under the influence of hundreds of European Union regulations that do not apply to the remainder of the United Kingdom—a direct consequence of the Brexit agreement designed to prevent the establishment of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.\nThe regulation in question establishes standardised European requirements for the packaging and labelling of chemicals, encompassing detailed specifications such as permitted typefaces and spacing requirements for hazard descriptions.\n## Strategic Timing and Diplomatic Considerations\nThe Government’s decision to refrain from blocking this regulation appears strategically timed, avoiding potential friction with the European Union ahead of Sir Keir Starmer’s scheduled meeting with European leaders on 3rd February in Brussels. This meeting aims to initiate discussions regarding enhanced cooperation across trade, defence, and foreign policy domains.\n## Chemical Regulation Agreement Aspirations\nAs part of the broader “reset” in post-Brexit relations, the United Kingdom is actively pursuing an agreement with the EU concerning chemical regulations. Brussels has made its position clear: such an arrangement would necessitate British alignment with EU regulatory standards.\n## Official Communication and Commitment\nIn his official correspondence to Edwin Poots, the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr Benn articulated the Government’s position with notable clarity: “We shall implement necessary measures to prevent the emergence of new regulatory barriers stemming from our classification, labelling and packaging protocols for chemicals that might compromise supplies to Northern Ireland.”\nHe further expanded on this commitment, stating that “The Government shall explicitly undertake consultation regarding the implementation of a uniform regime across the United Kingdom, should this prove necessary to safeguard the integrity of the UK internal market.” This additional assurance appears designed to placate the DUP, which had previously suspended its participation in Stormont for two years due to disagreements over post-Brexit trading arrangements.\n## Historical Context: The First Use of the Stormont Brake\nDecember witnessed a significant political manoeuvre when the DUP initiated a motion to activate the “Stormont brake” concerning the EU Regulation on Chemical Classification, Labelling and Packaging. This motion received unanimous support from unionist parties and marked the inaugural deployment of this Brexit deal mechanism, which enables Northern Ireland Assembly members to register objections to new European legislation.\n## Governmental Decision-Making Framework\nThe ultimate authority for determining whether the threshold for implementing the brake—defined as rules having “a significant impact specific to everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland”—rests with the UK Government.\n## Benn’s Reasoning and Market Considerations\nMr Benn’s assessment concluded that the threshold requirements for activating the brake remained unmet. He highlighted that labelling regulations already differed between Northern Ireland and Great Britain due to devolved powers. Furthermore, he emphasised the global nature of the chemical market, noting that numerous companies would naturally align with new EU regulations to maintain access to its substantial market.\n## Opposition and Criticism\nThe Government’s stance has drawn sharp criticism from Brexit supporters and unionist politicians. Lord Frost, who served as Brexit negotiator during Boris Johnson’s administration, expressed significant concern, stating to the Telegraph: “Hilary Benn has revealed the true situation. We are being drawn back into the EU’s sphere of influence—and Labour appears entirely comfortable facilitating this process.”\nGavin Robinson, leading the DUP, characterised the Government’s decision as erroneous and “a serious miscalculation” that would “intensify trade complications between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”\n## Future Implications and Political Landscape\nThis development raises important questions about the future trajectory of UK-EU relations and the practical implications of post-Brexit arrangements. It particularly highlights the ongoing challenges of balancing Northern Ireland’s unique position with broader UK policy objectives and international trade considerations.\nThe situation continues to evolve, with significant implications for UK-EU relations, internal UK market dynamics, and the political landscape in Northern Ireland. As these developments unfold, they will likely shape the broader discourse on post-Brexit Britain’s relationship with the European Union and the future of UK internal market cohesion.\nSummary\n• Labour’s government has indicated willingness to align with EU chemical packaging regulations, marking a significant shift in Brexit policy\n• Hilary Benn, Northern Ireland Secretary, promised to rewrite British laws to match EU standards if new packaging rules threaten supply to Northern Ireland\n• The government rejected the DUP’s request to use the “Stormont brake” mechanism to block new EU chemical regulations\n• This decision comes ahead of Sir Keir Starmer’s planned meeting with EU leaders in Brussels on February 3rd to discuss closer trade and policy ties\n• Northern Ireland currently follows hundreds of EU laws that don’t apply to the rest of the UK, due to Brexit arrangements preventing a hard border with Ireland\n• The DUP and Brexit supporters have criticised this move:\n– Lord Frost called it evidence of being “pulled back by the EU’s tractor beam”\n– DUP leader Gavin Robinson termed it a “grave mistake” that would increase trade friction\n– The Ulster Unionist Party suggested this shows the Windsor Framework protections are a “sham”\n• This was the first-ever attempt to use the Stormont brake mechanism, which allows Northern Ireland Assembly members to object to new EU laws\n• The UK government is seeking a broader deal on chemical regulation with the EU as part of improving post-Brexit relations\n• Critics view this as potentially the first step in Labour’s broader strategy to move closer to EU alignment, though rejoining the bloc isn’t officially proposed",

As Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, charts a new course, Britain may need to reassess its own immigration policies in light of continental developments.\nThe Albanian Precedent\nIn a groundbreaking development, Italy has pioneered what could become a blueprint for European asylum processing. On 14 October, an Italian naval vessel departed from the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, bound for the Albanian port of Shen Gijn. Its cargo: 16 asylum seekers, comprising ten Bangladeshi and six Egyptian nationals, all of whom had been rescued by Italian naval forces near the Libyan coastline.\nThis innovative arrangement with Albania represents a significant departure from traditional asylum processing methods. Under the terms of the agreement, Italy maintains the authority to transfer certain categories of asylum seekers to Albanian territory for processing. However, the scheme incorporates careful restrictions: only adult male applicants from countries deemed safe and who are not classified as vulnerable may be redirected to Albania. Women, children, and individuals with health concerns will continue to have their cases processed within Italy’s borders.\nThe Complex Challenge of Returns\nThe necessity for such measures becomes apparent when examining the current state of asylum seeker returns across Europe. According to Eurostat’s revealing figures, a mere 20 per cent of failed asylum seekers are successfully deported from EU territory. This startling statistic illuminates the systemic challenges facing European nations in enforcing their immigration policies.\nThe ramifications of this ineffective return system are far-reaching and occasionally tragic. Consider the case of Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai, whose rejected asylum claim in Norway did not result in his deportation to Afghanistan. His subsequent illegal entry into Britain culminated in the murder of Thomas Roberts, an aspiring Royal Marine, in Bournemouth in 2022. This case starkly illustrates the potential consequences of inadequate enforcement mechanisms.\nGermany’s Mounting Challenges\nThe situation in Germany, von der Leyen’s home nation, provides a compelling example of the pressures facing European asylum systems. Despite targeting a three-month processing window for asylum claims, the average processing time has ballooned to 18.7 months. This delay partly stems from an enduring backlog dating to 2015-16, when Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-border policy led to an unprecedented influx of arrivals.\nThe scale of the challenge is reflected in the numbers: Germany has witnessed an astronomical rise in asylum seekers and refugees, from 613,000 in 2013 to 3.1 million in recent years. This surge has imposed a substantial burden on German taxpayers, while simultaneously straining the country’s administrative and social infrastructure.\nParticularly concerning is the reduction in Germany’s deportation capacity. The number of beds in deportation facilities has dwindled to just 790, severely limiting the country’s ability to manage failed asylum cases effectively. This constraint has had serious implications, as evidenced by the tragic incident in Solingen, where an Islamist attacker whose asylum claim had been rejected, but who had not been deported, committed a deadly knife attack.\nThe European Response\nThe EU’s existing framework for managing returns, established through the migrant return directive of 2008, has proved inadequate for current challenges. A coalition of Schengen nations, spearheaded by Austria and the Netherlands, has recently pressed for modernisation of these procedures through an informal “non-paper” submitted to the European Commission.\nVon der Leyen’s acknowledgement of the need for external processing centres marks a significant shift in EU policy thinking. However, this approach still faces considerable hurdles, particularly from the European legal framework. The European Court of Justice continues to issue rulings that complicate return procedures, as evidenced by its recent decision regarding Afghan women.\nImplications for British Policy\nThe contrast between the EU’s evolving approach and Britain’s position is becoming increasingly stark. While the Italian-Albanian model represents a measured step towards offshore processing, it remains considerably less comprehensive than Britain’s now-abandoned Rwanda scheme, which proposed relocating all illegal entrants to the African nation.\nAs European nations move towards more robust offshore processing arrangements, the Labour Party’s position on the Rwanda plan may require reassessment. The maintenance of costly hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, coupled with continuing illegal arrivals, suggests that Britain might benefit from aligning more closely with emerging European practices.\nLooking Ahead\nThe development of external processing centres represents a significant evolution in European asylum policy. However, it may still fall short of addressing public concerns about immigration control. While European leaders frequently pledge to implement stricter measures – exemplified by Polish Prime Minister Tusk’s recent proposal to prevent asylum claims altogether – translating these promises into effective policy remains challenging.\nAs pressure mounts across Europe for more effective asylum processing solutions, Britain faces a crucial decision point. The possibility of increased migration flows towards the UK, particularly if continental Europe strengthens its procedures, demands careful consideration of available policy options. The coming months and years may well determine whether Britain can develop an asylum system that balances humanitarian obligations with effective border control, while remaining responsive to evolving European approaches.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_government-ev-mandate-now-in-force/content_239.html": "Government EV mandate now in force\nUK’s Electric Vehicle Rules Shift into High Gear\nThe UK government has turned the dial up a notch on electric vehicles (EVs) through newly enacted rules requiring automakers to steadily increase their share of zero emissions cars sold. This acceleration towards phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles raises important questions around impacts on consumer choice, infrastructure readiness, and finding the right balance between environmental needs and market realities.\nNew Sales Thresholds Take Effect\nAs of January 1st, 2023, automakers selling cars in the UK face mandated annual EV sales targets that ratchet up over time, reaching 100% by 2035. This year’s requirement sets the bar at 22% of sales needing to be battery or fuel cell powered electric vehicles. Brands that exceed quotas for polluting models face stiff penalties – £15,000 for every non-compliant internal combustion engine car sold above designated thresholds.\nWhile the UK’s 2035 end target for eliminating petrol/diesel vehicles matches the EU, previously Britain had a more ambitious 2030 goal before pushing it back in 2020. This created more alignment with Europe’s phase out timeline and reduced short-term pressure on automakers. However, ramping up from today’s EV sales penetration of around 17% of new cars sold annually to 22% this year still represents a steep jump. Requirements will continue rising steadily to reach 80% in 2030 before hitting 100% in 2035.\nDriving an Accelerated Transition\nThe logic behind annual sales quotas that inch higher progressively lies in avoiding an overloaded switchover as 2035 approaches. Compared to suddenly expecting automakers and buyers to pivot enmasse at the eleventh hour, more gradual evolution allows various players to prepare. With long fleet turnover cycles, signalling well in advance that combustion engines are on the way out provides clarity for manufacturers to shape investment and production strategies. This gives more lead time to develop models, retool factories, and reshape supply chains. Prescribed annual milestones aim to provide momentum pulling the auto industry inexorably towards electricity.\nFor charging infrastructure providers, clearly telegraphed incremental sales growth informs buildout of essential EV charging stations – whether fast chargers on motorways or slower connections catering to overnight residential parking. Understanding forthcoming demand patterns allows them to identify promising locations and scale up appropriately. This infrastructure rollout remains a huge logistical challenge, but defined gradients for adoption enable planning. Meanwhile, car buyers themselves need time to acclimate to an all-electric reality through greater model availability at reduced prices. Steadily tightening regulations re-orients the entire ecosystem.\nPotential Pitfalls for Consumer Choice\nWhile this structured path no doubt aids various players in pivoting towards EVs, mandated sales percentages pose risks of constraining customer options prior to full phase outs. Consumers may soon encounter situations where brands hit compliance limits on internal combustion engines, refusing to sell additional petrol or diesel variants.\nBy fortune or foresight, some automakers find themselves better positioned for this transition, having jumped further ahead on EVs within current lineups. Mass market brands like Volkswagen offer multiple affordable battery electric models for European drivers to choose amongst, thanks to major investments seeded years ago when diesel pollution scandals struck. Premium players like Tesla focus exclusively on leading-edge EVs while mainstream companies play catch up. Yet others have been slower to electrify – whether smaller brands like Mazda with more limited research budgets or outliers like Subaru where customer buying patterns skew rural rather than urban early adopter.\nBrands lagging on EV options due to late start or narrow margins making investments tougher now stare down the barrel of fines if combustion engines dominate sales. Consumers loyal to these makes now face risks of truncated selections. Suites of accessible petrol/diesel vehicles allowing budget conscious purchases may dwindle rapidly as manufacturers throttle back production volumes to avoid penalties. Worthy fringe models only selling in small numbers could disappear from importer order books and dealer lots as automakers laser focus on mass demand segments.\nBarriers Around Charging Infrastructure Access\nWhile EV model offerings from major brands promise to improve rapidly, another key question hangs around charging infrastructure keeping pace with sales momentum. Industry projections indicate the UK needs to scale public charging points from around 25,000 currently to 300,000 by end of this decade.\nAbsent reliable public networks, drivers without home charging get left behind in this transition. Urban flats, terraced housing, and streets with vehicle parking permutations that preclude running extension cords all face ‘range anxiety’ about distances reachable between top ups. Issues around charging queue frustrations known as ‘charge rage’ at service stations highlight infrastructure strains. Allowing sales quotas to diverge too far ahead of charging capability risks access divides.\nThose lacking driveways or garages find themselves trapped through no fault of their own. Rural communities face similar gaps around network coverage enabling longer trips. And networks powered by renewable energy sources require parallel green grid upgrades to deliver promised environmental benefits. Managing this intertwined chain requires coordination.\nThe Role of Politics\nAs a consumable driving broader political agendas, cars sold today face particularly volatile policy environments. Recent UK political turmoil repeatedly raised prospects of pivots on environmental legislation should leadership change, compromising consistency. While 2035 bans enjoy cross-party support, cracks exist around interim milestones with fears timelines could backtrack should economic conditions deteriorate.\nAutomakers above all desire certainty around targets and timeframes on which to base their complex multi-year production and technology plans. Sudden goalpost shifts driven by political or populist whims waste vast investments, something especially precarious for smaller players with tight margins. Changes also confuse buyers weighing purchase options spanning a decade of use. Finding compromise balancing certainty with flexibility remains key.\nStriking the Right Balance\nFundamentally the push towards electric vehicles channels necessary progress on emissions reductions to tackle unfolding climate impacts. But forcibly upending markets too abruptly risks unintended consequences penalising consumer choice and affordability. Setting the pace of change through annually tightened requirements gives the auto industry critical guide rails while buying time to cultivate readiness.\nEnsuring supportive infrastructure, model diversity, incentives and public buy-in run in lockstep with sales mandates stays essential to safeguard accessibility. As the UK’s electric vision gathers momentum, constructive solutions embracing the transition while minimizing disruption offer the right roadmap.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_labours-economic-strategy-under-fire-as-growth-concerns-mount/content_45.html": "Labour’s Economic Strategy Under Fire as Growth Concerns Mount\nSerious questions are being raised about Labour’s approach to economic growth, with critics suggesting that despite frequent references to growth in speeches and policy documents, the party’s actual plans may be hampering rather than helping Britain’s economic recovery.\nThe criticism comes as Labour’s handling of the economy since taking office in July has drawn increasing scrutiny. The party’s initial strategy of highlighting economic challenges and emphasising a supposed fiscal ‘black hole’ – despite these issues being widely known before they took office – is now being viewed as potentially counterproductive. This approach, seemingly designed to justify tax increases that were not mentioned in their manifesto, has had a detrimental effect on both business and consumer confidence.\nRecent economic indicators paint a concerning picture. The latest quarterly growth figures show a troubling pattern of -0.1%, -0.1%, and +0.1%, effectively indicating economic stagnation. These anaemic growth figures are particularly worrying when considered alongside Labour’s £40 billion package of additional taxation – equivalent to more than 5 pence on the basic rate of income tax.\nThe government’s borrowing situation has become increasingly precarious. December alone saw borrowing of £17.8 billion, with approximately £5-6 billion of this being used merely to service existing debt. The cost of government borrowing, as measured by gilt yields, has now surpassed the levels seen during the peak of the crisis surrounding Liz Truss’s mini-budget. Perhaps most alarmingly, the UK is now spending more annually on debt interest payments than on education.\nLabour’s relationship with trade unions has also raised market concerns. The government’s decision to grant train drivers a 15% pay rise, followed by subsequent demands for further increases, has led to fears that unions have gained significant leverage over government policy. This situation has been exacerbated by perceptions that the current Labour leadership lacks the necessary experience to effectively manage union relationships.\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which employ two-thirds of the UK workforce and generate 50% of the country’s growth, are facing mounting challenges. These businesses are confronting a perfect storm of rising business rates, increased National Insurance contributions, and a 7% increase in the minimum wage (rising to 16% for young workers). This comes at a particularly challenging time as businesses are still recovering from the impact of Covid-19.\nComparisons with New Labour under Tony Blair highlight significant differences in economic approach and expertise. While Blair’s government benefited from having individuals with deep understanding of financial markets in key advisory roles, the current Labour leadership is perceived as lacking this crucial expertise. This deficit in financial market experience has not gone unnoticed by traders and investors.\nThe implementation of various policy measures, including changes to employment law such as enhanced sick leave and maternity benefits from day one of employment, while potentially beneficial for workers, is creating additional burdens for businesses, particularly those operating outside London. These measures, combined with existing challenges, are making it increasingly difficult for businesses to maintain growth and employment levels.\nThe road ahead looks particularly challenging given that many of the announced tax increases have yet to take effect. April will see the implementation of both the National Insurance increase for employers and the minimum wage rise, coming at a time when both consumer and business confidence indices are already showing concerning weakness.\nWith the tax burden already at a 70-year high before these additional increases, there are serious concerns about the potential for achieving meaningful economic growth. The government’s approach to Net Zero policies has also been criticised as potentially adding further constraints to economic recovery.\nThe situation poses a significant challenge for Labour’s economic team as they attempt to balance their political commitments with the practical necessities of fostering economic growth. With markets already expressing concern and businesses facing mounting pressures, the coming months will be crucial in determining whether Labour can effectively transition from opposition rhetoric to practical economic governance.",

Therefore the video only confirms what the girl already admitted to, but what it also confirms is that those boys had zero respect for her, because they took it and shared it. As for her legal representation, we do not know the full story and basing opinion on the famous “somebody said” scenario is the worst thing to do.\nWe must not forget that consent may be withdrawn at ANY TIME!\nOne thing is for certain, there was no recording of her interview, not required by law in Cyprus, but definitely standard procedure in cases as serious as this. The girl was interviewed for hours without legal representation and signed a confession without legal representation, now this IS ILLEGAL! In Cyprus the accused must have legal representation and only if they flatly refuse and then, sign a statement declaring that they DO NOT want legal representation in front of a whiteness, can they proceed without. That did not happen in this case.\nThe Brit teen’s message breaks off mid-sentence minutes before her arrest!\nCredit: COLLECT\nTherefore, so far we have an illegal interview, an illegally gained confession, boys who had so little respect for the girl that they filmed her and then released the video which would be a serious offence in the UK, but at the very least, it displays what kind of people they must be.\nWho were the officers who conducted this interview? Why have they not explained themselves? What will be done about their interview technique, which at best is gross negligence, but at worst, a blatant, premeditated and illegal abuse of procedure?\nQUESTIONS AROUND INVESTIGATION\n- Police reports of the incident seen by The Sun have also raised further questions about the conduct of the investigation\n- Medical examinations of two Israelis found “suspicious scratches” and bruises on their backs and chests, as if they had been in a struggle.\n- They told detectives they had been attacked at the hotel by the girl’s friends.\n- The hotel’s manager insisted no such fight took place.\n- An early police report noted how “suspect No1” — the teenager’s holiday fling partner — had changed his story.\n- Another Israeli recalled meeting five of his friends heading towards the room 30 minutes before the alleged attack occurred.\n- When suspect No1 was asked what his plans were, he allegedly said the girl was coming to the room for “an orgy.” As his four friends laughed, he is said to have added: “Everyone will have sex with her.”\n- The teenager, who grew up in rural Derbyshire, is described by friends as popular and “party loving”.\n- She had been in Ayia Napa on a working holiday for a fortnight before the alleged attack — staying at the two-star Pambos Napa Rocks hotel.\n- The Israeli group, some having a last break before three years’ military service, were also at the hotel, which is well known for its pool parties. A source said: “They were living it up, ogling the girls round the poolside and shouting things to each other in Hebrew like ‘All English girls are hookers!’”",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-day-that-ireland-defied-the-eu-on-the-lisbon-treaty/content_819.html": "The day that Ireland defied the EU on the Lisbon treaty\n“Ireland’s ‘No’ to the EU: A Triumph of Democracy or Elitism?”\nIntroduction\nIn a world where democracy is cherished as the cornerstone of society, it’s disheartening to witness a scenario where the resounding voice of the people is met with skepticism and disdain. This is precisely what unfolded in Ireland when, on the 12th of June 2008, 53.4% of Irish voters rejected the Lisbon Treaty, setting the stage for a political maelstrom. In this article, I explore the implications of the EU’s decision to push for a second referendum and the consequent uproar, revealing a stark contrast between democratic values and elitism.\nA Hypothetical Scenario\nImagine, for a moment, if the Republican party in the United States, following Barack Obama’s election in that same year, by 52.9% of American voters, insisted on a second election because they garnered just 45.7% of the votes. In this hypothetical situation, they might label Obama’s victory as a “triumph of ignorance” and call for another election to “get it right.” The outrage and indignation that would ensue are easy to predict.\nIreland’s “No” and the EU\nNow, consider Ireland. In a similar vein, Ireland’s 53.4% rejection of the Lisbon Treaty was treated as the “wrong” answer, as if the Irish had failed a simple math exam. This mindset is a grave misjudgment of democracy, one that goes to the core of the European Union’s philosophy. A majority of Irish people said “no,” making it the legitimate, sovereign, and final answer. “No” truly means “no.”\nThe Irish Experience\nThe Irish were subjected to a barrage of derogatory comments when they voted against the Lisbon Treaty. Some referred to them as “ungrateful bastards” because Ireland had received financial support from the EU. Others blamed “populist demagogues” for manipulating the Irish vote and insisted that the EU’s plans should not be “derailed by lies and disinformation.”\nThere were claims that the Irish did not comprehend the treaty due to its “technocratic, near incomprehensible language.” This line of thinking insinuates ignorance on the part of the Irish people, a sentiment that is not only misplaced but also offensive.\nA History of Rejection\nThis was not the first time European nations had rejected EU initiatives. In 2005, both France and the Netherlands voted against the European Constitution, an agreement that bears similarities to the Lisbon Treaty. Yet, instead of understanding and respecting the democratic will of the people, these rejections were met with contemptuous comments and accusations of ignorance.\nThe EU’s Response\nThe EU’s attempts to force through the constitution and later the Lisbon Treaty, despite their democratic rejection, paint a picture of a corrupt, outdated oligarchy, seemingly detached from the people they are meant to represent. The Irish people, like many others in Europe, are passionate about the idea of a united Europe. Their rejection was not a rejection of Europe itself but of a document produced by an aloof European elite who seem to mistrust the continent’s citizens.\nConclusion\nThe Irish “No” vote to the Lisbon Treaty is a striking example of the tension between democratic values and elitism within the EU. It’s a reminder that democracy should be more than just a buzzword; it should be the bedrock upon which political decisions are made. As we watch this ongoing saga, we can only hope that the EU recognizes the importance of respecting the voices of its member states and their people, rather than seeking to impose its will from on high.\nIn the wake of the Irish rejection of the Lisbon Treaty and the subsequent demand for a second referendum, it’s evident that a significant clash exists between democratic principles and EU elitism. The situation raises crucial questions about the EU’s commitment to respecting the voices of its member states and their citizens:\n– The EU’s decision to push for a second Irish referendum underscores a disregard for the democratic process and the will of the people.\n– The perception that “No” votes were a mistake or a result of misunderstanding is fundamentally flawed, undermining the principles of democracy.\n– Historical examples of similar rejections, such as the French and Dutch votes against the European Constitution, reveal a consistent pattern of contemptuous responses from EU officials.\n– The EU’s insistence on imposing its will despite democratic rejections fosters the perception of an archaic oligarchy disconnected from the concerns and values of its citizens.\n– The Irish people’s rejection of the Lisbon Treaty does not signify a rejection of Europe but rather a document produced by a distant European elite.\nIn summary, the Irish “No” vote highlights a pressing need for the EU to reevaluate its approach, placing a higher value on respecting democratic processes and the sovereignty of its member states.\nIt is quite interesting how the media has shifted positions over the years, The Guardian made this very point back in 2008, before the days when it decided to scaremonger the entire nation about the catastrophic consequences to the UK, should it leave this infernal, autocratic failed experiment.",

Other countries will be inspired by this,” taxation minister Jeppe Bruus of the centre-left Social Democrats said in a statement on Tuesday.\nWhile subject to approval by parliament, political experts expect a bill to pass following the broad-based consensus. The deal proposed taxing farmers 300 Danish kroner (£34) per tonne of CO2 in 2030, increasing to 750 kroner by 2035.\nFarmers will be entitled to an income tax deduction of 60 per cent, meaning that the actual cost per tonne will start at 120 kroner and increase to 300 kroner by 2035, while subsidies will be made available to support adjustments in farm operations.\nThe average Danish cow produces six tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to green think-tank Concito, meaning the lower tax rate of 120 kroner would incur a charge of about 720 kroner, or £82.\nThe tax could add an extra cost of 2 kroner per kilo of minced beef in 2030, minister for economic affairs Stephanie Lose told public broadcaster DR. Minced beef retails from around 70 kroner per kilo at Danish discount stores.\nNew Zealand this month scrapped plans to introduce a similar tax after facing criticism from farmers. But while Danish farmers had expressed concerns that the country’s climate goals could force them to lower production and cut jobs, they said the compromise makes it possible to maintain their business.",

She and her daughter were reported missing in May 2018.\nThe fact that authorities were searching specific areas on Saturday – the reservoir and back at the mine – indicated early on that they might be looking for more than one victim, though they did not state this publicly. On Saturday neither did they rule out that there might be even more victims. Reports were already emerging that there may be two more bodies in the mine shaft.\nThe developing scenarios have already prompted speculation that Cyprus might be experiencing its first recorded incidence of serial killings, but authorities would first have to link the murders to the suspect, and find a common thread or modus operandi if there are more bodies found. One angle they are likely to look at in the case of the second victim is her social media accounts since Tiburcio met the suspect on Badoo and had arranged to meet through that medium.\nReports on Saturday said police had already located the Badoo accounts of additional women that have been reported missing, and would be assessing whether they were also in contact with the 35-year-old suspect, who is a father of two but estranged from his wife.\nA post-mortem will be carried out on Sunday on the second woman’s body, which reports said was badly decomposed, indicating that it may have been thrown down the shaft before Tiburcio was. Police spokesman Andreas Angelides told reporters: “The priority now is to identify the woman. It would be premature to say anything else at this stage”.\nThe first step will be to identify the woman and establish if she is also on the list of missing persons. There are 32 women on the police missing persons list. Only three are Cypriots.\nIn addition to Mitsero and Xyliatos, police have signalled that other searches in open areas might be on the cards, reports said. Police expect to take more than 100 statements, Angelides said.\nSpeaking at Mitsero, just after crew had pulled up the second body, Nicosia CID chief Neophytos Shailos confirmed they had located a second victim and that it was a woman in the 125-metre mine shaft. He confirmed that the search for little Sierra would continue at Xyliatos at first light on Sunday.\nSearch crews had begun early on Saturday at the lake, having sent an advance team late Friday\nAt noon, state Cybc reported that the search in the Xyliatos area had been called off after no sign of the child was found but the search resumed two hours later with boats and divers.\nAt the same time in Mitsero, crews from the emergency response unit Emak, the civil defence, the police anti-terrorism unit Mmad, and firefighters were preparing to use special equipment to get further into the mine shaft after bringing a former manager on board for expert advice.\nThey too had to stop working before midday due to heavy rain but resumed after a couple of hours. Underwater cameras with lighting had been sent down into the shaft at the beginning of the operation.That was how the body was discovered and later retrieved.\nWhen news emerged that two state pathologists had been called to the scene, it was clear that a body or bodies had been discovered, even without police confirmation. A heavy police presence led by Nicosia CID ensued, which confirmed the find well before police went public with the information. The fact that it was a second woman’s body that was found shocked many people, since the expectation was that they would find the body of the little girl, and not a second adult victim.\nAlso on Saturday, a 30-year-old man who was also being held in connection with the case was released. It is believed his photo was used unbeknownst to him by the suspect – a colleague – on the Badoo platform where the 35-year-old made contact with Tiburcio last year.\nResponding to criticism from various quarters on the police’s failure to conduct thorough investigations at the time when the mother and daughter were reported missing in May last year, the justice minister Ionas Nicolaou also weighed in on Saturday, saying that actions taken by police regarding the specific case would be examined, though what was important at the moment was that the case be solved, he said. He also fended off the notion that because Tiburcio was a foreign woman, that police did not give the case the same amount of attention as they would had she been a Cypriot.\nNicolaou stressed that police do not discriminate members of the public on the basis of their ethnicity or place of origin. “Now is not the time for assigning responsibility, but for ensuring that the police fulfil their duties,” he said.\nOn Friday, police released Tiburcio’s Romanian ex-partner who had been arrested initially.\nTiburcio, had been reported missing on May 5, 2018, by her roommate, who told police that on the previous day she had gone to meet a man she had met on social media, taking her daughter with her. They never returned.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_these-clowns-are-taxing-us-to-death/content_526.html": "These Clowns are taxing us to death\nThe Growing Tax Burden: A Looming Crisis for the UK\nIntroduction\nIn recent times, the people of the United Kingdom have been grappling with an increasingly burdensome tax landscape. Whether it’s direct or indirect taxes, the weight of financial obligations seems to be growing month by month. Paradoxically, as the tax burden increases, our economy falters, and our national debt surpasses our GDP. This alarming trend has led to a dwindling pool of resources for essential public services, and the recent financial turmoil in Birmingham Council is a stark reminder of the precarious state of our local authorities. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the concerning issues surrounding taxation, its impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the need for a reevaluation of our political landscape.\n1. The SMEs Suffer the Most\nThe backbone of the British economy, SMEs, contribute a significant portion, approximately 52%, to our GDP. However, these businesses are taking a severe hit due to the recent tax hikes. The decision to raise corporation tax has hit SMEs hard, stifling their growth prospects. Instead of nurturing these dynamic companies, the government has effectively turned its back on them, a move that threatens the economic health of our nation.\n2. Struggling to Make Ends Meet\nIt is nothing short of a disgrace that individuals earning below the poverty line are bearing the brunt of tax increases. The tax-free income allowance remains woefully low and has been frozen until 2028. This means that, in real terms, people will be contributing more in taxes without seeing an increase in their income. This is money that many people in this category need to put food on the table and cover essential expenses.\n3. Multinationals and Tax Evasion\nWhile individuals and SMEs feel the weight of increased taxes, multinational corporations generate billions of pounds in revenue within the UK while paying comparatively little in taxes. With over £100 billion in online trading last year, many of these transactions involve foreign companies selling products without contributing to the UK economy. This undercutting of UK businesses poses a significant threat to local companies and jobs.\n4. Absurd Taxes in the Name of Environmentalism\nThe government’s approach to taxing vehicles based on their age and emissions is questionable at best. Penalizing owners of older, less compliant vehicles disproportionately affects those who may be less economically privileged. It’s ironic that these taxes are introduced in the name of environmentalism when, in reality, they do little to curb pollution and seem more like a revenue-generating strategy.\n5. A Call for Change\nIn the midst of these tax challenges and economic woes, it’s essential to remember that switching between political parties alone won’t resolve our issues. The current political duopoly often leads people to vote for one party simply because they want to avoid the other. This isn’t democracy; it’s a system that disregards our needs and concerns.\nConclusion\n– The increasing tax burden in the UK, whether direct or indirect, is a growing concern for both individuals and businesses.\n– Despite rising taxes, the economy is struggling, and national debt surpasses GDP, impacting essential public services.\n– Recent financial crises in local authorities, like Birmingham Council, highlight the precarious state of our local government finances.\n– Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which contribute significantly to GDP, are disproportionately affected by tax hikes, hindering their growth.\n– Tax-free income allowances are too low and have been frozen until 2028, further straining individuals struggling to make ends meet.\n– Multinational corporations generate significant revenue in the UK but pay comparatively little in taxes, harming local businesses.\n– Environmental taxes often seem arbitrary and regressive, affecting less privileged individuals who own older vehicles.\n– Meaningful change requires a shift from the traditional political duopoly and a collective effort to hold politicians accountable.\n– It’s time to prioritize the interests of the people and address these pressing tax and economic issues.\nThe growing tax burden in the UK is a cause for concern. It’s imperative that we address these issues collectively and advocate for change.

Following the independence of the island from British colonialists in 1960, these neighbourhoods fell under Turkish-Cypriot administration. As the ethnic conflict unfolded between Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots from 1963 onwards, these Armenians became displaced from their homes for a second time, seeking refuge in the Greek-Cypriot sector. Demetriou analyses the experience of this displacement and the entanglement of the legal, political and subjective spheres that constitute it. She examines the legal and administrative measures that classified those fleeing from Turkish-Cypriot administered areas as Tourkóplikti (struck by the Turks), a label that reinforced the distinction between Armenians and Greek-Cypriots, the majority of whom were displaced in 1974, and were officially classified as ‘refugees’ or prósfiyes. By looking at the difference between Tourkóplikti and prósfiyes, Demetriou interrogates the location of the Armenian minority within the Greek-Cypriot community. She argues that the silencing of minority experiences of the conflict does not merely impoverish our understanding of it, but also perpetuates a blindness to subtle structures of discrimination. Understanding these structures can show how victimization may turn into a domination strategy (such as through the production of a hegemonic rhetoric of refugeehood). Attention to such processes, which develop through and in the aftermath of conflict, might offer a better grasp of the complex patterns of post-conflict prejudice and exclusion.\n‘We are not refugees’, Arpik said with regret when I asked her about the government support her family received after her displacement in the 1960s. She had been describing how the family moved from their native home in the northern part of Nicosia to the southern part of the city. Their move took place after the outbreak of inter-ethnic violence between Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots in late 1963, and the installation of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in 1964 that divided the capital city into a Turkish-Cypriot northern sector and a Greek-Cypriot southern sector. ‘We have been “struck by the Turks”’, she went on to explain: therefore, no, her family did not receive refugee benefits when they sought refuge in the Greek-Cypriot sector. The denial of refugeehood was not about the experience but about the terms used to describe it: hence her regret.\nThe term Arpik used to describe her situation in displacement, Tourkóplikti, is a legal category used by the state to differentiate between members of the Greek-Cypriot community who were displaced before 1974 and those who were displaced in that year (legally classified as ‘refugees’ or prósfiyes). Arpik’s use of this term in the narrative about the experience of refugeehood underscores the entanglement of the legal and political spheres in the experiential and subjective constitution of ‘refugeehood’. That entanglement is the focus of this paper.\nThe terms Tourkóplikti and prósfiyes essentially differentiate temporal displacements (1964 as opposed to 1974). In doing so, though, they foreground the significance of 1974 in the Greek-Cypriot discourse of victimhood. In the summer of that year, Turkish troops landed on the northern shores of the island and occupied the area that has since been declared under Turkish-Cypriot administration. The conflict that came before, and by most accounts precipitated this invasion, had mainly displaced Turkish-Cypriots into self-administered enclaves dotted around the island. The distinction between Tourkópliktiand prósfiyes, then, is chiefly structured by the major ethnic divide that pertains in Cyprus. In this article I want to outline some of the ways in which this temporal distinction between statuses of victimization translates into multiple ethnic differences and perpetuates processes of political marginalization that have been ongoing since Cyprus’s independence. In doing so, I show how refugeehood, and victimhood more generally, cannot be taken for granted as a category of experience: it is not only that people experience ‘being a refugee’ differently, it is also that legal and policy structures seeking to ameliorate their suffering proceed on assumptions about what constitutes such experience and therefore about who is a ‘proper’ refugee. It is thus the implication of the legal in the moral, and the political in the subjective, that I investigate here.\nFrom interviews carried out in 2011 with members of the Greek-Cypriot community who were displaced during different phases of the conflict, it has become evident to me that the timing of displacement is a salient factor in the experience of victimization and survival. It has been made apparent through many studies that this temporal factor is strongly correlated with ethnicity: the overarching structure of this correlation is one in which Turkish-Cypriots were displaced from 1963 onwards, and Greek-Cypriots were displaced in their majority in 1974. This correlation has in fact dominated studies of refugeehood in Cyprus, where the collapse of the temporal distinction into the ethnic has permeated not only the classic studies of the 1970s and 1980s but persists to this day.1 At the same time, it is known that not all members of the Greek-Cypriot community who were internally displaced were driven from their homes in 1974. Yet the Greek-Cypriots who were adversely affected by the conflict prior to the watershed of 1974 have been treated differently by official discourse and practice. This differentiation is most dramatic in the case of the ‘missing’, the description of those who are believed to have perished in the conflict but whose bodies remain undiscovered and whose fates therefore remain ‘unknown’. As the ‘missing’ became an arch-symbol of Greek-Cypriot victimization in the official discourse that developed post-1974, the missing of the 1960s have been persistently discounted from the record.2\nIn the case of the displaced, this has important ramifications for the framing of refugee identity and the patterns of victimization and exclusion in Cyprus. It is the confluence of the two that I want to explore here. Armenian displacement in Cyprus, I will show, has dovetailed with approaches to Otherness that have refused to acknowledge an equality of loss. A serious examination of the mechanisms involved in this double process needs to take account of a series of dynamics that demand a nuanced reading of the Cyprus conflict.\nAdding such nuances is not simply a trope for going ‘deeper’ and ‘adding more detail’ to the analysis of the conflict. It is a crucial factor in seeing the connections between the perpetuation of structures of domination in Cyprus and their interrelation with structures of exclusion and annihilation in the region. The Armenian genocide of 1915 can be said to have initiated a set of political and social dynamics in the Middle East and beyond.\n-\nby creating multiple Armenian communities and amalgamations of ‘diaspora’ (a term that often carries its own assumptions and prescriptions), and\n-\nby providing a script that, among other things, has guided the distinction between ‘friends’, ‘enemies’ and ‘allies’ on the basis of which the interaction between Turkey and other countries has been shaped.\nCyprus is one example of the effects of these dynamics, but it is also more than that. It is a location where the Turkish-Armenian dispute has been exceeded by another (the Graeco-Turkish one), and where the two sets of conflicts have created alliances between victims, just as they have created a clash. Moreover, these two opposing dynamics (alliance and clash) have not been shaped on different levels of politics—say, state and lay, top and bottom—but have been configured on similar levels of legal, policy and public discourse. Cyprus therefore offers us a location from which to look at the legacy of the Armenian genocide within the complexities in which it is enmeshed.Chief among these is the complexity of understanding ‘the Cyprus conflict’ beyond the ethnic binary ‘Greek/Turkish’.3 The Armenian experience is arguably not the only stake in this complexity. Other minority groups who, alongside Armenians, have been officially counted as members of the Greek-Cypriot community post-1960, as well as—more recently—a growing population of migrants, have been experiencing specific patterns of exclusion on the island. Among such migrant groups are also Armenians who fled the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, and Armenians migrating from Armenia after 1989. The patterns of exclusion these groups experience have developed out of the view of the conflict as a binary affair between Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots, yet it is precisely these understandings of ‘Greek-Cypriot-ness’ and ‘Turkish-Cypriot-ness’ that attention to these experiences calls into question. If, for example, particular citizens have officially been classified as ‘Greek-Cypriots’ post-1960, yet have been excluded from the symbolic constitution of this identity, then it is to the premise on which ‘Greek-Cypriots’ have been constituted as political subjects in the postcolonial polity, and the structures of domination inherent in it, that we have to return.\nIn examining the Armenian experience of displacement in Cyprus, it is also difficult to overlook the flight that preceded it, and that established the Armenian community in the Turkish-Cypriot quarter of Nicosia. Thus seen as a second displacement—following the genocide that dislocated Armenians from Anatolia half a century earlier—the displacement of 1963–4 introduces the particularities of communal minority experience to this analysis of refugeehood. Note that, at that point, the genocide was an event that many in the middle-aged group of those displaced from northern Nicosia still remembered as a first-hand experience that had taken place in their childhood. The relations between Armenians and Turkish-Cypriots prior to the Graeco-Turkish conflict on the island have been analysed as exemplary of how linguistic affinities overrode the politics of ethnic enmity in the aftermath of the Armenian genocide.4 The story of the Armenians’ subsequent displacement in Cyprus bears testament to a different phase in the politics of identification. It shows how, post-1960s, displaced Armenians have had to tread a fine balance between identification with Greek-Cypriots and marginalization within that community. The experience of genocide was an important constituent of the management of this balance, but also a determinant in the way Armenians were viewed by Greek-Cypriots. What some might perceive as the ‘self-marginalization of Armenians in Cyprus’ (as one reviewer of this article put it) cannot be interrogated outside the parameters of the political and legal instruments of exclusion.\nThis brings into perspective the complexities of victimization by drawing attention to the ways in which survivors of persecution find themselves reconstituting ‘community’ in environments of discrimination and minoritization processes. The experience of internal displacement in Cyprus is a particularly poignant case in this regard. However, widening the focus also calls attention to post-genocide community-making elsewhere, where we might also ponder similar processes that may have developed among migrant Armenian communities.5 The processes of marginalization within states that are otherwise considered ‘friendly’ to the Armenian cause thus emerge as more complex than political science analyses might suggest.\nTogether, these strands constitute the focus of my analysis here. I take my interview with Arpik as my point of departure for exploring the formation of Armenian refugee subjectivity in Cyprus, a subjectivity shaped within the contours of law, political rhetoric and minoritization.6 Arpik—a pseudonym adopted for this article—may be considered ‘representative’ of a number of Armenians in Cyprus in that she articulates experiences common to many (location of residence, descent from 1915 survivors, membership in community associations, links to diaspora and so on). However, it is not on the basis of this ‘representation’ that I focus on her interview here: such ‘representation’ would indeed be problematic in presuming to standardize ‘an’ Armenian experience.7 My interest in her narrative stems from the way in which she articulates the entanglement of the legal and the political in the subjective, which is in fact a much more universal story than an ‘Armenian identity’ frame might posit.\nRefugeehood as a legal category\nWhereas Greek-Cypriots displaced in 1974 are officially recognized by the state as ‘refugees’ (prósfiyes), those displaced prior to this date are categorized as Tourkóplikti, literally meaning ‘those struck by the Turks’. Post-1974 ‘refugees’ have been the subjects of a number of legal instruments employed by the Republic of Cyprus to regulate access to rights that enable those displaced in 1974 to rebuild their lives in the southern part of the island by alleviating some of the burden of the material losses they had suffered. By comparison, the category of Tourkóplikti has been almost absent in legal documentation: it was a term used in the Greek-Cypriot press to refer to Greek-Cypriots affected by intercommunal conflict since 1960 but it was not transferred to the legal sphere. Moreover, prior to 1974, few provisions were made for the rehabilitation of those displaced by the conflict, and these were policy decisions that were never codified into law. Following 1974, this category has in most instances been subsumed under the laws targeting refugees. By this time, however, the majority of the pre-1974 displaced had already rebuilt their lives and were exempt from the rehousing scheme at the heart of refugee rehabilitation policies.\nBut it is not only Tourkóplikti that is a problematic legal category in Cyprus. The very category ‘refugees’ (prósfiyes) is something of a legal misnomer. This is because the people it has been applied to are in current legal convention ‘internally displaced persons’ (IDPs), having been displaced from homes in the northern part of the island to the southern part. Following the demarcation of the 1974 ceasefire line as the boundary between the northern part of the island administered by Turkish-Cypriot authorities and the southern part administered by Greek-Cypriots, the Republic of Cyprus has successfully argued in international forums that the ‘Green Line’, as it is widely known, should not be viewed as a border between states. Instead, its status awaits designation after an agreement has been reached that will formally end the conflict and determine the status of the two territories in terms of international law. Consequently, refugees in the south cannot be considered to have crossed an international border, which under international law is the legal determinant of ‘refugees’ as opposed to IDPs. Yet, as the war in Cyprus pre-dated the formulation of ‘IDPs’ as a category in international law, reference to those displaced in 1974 as ‘refugees’ is found everywhere, including in the oft-cited United Nations Council Resolution 361 of 30 August 1974 that reads:\n[The Security Council] Expresses its grave concern at the plight of the refugees and other persons displaced as a result of the situation in Cyprus and urges the parties concerned, in conjunction with the Secretary-General, to search for peaceful solutions to the problems of refugees and take appropriate measures to provide for their relief and welfare and to permit persons who wish to do so to return to their homes in safety.\nTherefore, the legal framing of refugeehood in Cyprus is made problematic not only by the term Tourkóplikti, but also by the term prósfiyes. What is more, prósfiyes is a problematic term for precisely the same reason: its implied temporal reference. The difference is that the term ‘refugees’ has become problematic in the international context of redefining the ‘refugee’ label,9 while the term Tourkóplikti appears problematic in the local context of the conflict’s development. This difference may also account for the fact that, in official discourse, ‘refugees’ have also been labelled ektopisthéntes, meaning ‘displaced’. And public discourse has drawn on the faulty application of the ‘refugee’ category to present 1974 ‘refugees’ as exceptionally victimized because they are ‘refugees in their own homeland’ (prósfiyes stin ídhiá tous tin patrídha), an otherwise contradictory designation meant to underscore the unfathomable logic of the Cyprus conflict. Yet this definition of ‘displaced’ has also been constructed to the exclusion of Tourkóplikti, who are not thought to fall in this category. Hence, legal instruments that apply to both categories (for example, laws that regulate benefits) do not make reference to the ‘displaced’ as an umbrella term but refer to ‘those displaced, those harmed, and those struck by the Turks’ (ektopisthéntes, pathóntes, Tourkóplikti) as separate categories. Moreover, these instruments are often reviewed and approved by a parliamentary committee (the Epitropí Prosfíghon-Englovizménon-Aghnoouménon-Pathónton) mandated to oversee matters relating to ‘refugees, the enclaved, the missing, and those harmed’, but not those ‘struck by the Turks’.\nAnother point that needs to be taken into consideration is that the translation of the temporality of refugeehood into an ethnic differentiation within the Greek-Cypriot community is not confined to the Armenian community. The other two minority groups that were, along with the Armenians, officially rendered into ‘religious groups’ belonging to the ‘Greek-Cypriot community’, when the island became independent of British colonial rule in 1960, were also affected. These are the Maronites and Latins, who for different reasons have experienced displacement arising from the conflict in ways that have made them distinct them from the Greek-Cypriot majority.\nMost Maronites were displaced in 1974 from their villages clustered in the northwestern tip of the island. Yet a significant number of them were also enclaved within that area, choosing not to relocate following the establishment of Turkish control there. In these enclave areas the control of the Turkish army has been particularly strong. Since the Turkish-Cypriot administration claimed sovereignty over what it has declared as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983 (a state that remains unrecognized by the UN), the rights it has granted to the Maronites have been minimal. As a result, a number of those Maronites who stayed in the enclaves moved to the southern part of the island controlled by the government of the Republic, and became displaced there long after 1974. Indeed, this is also the case for Greek-Cypriots enclaved in the region of Karpasia. Under this regime of enclavement, Maronites have had easier access to their properties since 1974 and many have repossessed them following the opening of the checkpoints in 2003. However, because of it, they have also been viewed with suspicion among both the majority Greek-Cypriot population and the Turkish-Cypriots.\nEven Latins, who otherwise appear to have been almost completely integrated into the Greek-Cypriot population, have in some instances experienced refugeehood differently. A member of the Latin community whom I interviewed spoke extensively of the opportunities she was given to visit her home on several occasions following the war; she was also allowed to recover items from it at the same time as other homes in the neighbourhood were being looted in a more or less organized manner. On these occasions she was reminded, by the Turkish-Cypriot policemen who escorted her to the house, that she was being granted this opportunity only because she was different to Greek-Cypriots: that is, because she was a Catholic.\nAll this points to the need to approach refugeehood in Cyprus as a condition that is far from self-evident. Instead, it is a condition of subjectivity that is thoroughly invested in the political. The legal structures that have framed this political subjectivity have been constructed out of social understandings of difference and sameness, and the insertion of ‘victimhood’ into that differentiated matrix of ‘the Greek-Cypriot community’. The legal framing has thus worked to prop up interlinking processes whereby displaced Cypriots from minority groups come to experience their displacement and resettlement as a corollary of the nationalist prioritization of the two main communities. It is from this perspective that I approach the story of Arpik as indicative of Armenian refugee political subjectivity.\nExperiencing displacement\nArpik, in her early sixties in 2011, was born in Nicosia and was raised in one of the neighbourhoods in the north of the town. Her parents had themselves moved to Cyprus as children, after being displaced from their native town near Kayseri in central Anatolia. Arpik’s family lived in the neighbourhood—which became part of the Turkish sector after the separation of municipalities in 1958—until 1964, when intercommunal violence broke out. At that point, her parents joined other Armenian neighbours who were moving out and into the Greek sector of Nicosia.\nTo Arpik, the difference between ‘refugees’ (prósfiyes) and Tourkóplikti (those struck by the Turks) signals a qualitative separation in the minds of both the state and other Greek-Cypriots with regard to the conceptualization of her displacement experience. I had the impression by the end of the interview that Arpik claims a share of the trauma and loss of displacement that is equal to that of other Greek-Cypriots, and resents the insinuation that, because she is Tourkóplikti and not a prósfighas (a refugee), she has somehow lost less. This impression builds up throughout her narrative, as discussed below.\nArpik remembers from an early age the neighbourhood as changing in make-up.\nAfter the genocide Armenians thought it natural to settle in Turkish areas because this was the language they spoke, they did not know Greek. In our area there were Armenians but also [Greek-]Cypriots: it had a Greek breadmaker, a flour mill, a cigarette business, big enterprises, not small shops. Then slowly, whoever sold, the Turks would buy. By 1963 there were almost no [Greek-]Cypriots. But the bakery was there.\nArpik remembers moments of happiness that would become materially impossible after they moved.\nI remember that, in the house, we used to sit around the table at dinner times and talk. My grandmother would share stories from life in Turkey, my father from his job, and now I realize that this is something we did not do afterwards. We didn’t have conversations because first of all we did not have space to fit. We would eat one at a time and in a hurry so that the next person could eat.\nHer memories of the kitchen in the house she had left helped Arpik to recognize it when, with the help of a Turkish-Cypriot colleague, she was allowed to visit it before the opening of the checkpoints in 2003 (which made such return visits possible for the majority of displaced).\nIt was winter, and raining, we knocked on the door and she [the old woman now living in the house] would not open it. Then she looked through the window, and my friend explained I wanted to see the house because I was, well, the owner. She didn’t like that at all, but she opened up. She did not invite us to sit and started asking me questions to check [that I was who I claimed to be]. They had come from Paphos and they had stayed in the house before we moved. They were being put up in a neighbouring house around the time we were leaving and our neighbour thought that, since they were taking over the house after we left, we should meet. I remember she asked me whether my mother was still as pretty and whether she was a dressmaker. Only then was she convinced of my identity, and invited us to sit down. The house looked much smaller, but it was still huge. I asked to go to the kitchen and I remembered the cupboard [from my childhood] and the three steps that went down to the kitchen.\nArpik’s parents had decided to leave the house as inter-ethnic violence escalated in 1963. They saw the move as a temporary one, at least in the beginning.\nMy parents would leave us with my grandmother in the morning and go to look for a place. They would go and come back not having found anything because my father thought it would be a month-long arrangement and then we would return, so he did not want to draw up [long-term] contracts … We left on 6 January, Christmas Eve I remember. We brought with us clothes, our carpets, some furniture of value and such things. And we sold them all. Because financially, between the rent and the school fees, it was impossible [to make ends meet]. My mother took up sewing full-time: she used to do it for family and friends up to that point. For as long as my father could pass [the Green Line], with UN permission it was, he would go back to the house and bring stuff. Then one morning they told him he could not go any more, this would be his last visit. He then took everything out of the house, packed it neatly in the garage, which he first cleaned well, and locked it up. There is of course no garage left now, never mind a lock! But that’s why, for example, I don’t have anything to show from my life there, that I can say was my toy or something. I have nothing from there. Everything brought over was sold.\nUp to this point, Arpik’s narration differs little from the narrations of Greek-Cypriot interviewees. The details about the architecture of the house, and the mapping of the memory of those details on to the structure encountered later, parallels the descriptions I collected from Greek-Cypriots who were able to visit their former homes after the opening of the checkpoints in 2003. One differentiating factor is the opportunity of repeated visits following the displacement, and the rescue of valuables under the supervision of the UN. This was not often the case with those displaced in the war of 1974, who generally fled their houses overnight and never returned. Yet it is striking that the care taken to ‘secure’ those valuables left behind, which in the event proved futile, is something that Greek-Cypriot refugees dwell on, describing how they had locked cupboards, front doors and gates behind them, how they worried about their gardens not being watered in the first weeks of displacement, or how they had spent their last moments in the house collecting whatever valuables could be collected. The gendered nuances of memory are also common to Greek-Cypriot women refugees, who recall how displacement threw into disarray the ordering of the domestic, as well as how they were forced into work to make ends meet.\nThe financial hardship experienced after displacement is the point at which Arpik’s account begins to diverge. The financial difficulties the family faced at the beginning marked Arpik’s late teenage years.\nWe rented some backyard shack at the beginning and it didn’t fit much. We were six people in two rooms with a corridor in the middle. It was very difficult to make ends meet but my father sent us to private schools to give us the chance in life he did not get. But I understood the circumstances under which we ended up there and why we were there, so I sympathized. If he couldn’t afford, he couldn’t afford. I did not take it too much to heart. Then we went to a slightly bigger place, still two rooms, but with a hall instead of a corridor. Then a better place still, then other ones and so on. We also grew by that point, we were able to contribute to the family budget and it got better.\nThis divergence from the accounts of Greek-Cypriots grows and becomes a marker of ethnicity, when the subject of state support is discussed.\nMy mother received some support for the rent at some point, but I cannot remember when it began. It was 50 CYP [Cypriot pounds]. It was not immediately after, it was later … perhaps after 1974 … Unfortunately we are not considered prósfiyes. We are Tourkóplikti. Those from 1963 are Tourkóplikti, 1974 prósfiyes. And we did not receive any of the advantages, whereas for you [Greek-Cypriots] there are various options. Sometimes I hear Greek-Cypriot refugees talk about 1974, especially younger people, and I tell them, ‘hey, I’ve lived this since 1963!’, and they are surprised, they don’t know. This is a big mistake and it’s one thing I really want to emphasize: that the Armenians need to be heard, that they lost too … Take our neighbour, Mrs Anna, from Kyrenia, for example: when we would say to her that we lost too, she used to say, ‘oh, but this is something else (állon doúdon)!’. We did not understand at first, then we realized she didn’t count our loss as much as hers. What does this mean? Property is property!\nAnd the distinction between Arpik’s experience and those of Greek-Cypriots becomes even more pronounced when Arpik ponders the displacement of 1974. With personal lives slowly having been rebuilt by the 1970s, the war of 1974 had little effect on her and her family.\nBy 1974 we were all married, the children growing, the family was developing. How did it affect us? It did not affect us. Because we had nothing else to lose. And this is not nice to say, but in 1974 they [Greek-Cypriots] got a taste of their own medicine. Because from the Greeks, in 1963, there was no sympathy for us. No housing: my mother was eventually, and after many years, offered a house in Latsia [a suburb on the southern outskirts of Nicosia] where she had no connections. In 1963 they used to tell us, ‘you came over from the genocide and you went to live with the Turks again?’ [as if to suggest that Armenians deserved what they had got]. They did not understand us … Now they realized that they could also lose things, Kyrenia, Varosha, for example. As long as the loss was ours, there had been no help. And one thing my father said once that I thought was very, very clever: when a [Greek-]Cypriot told him, ‘well, why did you go and live there?’, my father replied, ‘well, you went to live in Kyrenia, didn’t you think that the Turks were only forty kilometres away? Why did you build apartment blocks there?’ The other person shut up.\nConsidering the situation now, when the setting up of the Immovable Property Commission (IPC) by Turkish-Cypriot authorities in the north has made it possible for those displaced to claim compensation for their properties, Arpik returns to the ethnic differentiation that has marked her refugee experience. She is not hopeful about a settlement and has no trust in politicians. She no longer visits her former house and has slowly come to understand the financial stakes for her family.\nOne morning I suddenly woke up and realized that we do not actually have title deeds.… I went to the commission (IPC) and filed an application. I said to myself that my father spit blood to build this house, it is obvious that a settlement will not come: if I don’t do something, our children have no interest in doing anything. They are all abroad now. If it is not me who does something, who has lived there and knows, we will lose it. And I do not want to give it away, neither to the Turks, nor to the Greeks, sorry, it’s my father’s sweat. They lost it once in Kayseri when they left, and it was gone. I am not going to lose it a second time, only five kilometres away. I will not allow it.\nIn saying this, Arpik is making reference to the dispute over the legitimacy of the IPC, which the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) refuse to recognize on the grounds that it is an institution of an ‘illegal state’. On these grounds, the RoC government has been advising Greek-Cypriot refugees not to apply to the IPC, as their property rights would not be respected through such applications. Following a controversial verdict by the European Court of Human Rights that accepted the legitimacy of the IPC in 2010 as a ‘domestic remedy’ (in the Demopoulos v. Turkey case), the RoC has been highlighting the fact that the IPC does not grant reinstatement rights in most cases, and is essentially a compensation-awarding mechanism, and, indeed, an ungenerous one at that. Arpik, like many Greek-Cypriots, is resentful of the ways in which her rights to property are being compromised by both sides in this dispute. And, like many Greek-Cypriots, she rationalizes her decision to apply to the IPC on personal grounds. At the same time, she is acutely aware of the political implications of this decision and does not shy away from framing it as a political act. Her rationalization thus draws simultaneously on a communal discourse of exclusion and on a matter of individual decision-making. This also parallels Greek-Cypriot refugee appeals to the IPC, which may be rationalized on the basis of righting the wrongs that they suffered in distribution of benefits, housing and economic wealth. The difference is that, for those Greek-Cypriots, their exclusion from the material benefits they believe they deserved through the years is staked against the non-refugee population, who have not suffered the loss of property they did. Arpik’s discourse, however, verbalizes a total exclusion from a system that has quantified other people’s losses (even if erroneously) but not hers.\nMinor losses?\nThe resentment that Arpik feels towards Greek-Cypriot attitudes to loss is part of what renders her a ‘smaller’ minority group member in a context in which the majority/minority dichotomy has been set up in reference to Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots respectively. This ‘small’ minority subjectivity differentiates her from particular structures of hegemonic victimhood that have eclipsed and delegitimized other experiences in southern Cyprus. Within that frame, the loss of lands in the north has become a symbolic feature of what I have argued elsewhere is a generalized sense of refugeehood,10 whereby all Greek-Cypriots, refugees and non-refugees, are thought to have lost these lands. Yet Arpik reminds us that this affective sharing is ethnically delimited: as Mrs Anna put it, her loss, as an Armenian, is ‘something else’.\nThe Armenian experience of refugeehood in Cyprus that Arpik describes thus deflects the priorities of state discourse that qualifies displacement as an ethnic attribute and relegates Others to non-victim (for example, Turkish-Cypriots) or lesser-victim (Armenians) status. In official discourse the category Tourkóplikti obviously excludes Turkish-Cypriots and their flight from the experience of displacement. In this discourse, Turkish-Cypriots are rendered aggressors and nothing else, even though scores of them were killed by Greek-Cypriots in the escalating violence of December 1963 and early 1964. History textbooks still describe these events as Tourkoantarsía (a Turkish mutiny), and pay scant attention to the reasons why Turkish-Cypriot parliamentarians resigned their posts and called on ‘their’ fellow Turkish-Cypriots to leave their homes and crowd into cramped enclaves. The pertinent point here is that this period of violence is being projected in nationalist discourse (which, crucially, is also the state’s) as a period of Greek-Cypriot victimization when, in fact, the vast majority of displaced, killed and wounded were Turkish-Cypriots. Naming victims Tourkóplikti (struck by the Turks) makes the victimization of Turkish-Cypriots a historical ‘blind spot’, as it categorically excludes from the conceptualisation of ‘victim’ those who have most claim to the status.11 And it draws Armenians into this historical blockage. Arpik’s insistence on claiming her loss (affectively and financially) works explicitly against this prioritization, and it is to these politics of working within and against structures of governance and sentiment that her story speaks.\nWhat the Cyprus case thus shows, in the frame of this collection, is that the grand ordering of Greek-Turkish antagonism, just like that of Armenian-Turkish antagonism, cannot predetermine positionings of Armenian subjectivity. The 1915 genocide may have been the originary event following which Armenian survivors rebuilt their lives in Cyprus, but it did not predetermine the nexus of personal and communal allegiances in which they operated. Instead, presuppositions about what these allegiances should look like have meant that the rebuilding of their lives has been scrutinized and attended by political priorities that have subsumed Armenian-ness into a single political positioning (siding with Greek-Cypriots). When individual (and indeed collective) lives stray from this, the moral ground of victimization recedes: their loss of home is ‘different’ from Greek-Cypriots’ because they chose to live ‘with the enemy’. The answer that Arpik’s father gave to this argument shows that Armenians—like other communities—are aware of this perspective and the power dynamics it assumes, and that they resist it. This resistance, and indeed the complexities of living with other conflicts post-1915, has often tended to be de-prioritized in the literature on Turkish-Armenian relations in which the genocide is often the only point of focus. In other words, within the frame of the grand ‘political game’ taking place on an interstate level, versions of Armenian-ness as a minority identity may develop that compel us to think how victimization is both very complicated and also always subject to processes of closure. And it is to both of these aspects that we, as analysts, should attend.",

Currently that threshold is 54 MPs.\nLetters are confidential unless the MP sending it makes it public. This means only Sir Graham knows how many letters there are.\nWhat happens when the threshold is reached?\nA vote is held, with the leader technically only needing to win support from a simple majority of MPs\nBut in reality, a solid victory is essential for them to stay in post.\nWhat happens if the leader loses?\nThe leader is sacked if they do not win a majority of votes from MPs, and a leadership contest begins in which they cannot stand.\nHowever, they typically stay on as Prime Minister until a replacement is elected.\nWhat should Boris do now?\nEven though Boris has several achievements to his name, this entire episode confirms one thing, Boris is more concerned about holding the position of Prime Minister, than he has respect for the position of Captain of HMS Great Britain. I first saw this trait when he stepped in to lead the ‘leave campaign’\nBoris was initially a remainer, along with most of the political classes, he clearly saw the campaign as an opportunity to take on a high profile role, in full expectation that it would fail. When Theresa May stepped in, she attempted to sabotage Brexit under the guise of negotiating Brexit, but she failed. Boris won his mandate on the grounds of getting Brexit done, but in reality, he was saying whatever needed to be said, just to get in to office, the rest we know.\nMoving on to the pandemic, the motives for anything that Boris did remain unclear, as far as I’m concerned, the entire episode appears to have been a ‘Boris PR campaign’\nWhilst I respected the fact that Boris appeared to have refused to enforce a lockdown, until the ‘scaremongering Brain-Surgeons’ by his side, presented such an effective scare-campaign, that they forced his hand, even though, none of their terrifying predictions were even remotely accurate. However, behind the scenes, draconian laws were still put in to place, one of the greatest erosion of our civil liberties in decades and Boris did absolutely nothing to stand against the incoming ‘Police-State’\nI do not feel that Boris actually did anything that was so bad and there is clearly an agenda by the media and the inept opposition, who do not have a dingle viable policy, so they simply resort to hiding behind a wall and throwing stones.\nThe problem is thus, trivial as it may seem, if the facts were as Boris had stated, that whilst at a place of work, during a break, when they were outside, he was presented with a cake and a drink, there was nothing illegal about that, after all, there was no law against colleagues eating their lunch together at their place of work, especially outside. As for all the rest of the evidence, it is little more than hearsay, poison that has been drip-fed, probably by the bitter and vengeful Cummins.\nThe problem has been that Boris did not give a clear and comprehensive account of what happened, dealing with it at the time and closing the door, he preferred to hide behind the Sue Grey report, which was little more than a delaying tactic. The problem with that is that Boris allowed this matter to remain in the public domain for longer, with ongoing media exposure, the drama from the ‘holier than though’ Keir Starmer’ and the result has been, that the institution of Government has been humiliated on an international scale.\nThis Bacchanalian culture has discredited the entire cabinet, where the Prime Minister should resonate the throng of ‘Rule Britannia’ it has been more like ‘Twas on a good ship Venus’\nThis is very sad, as the war in Ukraine has demonstrated that Boris is capable of being an international statesman, leading from the front in support of the defence of Ukraine, but that does not erase what happened.\nThe position of Prime Minister is a responsibility, it is greater than any one person, as it is a position where one has an obligation to the nation.\nBoris should have explained himself and called a vote of no confidence immediately, but the path he chose, has dragged the government through the gutter, causing irreparable damage and for this reason, if he really has any respect for his position, he should no go.\nThe problem is, who will replace him, time will answer that question.\nI like Boris, but the damage is too great for him to recover, he is placing us all in danger of a useless Labour Government if he does not got!",

While Corbyn is no longer leader, the party’s attitude towards property rights remains deeply concerning.\nThe War on Landlords continues and in a country failing to build enough homes to meet soaring demand, Labour seems intent on waging war against landlords. From banning property sales in the first two years of tenancies to scrapping no-fault evictions – even though landlords have a right to reclaim their properties after agreed rental periods.\nExcessive Regulation and Taxes punish Landlords who already face over 170 pieces of legislation, from licensing to deposit protection schemes. The Tories have treated them as punching bags too by restricting tax deductions for finance costs. But Labour plans to go even further with damaging policies.\nRent Controls and Wealth Taxes not ruled out, for example, in Wales, Labour has allowed councils to hike taxes on second homes by 300% or force owners to rent half the year. The London Mayor wants rent controls across the capital. And a Labour wealth tax can’t be ruled out to fund spending pledges.\nAll these measures will strangle the rental sector, worsen the housing crisis, undermine property rights as a foundation of prosperity, and deal a severe blow to the UK economy.\nClosing Thoughts:\nWhile the Tories have been bad for landlords, a Labour government would be utterly calamitous – dismantling the very notion that we truly own our properties. Britain is chipping away at property rights and the rule of law at its peril. This radical assault must be stopped to protect housing, the economy and our freedoms.\nRemember to like, share, and subscribe for more incisive analysis on the key issues facing the UK.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_immigration-responding-to-the-haters/content_225.html": "Immigration Responding to the haters\nI had a sudden urge to respond to the haters who are appearing everywhere on my posts, and very welcome indeed they are for this reason. I like to lead by example, but what example is that? It is as follows:\nWhen somebody expresses an opinion that contradicts yours or even offends you, the correct way to deal with it is to:\n1. Take it on board.\n2. Decipher it.\n3. Reflect on it.\n4. Respond in a civilized manner.\nThis is the fundamental basis of democracy, which so many of us are determined to restore to this country.\nLadies and gentlemen, if you are offended or disagree, you do not:\n1. Demand that somebody is canceled.\n2. Resort to calling them a racist or any other number of insults.\n3. Spit your dummy out.\n4. Simply go straight to Snapchat and post a video of yourself crying while you pluck your eyebrows out.\nThese are not the cornerstones of democracy.\nRemember, all solutions begin with dialogue, and you cannot have dialogue when you are determined to gag people who make sense or whom you do not agree with.\nWith regards to the illegal immigrants, despite your unfounded allegations, it has nothing to do with race at all. After all, many of the immigrants coming are European; they come from all different places. If they are illegal immigrants, they are illegal, and they are criminals.\nThe only reason that they are not in prison behind bars for entering our country illegally is because our disgraceful, incompetent government is not enforcing the law. Rather than protect their country, they are more concerned about protecting their image.\nWhich leads us to one of the greatest offenders in starting this mass migration: Mr. Blair himself. For those of you who are not aware, treason was the last defense that was punishable by hanging in this country. It was also the first major change that Tony Blair made when he became prime minister in May ’97.\nIn September 1998, quietly and sneakily, within the Crime and Disorder Act, there was the withdrawal of hanging for treason, put forward by Lord Archer of Sandwell, a labor peer (not to be confused with Jeffrey Archer).\nJust for the record, why would somebody be so determined to repeal hanging for treason so quickly when they entered office? In your research, I would encourage you to actually look up what is considered treason in this country. You may find it quite interesting.\nNow, back to the haters. In order for you to express your opinion more directly, I have taken the time to create an email especially for you. It is as follows:\nEmail: insults@antonyantoniou.com\nFeel free to do your best, and I will always:\n1. Take it on board.\n2. Decipher what you have to say.\n3. Reflect on it.\n4. Respond politely.\nHopefully, you can learn by my example.\nAs for everybody else, it is clear that people are upset by what is happening, and many of you may resort to considering illegal immigrants to be separate, deceitful, premeditated criminal oxygen thieves. Far be it from me to say anything like that online – perish the thought.\nMay I make it clear, once again for clarity, that this has nothing to do with race, creed, color, faith, or any of that? So please stop using that argument.\nOn the contrary, I am concerned that the fragile and effective integration of everyone who is in the UK, which could so easily be disrupted, is not subjected to that by people who come here to cause a problem. Whatever your background, if you are here, I would urge you to feel as strongly about this as I do.\nBecause, in many of the comments, the most common one is:\n“Well, you look like you’re an immigrant, so I’m confused. Why don’t you want immigrants?”\nIf you are under some illusion that because my parents were immigrants, that would mean that I somehow do not care about the UK, then I’m afraid you are wrong.\nThis has nothing to do with race. It is about the fact that I am grateful to be in this country, and I love this country. I want to see democracy restored in this country far more than many of these wishy-washy woke people who are determined to undermine this country every step of the way.\nI hope that this will enlighten you a little bit.\nAs I said, feel free to agree or disagree. I’d rather you hurl your insults at me than each other.\nI’m not suggesting that we all become the best of friends and meet in Trafalgar Square for a group hug or anything of that nature. In fact, on the contrary, I absolutely love our inherent Britishness of quiet contempt for each other, manifested in the occasional sarcastic comment over tea and a slice of Victoria sponge.\nSo feel free to email me, make your argument, or even better, join me in a live video, either online or face to face. I’d be happy to hear what you have to say, provided that you are willing to hear what I have to say.",

Ayia Napa and Cyprus in general had been transformed into “an open-air club”, Karousos added.\nThe 12 suspects covered their faces with their tee-shirts as they arrived at the courthouse in Paralimni on Thursday morning amid a media frenzy. Several highly-emotional parents and relatives of the 12 who had flown over from Israel were also gathered outside the court.\nDefence lawyers asked the court for the hearing to be held behind closed doors as one of the suspects was a minor, aged 16.\nReports said that two of the 12 suspects confessed to having sexual intercourse with the 19-year-old, while an unspecified number recorded the incident on their mobile phones. Other reports said three of the suspects admitted to having sex with the girl. Police would not confirm the particulars.\nSome of the suspects claim they were not even in the room.\nThree of the suspects were brought to court separately from the others. The other nine arrived about an hour later in a police vehicle. Those who allegedly admitted to having sex with the girl reportedly told police it was consensual.\nBoth the suspects and the alleged victim were medically examined by a state pathologist. Israeli media outlets, which are in contact with the suspects’ families who were allowed into the closed-door hearing said that documents presented to the court by the prosecution included a medical report which said the victim had scratches on her lower limbs.\nIn her report filed to police on Wednesday morning, the 19-year-old told police that she initially agreed to meet up with one of the Israeli suspects, with whom she had met three days before and had sexual intercourse with several times at his hotel room. But after a party on Tuesday night, suddenly 11 more men showed up.\nShe said some proceeded to rape her while others laughed and recorded the incident on their mobile phones as she screamed. Reports said the 19-year-old exited the hotel screaming that she had just been raped, after which some young British men who were in the area tracked down and beat up some of the suspects, they added.\nOther reports said one of the 12 suspects claimed he was assaulted by other tourists, while another claimed he was subsequently beaten by police.\n“The police hit us, they broke our noses, and the girl is lying”, the teens’ lawyers told the Jerusalem Post. “Help us, get us out of here, you’ll see we’re right and that we’re innocent.”\nBut a medical examiner who examined all 12 Israeli suspects found no evidence of battery on them. Also, police spokesman Christos Andreou said none of the suspects has filed a complaint. The Cyprus Mail has learned that, up until Thursday evening, the suspects had not been deposed by police. The delay, it’s understood, has to do with the need to have a lawyer present as well as interpreters.\nIn addition, and contrary to local media reports, it’s understood that to date no Israeli lawyers have flown in to represent the suspects. The suspects are being represented by local lawyers appointed by the state. Police said that the 19-year-old girl has been staying in Cyprus for some time, as she had initially come to holiday on the island before finding a job in Ayia Napa.\nRegarding the 12 suspects, most of them were on vacation pending the start of their military service, while the minor was in Cyprus accompanied by his parents. Police are waiting for DNA results to bring further details to light. Security footage from the hotel where both the 19-year-old and the 12 suspects were staying, as well as from neighbouring shops and buildings, are also expected.\nIsraeli embassy official Yossef Wurmbrand said the embassy would keep in contact with the suspects and their families until the case was closed, and said it would not be intervening in the police work. Meanwhile, the director-general of the ministry of foreign affairs of Israel Yuval Rotem held bilateral talks in Nicosia on Thursday, though it has not been reported whether the incident was raised during the discussion.\nCOMMENT\nEven though there appears to be some disturbing surroundings to this case, we obviously do not know t he full story at this point, but even so, this must raise some serious questions, for the Police and for the resort of Ayia Napa.\nIn recent years, Ayia Napa has become one the leading 18-30 destinations in the mediterranean, but with this popularity, comes responsibility, obligation and the need to create awareness.\nThis incident has highlighted the dangers of alcohol, combined with a party atmosphere and an institutional lack of respect for the legal and moral meaning of consent\nAyia Napa is now under the microscope of the world’s media, therefore there is a serious need for drastic measures, not only to reassure female tourists, but also to so everything possible to make it clear that Cyprus has a policy of ZERO TOLERANCE for non consensual sex.",

This development comes as a significant blow to homeowners who had been eagerly anticipating interest rate reductions throughout the year. Initial forecasts of four potential rate cuts have now been drastically reduced to just one possible decrease for the entire year.\nFinancial experts are pointing to decisions made in the Autumn budget, particularly the increased tax burden on businesses, as key factors contributing to stunted economic growth and escalating borrowing costs. Adding to the complexity of the situation, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is currently in China, accompanied by Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, and Nikhil Rathi, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This timing has raised eyebrows across the financial sector, as three of Britain’s most senior financial figures are abroad whilst the pound faces significant pressure.\nThe scale of Britain’s fiscal challenges is becoming increasingly apparent, with government spending reportedly £100 billion more than Conservative projections. Lord Spencer has described the situation as “catastrophic” and publicly criticised Reeves’s decision to proceed with the China trip. The criticism has been echoed across the economic spectrum, from financial analysts to representatives of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).\nDespite mounting pressure, the Chancellor has reinforced her position, standing firmly by her budget decisions through recent media appearances. However, critics argue that this stance, combined with her absence during a crucial economic period, projects an image of avoidance rather than leadership. Many suggest that a more appropriate response would have been to address the British public directly through television appearances or newspaper columns to explain her economic strategy before departing for China.\nThe situation in the bond markets is particularly concerning, with yields reaching their highest levels since 1998. Contrary to typical economic patterns, these elevated borrowing costs have not strengthened the currency. Instead, the pound continues to weaken, suggesting that investors are losing confidence in sterling and increasingly moving their capital into safe-haven assets such as gold.\nThe implications for government finances are severe, with debt interest payments now exceeding £100 billion annually. This means that approximately one pound in every four of government spending is being directed towards servicing debt rather than funding public services. The government’s position that they haven’t increased taxes on working people has been met with scepticism, as various indirect tax measures impact different sectors of society.\nThe opposition’s response in Parliament, delivered by Darren Jones, has been criticised for displaying a dismissive attitude towards these concerns, particularly his assertion that “markets continue to function in an orderly way.” This response has been interpreted by many as indicative of a broader governmental arrogance in the face of mounting economic challenges.\nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson has entered the debate with characteristic flair, suggesting it’s time for “Rachel from accounts” to receive her P45, adding a political dimension to the economic crisis. This intervention raises questions about potential leadership changes within the Shadow Treasury team, though critics note that finding a suitable replacement for Reeves would be challenging, particularly given the need to potentially reverse some of the recent budget announcements.\nThe current economic situation has also shifted the political narrative, making it increasingly difficult for Labour to attribute all economic challenges to the previous 14 years of Conservative governance. The immediate impact of recent policy decisions has created a distinct set of economic pressures that require urgent attention and potentially significant policy revisions.",

The quit level amounted to 3% of the entire US work force and jumped 37% from a year earlier.\nSome of the biggest losses were in lodging and food services, which saw 920,000 workers walk away, and retail trade, with 686,000 defections. Hospitals and other healthcare employers were also hit hard, losing 598,000 workers, the report showed.\nEmployment separations were largely a one-way street, as more than three workers quit for every one that was discharged. Employers were apparently reluctant to fire workers amid the tight labor market, as November layoffs and other discharges totaled 1.37 million, down 36% from a year earlier.\nWorkers are quitting in droves amid government benefits and greater opportunities to job-hop as rival employers dangle higher wages and signing bonuses. In other cases, the pandemic has caused people to rethink their work and family lives.\nEmployers had 10.6 million jobs to fill in November and managed to hire nearly 6.7 million people, BLS said. The number of available jobs was up 56% from a year earlier and was close to the peak of 11.1 million reached in July. Although businesses had far more vacant jobs to fill, the number of hires rose just 11% from a year earlier. While employers filled 89% of available jobs in the same month of 2020, the rate dropped to 63% last November.\nThe high number of available jobs apparently reflects turnover more than economic growth. Just 210,000 jobs were added in November, the BLS said on Monday, the fewest in nearly a year. Job growth fell far short of expectations, as economists surveyed by Dow Jones had predicted a gain of 573,000. The US jobless rate fell to 4.2%, but it was still higher than the 3.5% level that was hit just before the Covid-19 pandemic.\nCOMMENT:\nThere is much evidence that the Covid lockdown and months of working from home has made people rethink their working life. We can easily become accustomed to a life that revolves around work, but it’s not until people experience a significant change in their routine that they realise just how much the in-doctrine of work dictates their life.\nIn many ways, this is a positive step, because much of the working population has been institutionalised by the corporations, who are demanding more and more on the one hand, then encouraging more and more spending, ensuring that people are slaves to their career. Perhaps it is time for a complete change in social mindset.",

Since Angela Merkel’s controversial decision in 2015 to open Germany’s borders during the Syrian refugee crisis, Europe has grappled with an overwhelming influx of migrants who often lack the desire and means to integrate into their host societies. In Germany, in particular, the strain is palpable, as disillusioned key workers and professionals depart, while millions of less-educated migrants become reliant on state support, posing an economic challenge to the nation.\nFrance has also responded by restricting freedom of movement, a formerly sacrosanct EU principle, by closing its border with Italy to prevent migrants from entering France en route to Great Britain. Consequently, Italy, and to a lesser extent Greece, are on the front lines of this African migrant influx, facing limited resources and support. Every successful arrival of a new group of migrants in mainland Europe via the perilous Mediterranean crossing only encourages countless others to follow suit, perpetuating the crisis. Many experts and policymakers argue that the only viable solution is to halt all migration into the EU and turn away illegal entrants.\nHowever, despite the calls for open borders and humanitarianism, Europe is steadily shifting ideologically toward the right, reminiscent of pre-World War II days. Ironically, the very immigrants and their descendants who sought better lives in Europe may be the ones most vulnerable to this far-right resurgence, potentially embracing racism and xenophobia. The quiet and suppressed anger among ordinary Europeans, spanning the political spectrum, is a warning sign. Unchecked, this anger could manifest violently, leading to abrupt and irrational solutions.\nUrgent action is needed to address this growing migrant challenge. Europe requires principled leaders who prioritize their nations and citizens over pandering to vocal minority groups. This includes celebrities, as well as upper-middle-class professionals and politicians who promote open immigration while residing in privileged and isolated settings. It’s time to confront these individuals as the real traitors among us.\nMoreover, it’s essential to recognize that this migrant influx is not a transient crisis but the onset of an unprecedented wave. If left unchecked, this wave will escalate into an unmanageable flood that will overwhelm Europe’s capacity to respond humanely. Europe must make a difficult decision now or risk descending into civil unrest, extremism, and humanitarian disasters. The choice is narrowing.\nAt its core, this issue revolves around the sustainability of finite resources and Europe’s ability to absorb large numbers of migrants who lack language skills and professional qualifications. Europe’s generous social welfare programs, built since World War II, are admirable but reliant on high taxes and social trust, with limitations. Accepting too many migrants too quickly risks infrastructure decay, erosion of public trust, and the rise of far-right extremists in politics.\nWhile activists argue that Europe has a moral obligation due to its colonial past or failures during the Syrian War, Europe cannot commit civilizational suicide through reckless idealism. It cannot single-handedly solve global problems. Instead, Europe can engage in foreign aid, fair trade, and diplomacy. Europe must strike a balance between humanitarian ideals and pragmatic realities, curbing uncontrolled illegal immigration for social stability. Tough border security and foreign policy decisions are necessary. Delaying action will only exacerbate the crisis. Europe must act soon, in the best interests of both migrants and citizens. The choice belongs to us all.",

Long-standing icons like Bud Light, Ben and Jerry’s, and Target have experienced financial and reputational turbulence as they embraced what some might call the “woke” movement. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the meteoric falls of these brands and ask whether they can ever regain the trust of their loyal customer base.\nThe Rise of DEI and Corporate America\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have become major buzzwords in Corporate America. DEI management is currently the second-fastest-growing job category on LinkedIn, and major businesses are under pressure to enhance their reputation as desirable employers in an increasingly competitive marketplace. But do these companies genuinely care about their employees’ well-being, or is this just an expensive form of virtue signaling?\nAs some argue, it appears that these corporations may not truly prioritize cultural issues but are more interested in looking good on social media and maintaining a high ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score. This perspective raises questions about whether they are genuinely committed to their customers or more focused on appeasing other businesses.\nThe Bud Light Debacle\nOne of the most high-profile casualties of the woke movement has been Bud Light. The iconic beer brand suffered a significant blow when transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney led a campaign that disrupted the market share of the beloved beer. Bud Light, once America’s favorite beer, lost its title after two decades, with Mexican lager Modelo Especial claiming the top spot. The backlash stemmed from a social media post by Dylan Mulvaney, suggesting that the company had alienated its core audience – the frat guys who traditionally drank Bud Light.\nBud Light’s troubles deepened as its parent company reportedly lost $27 billion in market value due to its attempts to promote transgender ideology. Even the ad agency responsible for the campaign faced an uncertain future.\nThe Target Backlash\nTarget, the department store giant, also faced financial and reputational consequences for its actions during Pride Month. The company’s decision to roll out a pride collection featuring LGBTQ-friendly clothing for children led to a boycott that resulted in a $9 billion loss in market value. The customer pushback against such a politically charged move was evident, showing that companies might need to reconsider their approach to activism.\nBen and Jerry’s Hypocrisy\nBen and Jerry’s, known for its progressive stance, faced backlash after demanding reparations through a 4th of July tweet. While they advocated returning land to indigenous people, it was revealed that they hadn’t done the same for the Native American nation that originally controlled the land where their headquarters is located.\nDisney’s Woke Woes\nEven entertainment behemoth Disney faced a subscriber exodus, losing 2.4 million subscribers after embracing woke content. Their push for inclusion, including featuring a non-binary character in a film, resulted in the lowest opening weekend revenue in the company’s history.\nStarbucks Struggles\nStarbucks, too, found itself in the crosshairs after dedicating an entire TV commercial to transgender issues. While they initially faced backlash for not allowing employees to decorate their workplaces for Pride Month, the company eventually found itself in a position where its politics and coffee mix didn’t bode well with consumers.\nConsumer Power and Corporate Change\nDespite the resistance from some CEOs and marketing departments, the consumer pushback against overtly woke agendas has started to show results. Disney’s Chief Diversity Officer resigned, and they had to tone down their agenda. Target stock plummeted, and Starbucks faced strikes over Pride merchandise removal.\nConclusion\nIn this era of increased corporate activism, it’s becoming clear that businesses that prioritize preaching over serving their customers are at risk of suffering severe consequences. The days when woke corporations were shielded by Wall Street may be numbered as even large asset managers like BlackRock begin to reassess their positions. The lesson for legacy brands is clear: striking a balance between corporate activism and serving the customer is essential to avoid a turbulent fall from grace.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-channel-crossings-conundrum-unveiling-the-ongoing-migration-challenge/content_453.html": "The Channel Crossings Conundrum – Unveiling the Ongoing Migration Challenge\nIntroduction: The Channel Crossings Saga\nIn an era marked by global shifts and political transformations, the intricate issue of immigration has taken center stage in numerous nations, with the United Kingdom finding itself at the epicenter of the debate. Among the myriad aspects of this issue, one stands out prominently: the perilous journeys of migrants attempting to cross the English Channel. Recent revelations have thrust this challenge into the spotlight, prompting a deeper examination of the multifaceted nature of irregular migration under the leadership of Prime Minister Richie Sunax.\nThe Evolution of a Crisis: A Recap of the Numbers\nReflecting on the past week, it’s striking to consider that an astonishing one hundred thousand individuals have successfully traversed the English Channel over the last five years. This statistic alone paints a vivid picture of the extent of the issue at hand. However, the narrative takes an intriguing twist as fresh data emerges, indicating a significant escalation in these cross-channel journeys during Prime Minister Richie Sunax’s tenure.\nSunax’s Stewardship and the Escalation in Numbers\nTaking the reins in late October of the preceding year, Prime Minister Sunax stepped into a role marked by a surge in channel crossings. A staggering revelation now surfaces, with over 25,000 migrants having made their way across the channel since his assumption of office. This rising tide of human movement showcases the scale of the challenge he faces, propelling irregular migration to the forefront of his policy agenda.\nSetting Targets and Facing Realities: The Challenge of Stopping the Boats\nAmid high expectations, Prime Minister Sunax articulated a set of five ambitious objectives for the year, one of which aimed to quell the inflow of migrants arriving on British shores via boats. However, the passage of time has illuminated the intricate difficulties of turning this objective into a reality. The challenge is no longer merely a statistic; it’s a complex puzzle demanding immediate attention and pragmatic solutions.\nThe Legal Labyrinth: Unpacking the Rwanda Angle\nDelving deeper into the issue, it becomes evident that the challenge extends beyond the migrants’ dangerous voyages. The proposed Rwanda angle, centered around processing migrants in Rwanda, remains ensnared in legal complexities. A timeline stretching another four months underscores the intricate interplay between judicial processes, immigration policies, and the broader conundrum of irregular migration.\nThe Geography Factor: The Complexity of Border Security\nA fundamental aspect of the challenge lies in the geographical layout of the southern coast of the United Kingdom. The extensive coastline presents multiple entry points, complicating efforts to secure the border effectively. Collaborative initiatives with France, accompanied by substantial financial investments, were aimed at bolstering joint patrolling and interception endeavors. Yet, recent reports reveal that these efforts may not have yielded the desired results, casting doubts on the effectiveness of the partnership.\nCurrent Figures and the Incessant Surge\nPresent-day figures command attention, with an official count of 24,972 migrants recorded, reflecting an overnight increase of 112. Adding weight to the matter, a recent report highlights the docking of yet another boat in Dover Port, carrying an estimated 28 migrants. These numbers underscore the urgency and complexity of the situation, presenting Prime Minister Sunax with an increasingly challenging landscape.\nThe Elusive Resolution: Beyond Stopping the Boats\nMoving forward, it’s apparent that the issue extends far beyond halting boat arrivals. What’s at stake is not a simple numerical target but a comprehensive reevaluation of immigration policies, collaborative strategies, and legal avenues. While Prime Minister Sunax has made stopping the boats a priority, the absence of a concrete timeline underscores the intricacies involved in achieving this objective.\nLooking to the Horizon: Uncertainties and Implications\nAs the horizon beckons, the issue of irregular migration remains a key facet of the political discourse, particularly as a potential election looms on the horizon next year. The narrative surrounding channel crossings and immigration policy is far from complete. It calls for a holistic, strategic approach that addresses the root causes, navigates legal complexities, and fosters cross-border collaborations to ensure a sustainable resolution.\nConclusion: The Journey Ahead\nIn the face of an ever-evolving global landscape, the challenge of irregular migration persists as a poignant reminder of the complexities inherent in managing migration flows. The saga of channel crossings under Prime Minister Sunax’s leadership symbolizes the ongoing effort required to tackle this intricate issue. As the narrative unfolds, the nation watches with a mixture of hope and concern, eager to witness how policies, collaboration, and innovation shape the journey ahead.",

Kevin Ressikan, who had been teaching maths for 18 years, shared his reflections on the tribunal’s decision, expressing his devastation and rejecting the claims of harassment and discrimination against the student.\nThe incident in question occurred at New College Swindon, where Ressikan had been employed for just over a year. It centered around a conversation he had with a transgender student, referred to as “Student A,” who was considering entering a girls’ maths competition. Ressikan recounted the exchange, stating that he had encouraged the student to participate and explained the risks associated with transitioning as best he could.\n“She went away and said she’d think about it, and then she entered the girls’ competition,” Ressikan said. “So I thought, well, she had thought about it, maybe she concluded that she was a girl after all and didn’t need to be avoid.”\nHowever, the situation took a turn in January when another student, identified as “Student B,” stayed behind after class and demanded that Ressikan refer to Student A using male pronouns. Ressikan attempted to explain his reasoning for believing that transitioning was a “bad idea,” but this conversation, along with an incident where he inadvertently wrote Student A’s previous name on a whiteboard, became pivotal moments in the tribunal’s decision.\n“I didn’t do it deliberately to make a point,” Ressikan clarified about the whiteboard incident. “It’s just I’m writing girls’ names to go up in a girls’ maths competition.”\nPrior to the tribunal, Ressikan had raised a safeguarding concern regarding the college’s policy of not informing parents about a student’s decision to socially transition. He expressed concerns about the lack of parental consent, the potential for self-medication with cross-sex hormones, and the student’s ability to make an informed decision.\n“The college response was, ‘Our policy is not to tell parents,'” Ressikan said. “They couldn’t answer question two, couldn’t answer question three. They gave me no guidance at all – zero. So I was basically supposed to go into the class and make up my own rules as to what I was supposed to do.”\nRessikan’s stance was further solidified by the Kira Bell case, which highlighted the experimental nature of transitioning and the lack of scientific evidence behind it. He maintained that the practice is “a non-evidence-based ideological precedent which has caused and can cause serious harm.”\nThe consequences of Ressikan’s actions have been severe. The college referred him to the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), which placed him on the children’s barred list, effectively preventing him from teaching or even driving a van for a delivery company, as many require DBS clearance.\nDespite the professional and personal toll, Ressikan remains steadfast in his convictions. When asked if he regrets his decision, he responded without hesitation: “No, don’t regret this at all. I would do the same thing. I would put safeguarding first.”\nRessikan’s stance highlights the ongoing debate surrounding transgender rights, parental involvement, and the role of educators in navigating these complex issues. While some applaud his commitment to safeguarding and his adherence to his principles, others argue that his actions were discriminatory and harmful to the transgender student’s well-being.\nThe case has reignited discussions about the balance between respecting an individual’s gender identity and addressing legitimate concerns regarding the potential risks and long-term implications of transitioning, particularly for minors. It also raises questions about the extent to which schools and institutions should involve parents in such decisions and the level of guidance and support provided to educators navigating these sensitive situations.\nAs the debate continues, Ressikan’s dismissal serves as a cautionary tale for teachers and a reminder of the potential consequences of challenging institutional policies, even when motivated by a desire to prioritize student safety and well-being.\nThe case also underscores the broader societal conversations surrounding transgender rights, highlighting the need for open and respectful dialogue, as well as clear guidelines and protocols for educational institutions to ensure the protection and support of all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression.\nSummary\n• Kevin Ressikan, a maths teacher with 18 years of experience, was fired from New College Swindon for refusing to use a transgender student’s preferred pronouns\n• He had encouraged the transgender student (“Student A”) to enter a girls’ maths competition, but later raised safeguarding concerns about the college’s policy of not informing parents about students socially transitioning\n• A second student (“Student B”) demanded Ressikan refer to Student A using male pronouns, which he refused to do\n• Ressikan inadvertently wrote Student A’s previous name on a whiteboard when listing girls for the maths competition\n• He cited the Kira Bell case, arguing that transitioning is an “experimental” treatment lacking scientific evidence and can cause harm\n• Ressikan was referred to the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and placed on the children’s barred list, preventing him from teaching again\n• Despite the severe professional consequences, he stands by his actions, stating he would “do the same thing” and “put safeguarding first”\n• The case has reignited debates around transgender rights, parental involvement, risks of transitioning for minors, and the guidance/support provided to educators",

It is located in the Nicosia District and the agricultural centre of the “Solea” region located about 50 km south-west of Nicosia and 30 km from mount Troodos.\nGeography and climate\nEvrychou is located in Nicosia District and it is the agricultural centre of the “Solea” region. It is located about 50 km south-west of Nicosia and 30 km from mount Troodos. The village is built at the east bank of the Karkotis (or Klarios) River, at an average altitude of 440 metres. The climate of the region is typically Mediterranean and so the cultivations found around the village vary from fruit-bearing trees (mainly apple, pear, plum, apricot, and peach trees) to citrus-trees, almond and olive trees. There are also cultivations of vines, vegetables and cereals.\nOrigins\nThere are several interpretations regarding the village’s name. The most prevalent reports that the village got its name because of being the only village in the region that has the largest range: “Evrys Chous”, which in ancient Greek means “Large area / land”. A second interpretation mentions that, according to tradition, the name was given to the village by immigrants from other regions, which found here plenty and fertile land (“Ev Chous”, meaning Good land).

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_channel-migrants-quietly-granted-right-to-work/content_147.html": "Channel Migrants Quietly Granted Right to Work\nThe Home Office has recently and quietly granted asylum seekers who crossed the English Channel in small boats the right to work in certain sectors struggling with acute staff shortages. This controversial policy decision is likely to have profound implications as the UK grapples with record numbers of migrant channel crossings.\nScheme Allows Migrants to Work After a Year of Unresolved Cases\nAccording to data obtained under Freedom of Information laws, nearly 16,000 migrants were allowed to work in the past year alone under the Home Office scheme. The programme stipulates that asylum seekers can apply for work permits if their applications remain unresolved for over 12 months.\nOnce approved, these migrants are then able to seek employment in designated shortage occupations like social care, construction, agriculture and food processing. The policy means new arrivals could be working in some of Britain’s most vital industries within a year of setting foot on UK shores.\nThe Pay Rate and Incentives Making Work an Attractive Option\nMigrants who secure work permits under the scheme are paid 80% of the standard market rate within their occupation. They must forfeit the usual £49 weekly state allowance provided to asylum seekers if earning above that threshold. However, migrants can negotiate with the Home Office to remain in government-subsidised housing if they contribute towards accommodation costs.\nWith the promise of employment and the potential to keep some living expenses covered, taking up work is an attractive option for many migrants stuck in limbo as their cases go unresolved. Over 15,000 permits were issued in 2022 alone, representing nearly a third of the 51,000 asylum applicants who had already been waiting over a year for a decision.\nRising Backlogs and Channel Crossings Drive Increase in Work Permits\nThe massive year-on-year increase in work permits has occurred alongside two key trends – a 10-fold rise in the backlog of unresolved asylum cases and record numbers of migrant channel crossing attempts. With both these drivers expected to continue propelling permit application numbers even higher, critics argue the policy risks acting as an uncontrolled pull factor.\nThere are concerns that smugglers could use the prospect of securing legal work and subsidised housing within 12 months to entice more migrants to risk the perilous journey across the world’s busiest shipping lane.\nAs Ministers Eye Economic Benefits, Critics Warn of Threat to Deterrence Efforts\nSome government ministers and advisers have suggested bringing policy even more in line with other European countries by allowing asylum seekers to work after just 6 months of waiting. They argue earlier work rights for new arrivals could boost economic growth and tax revenues.\nHowever, critics like Nigel Farage warn that such measures fatally undermine the government’s attempts to deter illegal migration through tough rhetoric and controversial offshoring schemes. With the Rwanda deportation policy facing ongoing legal challenges, the ability to advertise jobs, housing and benefits could act as an incentive that encourages more migrants to make the dangerous Channel crossing.\nComplex Balancing Act for Sunak Between Deterrence and Practical Policy\nAs he continues pushing legislation to get Rwanda deportation flights off the ground, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces criticism that concessions like work permits represent mixed messaging that signals Britain remains an attractive destination for illegal migration.\nHowever, the government insists there is no evidence formally linking the scheme to increased small boat crossings. Officials also highlight steps taken to cut unresolved caseloads and tighten the policy’s scope to shortage occupations.\nNavigating these issues requires complex trade-offs between politically tough deterrence posturing and more practical policies tackling staff shortages that ultimately allow new arrivals to integrate. For Sunak, confronting the unrelenting tide of Channel migrants will demand walking this fine line as pressure mounts to show concrete results.",

It’s CRIMINAL ….\nCOMMENT\nCyprus is no place to be if you are a man, caught up in a legal system where women can do no wrong, the blatant contempt for men within the legal system in Cyprus has already caused a massive shift in social behaviour, with more and more men, taking a back seat in life and not starting a family. I have personally been a victim of the failed legal system in Cyprus and the arrogance of Judges who decide to play God when they are actually capitulating to the ubiquitous misandry of the legal system as a whole. Sadly, this is little more than an extension of the blatant degradation and legal subjugation of men, that has spread throughout Europe in the last few decades.\nWhen I filed for my divorce, I went above and beyond to do the best by my child as well as my ex-wife, but it seems that from a legal perspective, as well as a social perspective, men in Cyprus are considered to be little more than Sperm donors and providers with bottomless pockets. As time went by, it became clearly obvious, that no matter how bad my ex-wife was as a mother, the Social Services, the Law as well as social pressure was always on her side, even when there was a need for my daughter to be taken in to care.\nMy ex-wife even declared that she did not want her, so I arranged for her to come to live with me in the UK, but on her arrival, I told my ex-wife that I would no longer be paying her child support as my daughter was now in my care, whereby she immediately applied through the courts (all paid by the Government) and I had to bear the cost and the suffering of fighting to protect my child in the High Court of London. In the end, the judge ordered her to be returned and I had to hand her over kicking and screaming to a court official.\nIt did not last long, Social Services were aware of her terrible situation and the following year, they gave my ex-wife an ultimatum, to either send my daughter to me, or they would take her in to care, so she agreed, but not before having me arrested like a common criminal for non-payment of child support, even for the period that my daughter was with me. The sad thing was that the damage was already done, even though I spent the next decade raising my daughter alone, her mother’s influence continues to poison her mind and the law is behind her.\n“Is one small victory for individual women in danger of being detrimental to womankind as a whole?”\nHaving lived back in Cyprus since she was 18 at her request, my ex-wife continued to poison my daughter’s mind, to demand more and more from me, because in Cyprus, being a father is all about paying, eventually within the last year, my ex-wife has conspired with my daughter and I am fighting 4 different cases through the courts, none of them justified, 2 have been thrown out already, the other 2 will also amount to nothing, but I have once again been left with massive legal costs, because the law despises men.\nI consider the current climate to hold men in such contempt, that I understand why men increasingly shy away from marriage and quite justifiably so.

Jones revealed that specialised “challenge panels”, comprising external specialists, are being established across all government departments to provide “fresh perspective on whether every penny spent is necessary or not”.\nThe Prime Minister is scheduled to unveil a new governmental strategy focusing on Artificial Intelligence on Monday, aimed at stimulating economic growth by creating an environment conducive to increased AI sector investment in Britain.\nThese developments emerge as Ms Reeves faces intensifying economic challenges ahead of the forthcoming Spending Review, coupled with growing internal party scrutiny of her taxation and public spending policies.\nThe situation reached a critical point on Saturday evening, as Labour MPs disclosed that backing for the Chancellor was “evaporating” even amongst her erstwhile supporters, with some privately advocating for her resignation. This crisis follows a week during which the Treasury was compelled to intervene in financial markets after indicators suggested that escalating debt costs had eliminated Ms Reeves’s fiscal headroom, potentially breaching her self-imposed financial regulations.\nThe economic turbulence was precipitated by a dramatic sell-off in the global government debt market, propelling Britain’s long-term borrowing costs to levels not witnessed since 1998. The fiscal impact has been severe, with one quarter of the £40billion in tax increases implemented by Ms Reeves in autumn being consumed by rising borrowing costs, as international investors express uncertainty regarding the scale of government debt.\nSpeaking from Beijing on Saturday, the Chancellor emphasised the importance of strengthening ties with China for economic growth. However, her diplomatic mission drew criticism from Conservative opponents, who argued she should have remained in Britain to “fix this mess of her own making”.\nInternal party criticism has grown increasingly vocal. A Labour MP, speaking on condition of anonymity, shared with The Telegraph: “The Government’s entire strategy hinges on growth. However, there is a profound lack of confidence. Economic growth requires favourable energy prices, market confidence, and infrastructure investment—yet her policies have achieved precisely the opposite.”\nThe source continued, noting that “support for her has completely dissipated—even initial supporters are now expressing doubts” and suggested that there “simply isn’t a viable path forward with her at the helm”.\nThe MP further revealed that Reeves’ “hopeless” performance has become “the primary, if not secondary, topic of conversation whenever MPs gather for refreshments or encounter one another in Parliamentary corridors”.\nAnother Labour parliamentarian characterised her China visit as indicative of “desperation”, suggesting it reflects a dearth of options for stimulating British economic growth. They expressed grave concerns about the sustainability of current policies, stating: “This approach appears untenable even in the short term, let alone for an extended period. The entire growth narrative is now confronting harsh economic realities”.\nLabour MPs highlighted several controversial Treasury decisions, including reductions in universal winter fuel payments, the introduction of what has been termed the “family farm tax”, and the decision not to compensate the Waspi women.\nA Labour insider observed: “Initially, criticism focused on other ministers, but there’s growing recognition that ultimate responsibility rests with her. The pressure she faces would be significantly reduced if not for the series of political missteps—it appears to be an endless succession of errors.”\nIn his Sunday Telegraph contribution, Mr Jones emphasised: “In our communications with Cabinet colleagues, we have been unequivocal about the inherited challenges and current fiscal landscape. Standard operational procedures cannot suffice when reviewing departmental budgets for upcoming years. Furthermore, regarding waste reduction, all options remain under consideration.”\nHe further outlined the government’s commitment to fiscal responsibility: “We are committed to conducting an exhaustive examination of public sector waste. Departments have received clear directives to identify savings and efficiencies across their budgets while ensuring optimal utilisation of taxpayer resources.”\nJones concluded by highlighting that Britain has “already endured prolonged periods of public sector inefficiency” resulting in the loss of billions in public funds, emphasising the urgent need for reform and careful stewardship of public resources.\nSummary\nThe situation facing Chancellor Rachel Reeves represents a critical juncture for both her leadership and Labour’s economic strategy. Her announcement of a “war on waste” comes at a particularly challenging time, characterised by multiple converging pressures:\nThe economic challenges are substantial: rising borrowing costs have consumed a quarter of her £40 billion autumn tax rises, market confidence appears to be wavering, and her fiscal headroom has been severely compromised. This has forced the Treasury into market intervention and raised questions about the viability of her fiscal rules.\nWithin Labour, support for the Chancellor appears to be crumbling. Even previously loyal supporters are now expressing serious doubts about her leadership, with some privately calling for her resignation. The criticism focuses not just on economic management but on a series of what MPs view as political missteps, including controversial decisions on winter fuel payments and the “family farm tax”.\nThe government’s response, spearheaded by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, centres on a comprehensive efficiency drive across all departments, including the establishment of “challenge panels” and increased private sector collaboration. However, this approach is viewed by some critics as insufficient to address the fundamental economic challenges facing the nation.\nThe timing of her China visit, while potentially important for long-term economic growth, has been criticised as demonstrating poor judgment given the domestic financial challenges. This has added to the growing sense among some Labour MPs that there is no viable path forward with Reeves as Chancellor.\nThis confluence of events suggests a critical period ahead for both Reeves and Labour’s economic strategy, with significant implications for the party’s broader political prospects and approach to public finance management.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-ulez-must-be-stopped-at-all-costs/content_15.html": "Why ULEZ must be stopped at all costs\nThe Expansion of EULEZ: A Concern for Democracy and Clean Air\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon, everyone! I want to take a moment to address a pressing matter that has been on my mind. Yesterday marked a significant development—the expansion of the controversial EULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zone) to encompass even the M25 region. As we all know, EULEZ has been a subject of intense debate, sparking discussions about its motives, consequences, and implications for our society. In this post, I will share my thoughts on this expansion, exploring both the underlying issues and potential solutions.\nA Controversial Move\nThe recent expansion of EULEZ has raised numerous concerns and ignited passionate debates. While it’s clear that air quality and sustainability are crucial, the way EULEZ has been implemented and structured leaves room for scepticism. The concept of a low emission zone sounds promising, but the reality appears to be far more complex.\nThe Need for Comprehensive Change\nOne of the most significant criticisms of EULEZ lies in its structure. If this initiative genuinely aimed to create cleaner air and a healthier environment, its framework would likely be different. Instead, it seems to disproportionately affect the economically disadvantaged, while those with financial means can continue to pollute without restraint. Even vehicles touted as “compliant” often emit pollutants well beyond what older, non-compliant vehicles produce.\nA Different Approach\nIf the goal were to genuinely improve air quality and encourage cleaner transportation, an alternative structure might be more effective. For instance, banning vehicles emitting more than a certain threshold of emissions, like 300 grams, would be a logical step. Gradually reducing emission limits over a period of time could ensure a smoother transition, allowing both individuals and manufacturers to adapt.\nBeyond Clean Air: An Agenda of Control\nIt’s hard to ignore the suspicion that this initiative is about more than just clean air. The expansion of EULEZ and similar developments raise concerns about control and the potential erosion of personal freedoms. As we move forward, we need to consider the larger picture—how these changes fit into a broader trend toward increased control and surveillance.\nUniting Beyond Partisan Lines\nOne of the most concerning aspects of these developments is their ability to divide us along political lines. Our society has become increasingly polarized, with every issue seen through the lens of party affiliation. It’s vital that we rise above this divide and focus on the core issues at hand. This isn’t a matter of left or right; it’s about our collective future.\nTaking Action for Democracy\nAlthough I’m not based in London, I am strongly against the expansion of EULEZ and similar initiatives across the country. To truly address this issue, we must engage in the democratic process. In the upcoming elections, I intend to stand as an independent candidate. While the odds may be against me, I believe that by doing so, I can inspire others to do the same.\nA Call for Unity\nThe power of independent voices is undeniable. It’s not about the particular political stance you hold, but about breaking the stranglehold of established parties and regaining genuine representation. Regardless of where you stand politically, it’s essential to support independent candidates who genuinely prioritize the interests of the people.\nThe Looming Threat of Euro 7\nAs we contemplate the current situation, it’s crucial to also look to the future. The introduction of Euro 7, set to be implemented in 2025, could have profound implications for vehicle compliance. The inclusion of hybrid and EV requirements, along with aspects such as battery recyclability, poses challenges that many are unaware of. It’s imperative that we educate ourselves about these changes and their potential consequences.\nWhat is Euro 7?\nComing Soon: Euro 7 Emissions Standards for Cars\nIn the not-so-distant future, precisely in July 2025, an essential transformation will take place in the automotive world: the introduction of Euro 7 emissions standards. Euro 7 represents a comprehensive set of regulations that establish a strict upper limit on emissions produced by new cars and vehicles sold within Europe and the UK. These regulations hold a pivotal role, ensuring that newly manufactured cars align with stringent pollution benchmarks.\nThe Driving Force Behind Euro Emissions Standards\nAt the heart of the Euro emissions standards lies a crucial objective: to progressively curtail the air pollution stemming from vehicles. This pollution significantly contributes to compromised air quality and contributes to the adverse effects of global warming. These standards complement the UK government’s ambitious plan to halt the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by the year 2030, adding another layer of commitment to the battle against vehicular emissions.\nThe Unsettled Horizon of Euro 7\nThe specifics of Euro 7 emissions standards have not yet been definitively established. Automotive manufacturers and European legislators find themselves embroiled in debates concerning permissible emission levels and the methodology for implementing these standards. Though initial proposals have been unveiled, they have proven to be somewhat less rigorous than what the automobile industry initially anticipated. These propositions are currently awaiting the seal of approval from the European Parliament.\nA Seamless Transition Post-Brexit\nWhile the UK has departed from the European Union, it remains steadfast in its commitment to the established vehicle emissions framework, which had its origins in the Euro 1 standards of 1992 and progressed to Euro 6 in 2014. Consequently, new cars available for purchase in the UK will be expected to meet the Euro 7 compliance, with only a handful of exceptions.\nA Personal Stake in Euro 7 Standards\nFor the average motorist, the Euro emissions regulations might appear to be of distant relevance. However, their implications are far-reaching, impacting the spectrum of new vehicles available in showrooms and potentially influencing operating costs. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), the voice of car manufacturers in Europe, underscores that while automakers are resolute in their commitment to reducing vehicle emissions, overly stringent Euro 7 standards could amplify consumer costs due to the intricate measures required for emissions reduction.\nThe Economics at Play\nThere exists a significant disparity between manufacturers and lawmakers concerning the financial burden of achieving Euro 7 compliance. A report from 2023 by Frontier Economics estimated manufacturing costs at approximately £1,740 per car and £10,450 per truck or bus, while the European Commission proposed significantly lower estimates of £156 to £390 per car and £2,430 per truck or bus. Regardless of the actual figures, it’s reasonable to anticipate that some portion of these costs will be passed on to consumers. Furthermore, the ACEA predicts an average fuel economy reduction of 3.5%, resulting from the measures required to meet Euro 7, which include additional fuel consumption to warm the car’s catalytic converter during cold starts.\nEuro 7 and Urban Emission Zones\nAnother pivotal reason for individuals to pay heed to Euro 7 emissions standards is their role in classifying cars for Ultra Low Emissions Zones (ULEZ) that are sprouting across the UK. It’s worth noting that, as of now, there are no imminent plans to link the introduction of Euro 7 standards with changes in regulations for London’s ULEZ or other emissions zones in the UK. However, understanding your car’s Euro emissions rating will empower you to determine whether you’re subject to fees for entering a ULEZ or not.\nIn summary, the impending Euro 7 emissions standards herald a new era of vehicular emissions accountability. While their immediate impact might not be apparent to every motorist, these standards hold the potential to reshape the automotive landscape, impacting both consumer choices and financial considerations. Moreover, Euro 7’s role in categorizing vehicles for ULEZ zones makes it a relevant point of consideration for urban commuters. As the automotive industry progresses toward cleaner and more sustainable practices, these standards represent a significant stride toward a greener future on our roads.\nConclusion: Time for Collective Action\nIn conclusion, the expansion of EULEZ is not just about cleaner air. It’s a reflection of broader shifts in our society—shifts towards control, division, and inequality. To counter these changes, we must unite as citizens, regardless of our political leanings, and advocate for transparent, fair, and democratic processes. The power to shape our future lies in our collective action. Let’s work together to ensure that our society remains one where the voices of all are heard, and our rights are preserved.\nThank you for taking the time to read this post.\nWell said Antony, you are absolutely right and you are an inspiration. I sincerely hope that you do inspire more people to stand independently, because that is the only way that we can restore democracy.\nGood luck with your campaign.",

Every country in Europe is beautiful in its own right, each with its own culture, its own language forged over hundreds or thousands of years of history, and each one unique, each one different to the other.\nWhether it’s Spain and the exhilaration of flamenco or Italy and the passion of an opera, a nation steeped in two and a half thousand years of history from Remus and Romulus through to the days when Rome fell to the vandals, where people withdrew to marshlands in the north Adriatic that rose to be Venice. The art, the culture, the food, and one of the most beautiful languages in the world, so Italy does rank as one of my favorites, as you’ve probably gathered.\nThen there’s Greece, again, with its long, long history and philosophy and democracy that has given so much to the world, a country that endured three and a half centuries of occupation and retained its identity. Yet, two or three decades of unhindered immigration, and the entire nation is under threat.\nThen we have the efficiency and attention to detail of Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, the pride and the belligerence and the culture of France, whose string of islands around the world actually make it one of the fifth largest EEZs on the planet. And with the exception of somewhere in Siberia, I believe you cannot go anywhere on the planet without being more than an hour or two from French soil. How wonderful is that?\nThe UK, you know my thoughts, but then there’s Wales and there’s Scotland, one of the most beautiful places in the world where around every corner there’s a sight more breathtaking than the last.\nThen we have Ireland, our closest and possibly dearest neighbor, a nation that suffered at the hands of the British Empire in the 19th century, so much so that the population of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland put together is one or two million less today than it was in 1840, so much was the diaspora and the death from what they have suffered. And yet, they rose, they became the Celtic Tiger as we all know. But sadly, when a nation is confined by the restrictions of being a member of the Euro, when their economy is beginning to overheat, they are powerless to turn the temperature down, and they cannot do anything about their economy spontaneously combusting and causing itself so much damage.\nIt’s very, very sad that our young people have been subjected to so much political indoctrination, cultural shaming, and climate anxiety to the point where they are passive to everything that is happening and almost ready, willing, and able to just capitulate to what is happening to their country. Our young people today are one of the most educated generations in history, but what we need to do is we need to ignite the passion in their hearts for their country. Not anger, not hate, not anxiety, but a love and a determination to protect their heritage. And this is perhaps where we need to look at not just the fact that they are being educated but how they are being educated.\nAnd on that note, I’ll close with one of my favorite quotes: “An education of the mind without an education of the heart is no education at all.” Thank you very much. Bye-bye for now.”",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_disillusionment-with-mainstream-political-parties-reaches-breaking-point/content_286.html": "Disillusionment with Mainstream Political Parties Reaches Breaking Point\nThe current political landscape in the United Kingdom has reached a critical juncture, where voters have become increasingly disillusioned with the traditional political establishment. The Conservative Party’s protracted period of governance, marked by a series of spectacular failures, has given way to a Labour Party that appears equally incapable of addressing the nation’s fundamental challenges.\nThe Conservative Twilight: A Catalogue of Failures\nThe previous Conservative Government’s tenure was characterised by a remarkable sequence of policy catastrophes and administrative ineptitude. From the infamous mini-budget of 2022 that sent financial markets into a tailspin to the scandalous “partygate” episode that exposed the government’s brazen disregard for pandemic restrictions, the Conservatives managed to erode public trust with remarkable consistency.\nTheir policy promises emerged as nothing more than hollow rhetoric. The NHS, ostensibly a priority, became increasingly inaccessible, with patients facing interminable waiting times and diminishing healthcare resources. Economic promises of growth dissolved into a quagmire of stagnation and rampant inflation. Immigration—a perennial political football—continued to rise to levels that even previous Labour administrations would have found challenging to defend.\nThe rhetoric of “levelling up” proved to be particularly mendacious. While politicians pontificated about regional regeneration, local high streets became ghostly landscapes of boarded-up shops and economic despair. Promises to tackle anti-social behaviour rang hollow as public spaces in numerous towns and cities descended into conditions of neglect and disorder.\nLabour’s Premature Triumphalism\nKeir Starmer’s Labour Party, in its eagerness to differentiate itself from the Conservative shambles, committed a strategic error of significant magnitude. By consistently portraying the previous government as uniquely incompetent, they inadvertently set themselves an almost impossible standard of performance.\nThe simplistic narrative of “change” as a panacea for the nation’s multifaceted challenges was always going to be problematic. Voters, initially receptive to this message, quickly discovered that systemic issues are not resolved through mere political transition.\nThe Fundamental Malaise of Contemporary Politics\nAt the heart of this political dysfunction lies a profound psychological disconnect. Politicians across the spectrum suffer from an endemic condition of intellectual hubris. Each political faction views itself as inherently superior, populated by visionaries, while perceiving their opponents as fundamentally incompetent.\nThis hyper-confident approach has cultivated a perpetual cycle of political disillusionment. By consistently overpromising and dramatically under-delivering, political parties have systematically eroded public trust. The consequence is a growing sentiment of cynicism that threatens the very foundations of representative democracy.\nA Potential Beacon of Hope?\nAmidst this political quagmire, some emerging political figures offer a potentially different approach. Kemi Badenoch represents an intriguing deviation from the established political narrative. Her reluctance to make grandiose promises and her philosophical scepticism towards expansive state intervention might signal a more nuanced approach to governance.\nThe Growing Appetite for Alternative Political Movements\nFocus groups preceding the last general election revealed a profound sentiment of political exhaustion. Many voters viewed their engagement with Labour as a final opportunity for meaningful political transformation. The implicit warning was clear: failure to deliver substantive change would result in a wholesale abandonment of mainstream political structures.\nThe conditions are now ripe for the emergence of alternative political movements. Parties like Reform are well-positioned to capitalise on this widespread disenchantment. The traditional political establishment’s survival depends on a fundamental recalibration of expectations and a genuine commitment to realistic, achievable objectives.\nConclusion: A Critical Moment of Political Reckoning\nThe United Kingdom stands at a critical political crossroads. The traditional mechanisms of political representation are under unprecedented strain. Unless mainstream political parties demonstrate a capacity for genuine self-reflection, humility, and a recognition of the limits of state intervention, they risk becoming increasingly marginalised.\nThe message from the electorate is unambiguous: political parties must cease their cycle of perpetual over-promising and under-delivering. Failure to heed this warning may well precipitate a radical restructuring of the political landscape, with potentially far-reaching consequences for the future of British democracy.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_rumours-of-nigel-farage-rejoining-the-conservatives-create-frenzy-of-speculation/content_68.html": "Rumours of Nigel Farage rejoining the conservatives create frenzy of speculation\n“Should Rishi Sunak Beg Nigel Farage to Join the Tories? Exploring the Possibilities”\nIntroduction\nThe Conservative party conference has left the Tory Right feeling somewhat disappointed. Despite the fervent desire for a more Brexit-focused agenda and a return to traditional conservative values, the tax burden remains high, the small boats crisis continues, and cycling remains legal. However, amid these challenges, there is a glimmer of hope for Rishi Sunak and his party’s base – the prospect of inviting Nigel Farage back into the Tory fold.\nNigel Farage’s Resurgence\nIt’s been three decades since Nigel Farage left the Conservative party to join UKIP, but recent appearances at the party conference suggest he never really left. He even made headlines by singing karaoke with Home Secretary Priti Patel. Farage’s return to the spotlight has raised questions about whether he should be welcomed back into the Conservative party, and this intriguing possibility has garnered attention.\nRishi Sunak’s Openness\nDuring the conference, GB News asked Rishi Sunak if Nigel Farage would be welcome to rejoin the Conservative party. Unlike previous Tory leaders who might have dismissed the idea, Sunak’s response was open-minded. He emphasized that the Conservative party is a “broad church” that welcomes those who share its ideals.\nThe Shift Away from a “Broad Church”\nIn recent years, the Conservative party has shifted away from being a “broad church.” This transformation became evident in 2019 when Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the Tory whip from disenchanted Remainers like Rory Stewart. Contrary to expectations, this move actually revitalized the party’s fortunes, culminating in a landslide victory in the general election. As a result, the party is now compelled to embrace its Brexity side to maintain its appeal.\nThe Perception of Rishi Sunak\nDespite Rishi Sunak’s own vote in favor of Leave, some Tory Leavers question his commitment to Brexit. He often comes across as a stereotypical Remainer: unassuming, technocratic, and lacking in radical ideas. This perception can be detrimental to the party’s image of a strong commitment to Brexit.\nThe Role of Nigel Farage\nNigel Farage, on the other hand, is widely recognized as a staunch Brexit advocate. His influence within the party would undoubtedly help reassure Leavers about the Conservative party’s commitment to Brexit. However, several factors make this scenario unlikely.\nChallenges to Nigel Farage’s Return\nFirstly, Nigel Farage has been openly critical of Rishi Sunak’s government, describing some prominent Tories as “dismal” and “toothless Tory attack puppies.” He has expressed the belief that he achieved more outside the Conservative party than he ever could from within it.\nFurthermore, Farage’s return to the party would likely result in increased influence, potentially even a seat in Parliament or leadership. While this may be a serious possibility, it is met with skepticism by many within the party, including Rishi Sunak.\nConclusion\nThe idea of Nigel Farage rejoining the Conservative party is an intriguing one, especially in the current political climate. While it would undoubtedly help solidify the party’s Brexit credentials, it faces significant challenges and resistance from various quarters. Whether Rishi Sunak will take the bold step of inviting Farage back or not remains uncertain. Nonetheless, it is a topic that highlights the ongoing evolution of the Conservative party as it navigates the post-Brexit era.",

The “far-Right” has been blocked from forming a government, and a financial crisis has been averted. With the surprising results from the French elections last night showing Marine Le Pen’s National Rally dropping to third place in the new Parliament, it would be easy to assume that the country was getting back to normal. But hold on. The election massively strengthened the far-Left – and it is the Marxist extremists that pose the real threat to the survival of the single currency.\nCompared to the UK’s election, France’s was certainly a shock. With the final votes tallied, Le Pen’s NR and its allies won only 143 seats in the new Parliament, President Macron’s Ensemble secured 168, and the New Popular Front won 182. Although the NR won 37 per cent of the votes, far more than any other party, tactical voting in a two-round system meant it was locked out of power. Here’s the problem, however. Blocking Le Pen also meant handing a huge increase in power to a New Popular Front dominated by Jean-Luc Melenchon’s France Unbowed. And ironically, it is even more extreme than the NR.\nIn reality, the Popular Front’s manifesto makes Jeremy Corbyn look like a moderate. It promised 150 billion euros in extra public spending, increasing public sector salaries by 10 per cent immediately, making transport free, and lowering the retirement age back to 62, with longer-term plans to hire more teachers and healthcare workers and invest more in green energy. It would pay for all of that with higher corporate taxes, with a wealth tax, and by borrowing more money.\nThe NR had plenty of plans for spending more money too, and had nothing to say on liberalising the economy, or restoring its competitiveness, but the Popular Front is far more radical. Indeed, an analysis by Bloomberg showed debt as a percentage of GDP rising to almost 130 per cent by 2027 under the Popular Front, compared with 120 per cent for the NR, and 110 per cent under Macron’s outgoing government.\nThat is not all. A far-Left administration in Paris is far less likely to accept the discipline of the bond markets and the credit rating agencies than the Right. As bonds started to sell off in anticipation of an NR government, the party started to water down its plans, and showed signs of accepting fiscal constraints. By contrast, the Left doubled down on extra spending.\nWith a visceral hostility to the “markets”, and a history of currency controls – Francois Mitterand’s Communist-Socialist government of the early 1980s imposed an annual limit of $450 on foreign spending and banned the use of credit cards abroad – it will be far more willing to take on the financial markets to stop money flooding out of the country. It does not have to “detoxify” itself to win power in the way that Le Pen’s party has to. Voters are far more willing to accept it on its own terms. And perhaps most importantly, it is very hard to see the European Central Bank stepping into the market to rescue a far-Left government.\nThe harsh reality is this. French voters, even more than British ones, have become addicted to vast and rising levels of government spending. Almost 80 per cent of the electorate voted for a big increase in the deficit. It might get away with that for a few more years. And yet, it is not sustainable within a single currency.\nOther countries made genuine sacrifices to stay within the currency zone – Greek GDP for example is still well below its 2000 level – but the French refuse to do so, complacently assuming they will be bailed out by their neighbours. Sooner or later that will bring the system crashing down – and ironically the newly emboldened far-Left is far more likely to trigger that collapse than the Right.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_a-petition-for-a-sex-offenders-register-in-cyprus/content_379.html": "Why does Cyprus need a Sex Offender’s Register?\nTue 25Th Sep 2 boys aged 11 school Larnaca, they were led away by a cunning abductor, they were drugged and in his apartment for over 6 hours, until they were found by police asleep in his bed after being drugged! In response to this and many other offences against children, there is now a petition for a sex offender’s register in Cyprus, which has been praised, but is getting off to a slow start, the needs to change!\nThe civil liberties campaign group Liberty has expressed concern about the range of offences covered by the register. Derek Green, the director of the child protection organisation RWA, opposes exempting people cautioned or convicted of certain sexual offences from being placed on the register. He says it is worth monitoring those cautioned for minor sexual offences in order to see whether they repeat their behaviour.\nThe sex crimes consultant, who works with the police, said: “For example, if a young person cautioned for indecent exposure comes before the police or courts again while being monitored on the register, then there may well be an on-going problem there.”\nhttps://youtu.be/AOuXJB_KCx4\nWho gets told about the movements of sex offenders?\nHead teachers, doctors, youth leaders, sports club managers and others, including landlords, are notified of the existence of a local sex offender on a confidential basis, but a system of general disclosure is unlikely to happen in Britain. Is that far reaching enough? Not really…..parents must have a right to know if their children are in danger of coming in to contact with a sex offender. After the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne in 2000, who was 8, her parents campaigned for the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme (named Sarah’s law) which gave parents the legal right to information about registered sex offenders who may come in to contact with their children.\nWhile in the US, parents have access to pictures and details of all registered paedophiles. This right is known as “Megan’s law”, named after seven-year-old Megan Kanka, who was found strangled near her New Jersey home six years ago. Her parents campaigned for the police to notify communities when paedophiles moved in.\nIn the case of the 2 boys abducted in Larnaca, it is alleged that the man had not previously committed a sexual offence, but the lack of information in the public arena in the past week, speaks volumes, there has been TOO MUCH silence…..remember these boys were lured by him, drugged by him and found asleep in his bedroom by police who also took computers away. Even though he claimed that he was seeking to request a ransom, that does not hold water, that sounds like a lesser risk than admitting the vile truth.\nChildren do need to be protected at any cost and the most common first port of call for sex offenders is the internet, therefore that should be where surveillance should begin. Even if these people need to be entrapped, then so be it, better an offender who feels hard done by, than a child who has been abused! There are organisations in the UK who’s objective is to protect children from sexual abuse, for example, The Lucy Faithfull Foundation even has a confidential helpline available for anyone to report sexual abuse, or the danger of it, free and confidentially, something similar is necessary in Cyprus.\nTherefore, I would urge you to sign the petition via the link below, let’s make sure that this law is brought in to practice and enforced.\nFurther details about the UK Sex Offender’s Register which could be a role model for Cyprus.\nWhat is the sex offenders register?\nThe sex offenders register contains the details of anyone convicted, cautioned or released from prison for sexual offence against children or adults since September 1997, when it was set up. The register, which is run by the police, is not retro-active, so does not include anyone convicted before 1997. There are around 29,000 people on the register in the UK.\nHow do the police know where the sex offenders are?\nUnder the Sex Offenders Act 1997, as amended by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, all convicted sex offenders must register with the police within three days of their conviction or release from prison. This is monitored by the police, who receive notification from the courts following conviction, and both the prisons and probation service following an offender’s release into the community.\nFailure to register is an offence which can carry a term of imprisonment. Registrants must inform the police within three days if they change their name or address, and disclose if they are spending seven days or more away from their home. Convicted sex offenders have to register with their local police every year.\nWhat else does a registered offender have to do?\nThose on the register are required to notify the police if they change their name or address, and are also required to reveal any plans to travel outside the UK. Again, failure to comply is an offence. The police can photograph offenders every time they register, and all forces exchange information about the movements of such offenders, with a national computerised database having been set up to facilitate this procedure.\nPolice forces can also apply for sex offender orders that bar offenders from certain activities and areas frequented by children. The most high-risk offenders are subject to further surveillance – which can include electronic tagging – by local multi-agency public protection panels which include police, probation, social services and other agencies. Offenders are given strict licence conditions and can be sent back to jail if they fail to cooperate.\nHow long do offenders remain on the register?\nIt depends on the offence. Those given a jail sentence of more than 30 months for sexual offending are placed on the register indefinitely. Those imprisoned for between six and 30 months remain on the register for 10 years, or five years if they are under 18. Those sentenced for six months or less are placed on the register for seven years, or three and a half years if under 18. Those cautioned for a sexual offence are put on the register for two years, or one year if under 18.\nWhat checks are in place once someone is removed from the register?\nAn enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, required for anyone who works with children, would flag up someone’s presence on the register, or previous convictions or cautions, to a potential employer. It would also provide “soft” intelligence about allegations and concerns – for example if the police had been called round to their house due to a report of domestic violence.\nHow comprehensive is the register?\nThe Home Office says 97% of convicted sex offenders are on the register, but some offenders deliberately pursue an itinerant lifestyle in order to avoid registration. Furthermore, there is concern that many instances of sexual abuse – particularly against children – go unreported. This is because young victims are less likely to report abuse and can feel intimidated, embarrassed or guilty, and independent witnesses are rare.\nDonald Findlater, the project manager of the child protection charity Stop It Now!, said because registration depends on the sentence an offender receives some people slip through the net as they do not spend long enough in prison. This means some convicted offenders are not registered.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_taxation/content_381.html": "Taxation\nWho would have thought that a conservative government would raise taxes across the board, to their highest level for decades? Taking our corporation tax from 18% to 25% in the middle of a crisis, is probably one of the greatest errors in the history of Number 11. In the meantime, Ireland has reduced it’s corporation tax and their economy is booming, thanks to many large overseas companies moving there, whilst we are making the UK less and less attractive to them.\nSMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) make up the vast majority of companies and corporate tax in the UK, so what is the logic in handicapping them in the current climate.\nWe have one of the most respected currencies in the world, let’s not forget that during the financial crisis, the GDP was one of the ‘go-to’ currencies, with so much potential to encourage investment and channel it to make our nation a better place for all, but instead, hardworking people at all levels, excluding the elite of course, are being punished and the government is seeking ever increasing underhand methods to take more from them, or lessen their position, their wealth, their voice and their freedom.\nWhen will the lesson be learned, that higher taxation results in lower revenue? Since the ‘reform’ of stamp duty under George Osborne in 2014, the revenue collected from the upper quartile has been less, even though the maximum rate for properties over £1.5m could be as much as 17% for an overseas investor, buying an additional property, for everyone else, it is still 12% and the result is that property in that sector stagnated and is worth no more today, than it was in 2016, particularly in London.\nFiscal Drag\nYet another deception masterpiece from the Chancellor, who has frozen the basic and high rate tax free allowance until 2028, have you any idea how much money that enables the Exchequer to take from working people over the next five years? Not to mention the following few years, as it will not catch to the level it should be, in real terms for years, if ever.\nAs it stands, the high inflation is working in the Governments favour, because a rise in costs of say 10% followed by a rise in salaries of 10% (assuming that did happen) would not result in people ‘level-pegging’ as they would in reality be worse off. This change will push many people who were never intended to be subjected to high-rate-tax, in to that bracket, that is totally wrong.\nOnline Sales\nThe large multinationals like Amazon are destroying our retail industry, which has been on the decline for decades. Firstly the small retailers were basically run out of town by the large department stores in the 70s and 80s, however these large stores, then gradually left our high streets, when they began moving to retail parks, leaving our precious high streets to wither and die.\nThis decline, though already in full swing, was accelerated by the lockdown, when so many small retailers shut-shop, as a result of the sheer size of companies like Amazon, but for these multi-nationals, taxation is almost an ‘option’\nThere were over £100 billion in online sales last year, at this point, I cannot confirm if that includes the Billions in sales that are made directly from companies such as Aliexpress, who do not have any obligation to the UK exchequer.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-benefits-of-mentoring/content_153.html": "The benefits of mentoring\nBenefits of Mentoring for Young People\nMentoring is often one component of a program that involves other elements, such as tutoring or life skills training and coaching. The supportive, healthy relationships formed between mentors and mentees are both immediate and long-term and contribute to a host of benefits for mentors and mentees.\nBenefits for youth:\n- Increased high school graduation rates\n- Lower high school dropout rates\n- Healthier relationships and lifestyle choices\n- Better attitude about school\n- Higher college enrollment rates and higher educational aspirations\n- Enhanced self-esteem and self-confidence\n- Improved behavior, both at home and at school\n- Stronger relationships with parents, teachers, and peers\n- Improved interpersonal skills\n- Decreased likelihood of initiating drug and alcohol use (MENTOR, 2009; Cavell, DuBois, Karcher, Keller, & Rhodes, 2009)\nPotential Educational Benefits\nBetter academic performance. A 1995 study of the Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) program found mentored youth earned higher grades than a similar group of young people who did not have mentors (Tierny, Grossman, & Resch, 1995). Further, the 2007 study of the program found youth in school-based mentoring programs turned in higher quality class work, did better academically (especially in science and written and oral communication), and completed more of their assignments than their peers who did not have mentors. These results, while positive, were small in magnitude and did not last into the following school year (Herrera, Grossman, Kauh, Feldman, McMaken, & Jucovy, 2007). While a trend toward improved academic performance has been found through research on mentoring programs, Jekielek, Moore and Hair (2002) indicate that studies of mentoring programs do not show consistent improved academic outcomes.\nBetter school attendance. Youth with mentors had fewer unexcused absences from class than students without mentors (Tierny, Grossman, Resch, 2000; Herrera, Grossman, Kauh, Feldman, McMaken, & Jucovy, 2007). For example, youth participating in the Across Ages mentoring program showed a gain of more than a week of classes attended, compared with those youth not participating in the program (Jekielek et al., 2002).\nPositive attitudes. Teachers of students in the BELONG mentoring program reported that students participating in mentoring were more engaged in the classroom and also seemed to place a higher value on school than students who did not have mentors (Blakely, Menon, & Jones, 1995).\nDecreased likelihood of initiating illegal drug and alcohol use. A BBBS study showed youth with mentors were less likely to begin using drugs or alcohol during the eighteen-month period of the study than their peers. Specifically, 6.2 percent of youth with mentors initiated drug use compared to 11.4 percent of their peers without mentors, and 19.4 percent initiated alcohol use compared to 26.7 percent. These findings were more substantial for minority youth (Tierny et al., 1995). Findings from a study of the Across Ages mentoring program showed that mentees gained important life skills to help them stay away from drugs (LoSciuto, Rajala, Townsend, & Taylor, 1996).\nDecreased violent behavior. Mentees in the BBBS program were 32 percent less likely to report having hit someone over the past year than the young people without mentors (Tierny et al., 1995). Jekielek et al. (2002) found that four mentoring programs showed reductions of some behaviors related to delinquency and negative behaviors, but did not eliminate all delinquent behaviors.\nMentoring has also been linked in studies to social-emotional development benefits, improvements in youth perceptions of parental relationships, and better prospects for moving on to higher education.\nThis section has been adapted from Federal Mentoring Council and Jekielek, Moore, & Hair, 2002.\nBenefits for mentors:\n- Increased self-esteem\n- A sense of accomplishment\n- Creation of networks of volunteers\n- Insight into childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood\n- Increased patience and improved supervisory skills (U.S. Department of Labor, n.d.)\nMentoring can help youth as they go through challenging life transitions, including dealing with stressful changes at home or transitioning to adulthood. Close, healthy, supportive relationships between mentors and mentees that last for a significant portion of time (i.e., more than one year) are central to success. Without this, mentoring programs run the risk of harming young people who are paired with mentors ill-equipped to meet the mentees’ needs. Specifically, relationships with mentors that last less than three months; where there is irregular and inconsistent contact; where there is a disconnect between the personalities, interests, and expectations of the mentors and mentees; where mentors are unprepared and lack skills to relate to youth; and where there is no emotional bond between the mentor and mentee have been found to be harmful to youth (Jekielek et al., 2002; Rhodes & DuBois, 2006).",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_entertainers-in-cyprus-not-being-paid/content_182.html": "It has been reported that many of the migrants working in the entertainment industry in Cyprus are underpaid and some not paid at all.\nSeasonal entertainers in Paphos hotels are complaining that the agencies that hire them are not paying their wages and in some cases threaten violence when they complain. The Sunday Mail has spoken to a number of singers, dancers and other acts that say that some agents are pocketing wages for themselves.\n“It’s like the mafia. There are a couple of agencies in particular, one in Paphos and one that works island wide, that you don’t want to get on the wrong side of,” one entertainer told the Sunday Mail.\n“They use their muscle to scare you and they are scam artists. I wish I was brave enough to give my name, but I just can’t.”\nAll but one of the entertainers requested to remain unnamed when they spoke to the newspaper, as they are fearful of possible serious repercussions, both financial and physical. Another professional performer said that the owner of an agency had actually threatened to kill his pregnant wife. He owed the pair money and was also angered when a hotel employed them directly, instead of using his agency. “We didn’t go to the police, as these people can be very volatile. There are many dancers that don’t want to come to work in Paphos as it has a reputation for not paying,” he said.\nPaphos police spokesperson, Nicos Tsappis, told the Sunday Mail that no such instances have been reported so far. “If any threats are being made against people by employers, then the police will investigate and take the matter very seriously,” he said. “People should not be afraid to come forward.” Yet those that say they have been cheated clearly are scared.\nThey say they have been scammed in a number of ways: wage cheques issued and then cancelled before they can be cleared by the bank, and in some cases professional dancers and performers remain unpaid by the agents after they refused to give them any money at all. This can be hard to prove when no contracts have been issued or signed, just verbal agreements and a ‘gentleman’s handshake.’ Most entertainment agencies in Cyprus are well run and operate above board, but, as is the case in tourist hot spots all over the world, there are always exceptions.\nAdverts such as this one found online appear on social media and entertainment sites and in publications aimed at performers: ‘Hotel entertainers (animators) with or without experience for seasonal contracts. If you are interested and, please send us a message for more information.’ Often, inexperienced youngsters will apply and can expect to be paid around 500 euros a month, plus accommodation and food. Higher amounts apply to those which don’t include these.\n“I know of dancers and singers who are in their teens, who were hired in Paphos on contracts for the season and the agency failed to pay them anything,” one dancer said. “They can’t go to court as they have no money for a lawyer and they end up leaving Cyprus empty handed.”\nShe explained that venues and hotels are paying the agencies, but then some agencies are pocketing the money for themselves and not passing it on to the acts. The head of the hoteliers’ association of Paphos, Euripides Loizides, who has his own hotel and pays an agency for his performers, said that he is unaware of any such cases. If he found out performers at his hotel were not being paid by the agency that hired them, he would step in and pay acts directly the following month, he said.\n“We (hotels) use agencies as we trust them to do the job better than us in this area, as it’s their profession, they have the experience and connections. I have used various entertainment agencies through the years.” Loizdes pays around 8,000 euros a month for his entertainment programme which includes a full time ‘animator’, and an animation team. They offer aqua aerobics, all sorts of day time activities, a kids’ disco and seven full shows every week.\n“I am surprised to learn that this is happening. It’s down to each hotel to decide if they use individual performers directly or employ an agency. Some have limited budgets and make savings,” he said. “At my hotel, it is important for us to have entertainment and we always check that the agency has employers’ liability insurance.”\nGiedre Sky arrived in Cyprus from Lithuania in 2010 after answering an advert. She underwent training in Ayia Napa. She speaks four languages. She has experienced both good and bad situations. One job saw her and three other girls, as well as their luggage, crammed into a single room. “Once, I worked in Paphos at a hotel doing all sorts of things like aqua aerobics, kids club and other stuff, It was nice and relaxed, but I received another offer from Ayia Napa which was more money and I explained this to the agency. They said they were fine with it and I gave two weeks’ notice and trained up another girl to take my place.” However, their attitude changed once she left.\n“They kept making excuses and then said they would bring me my salary to Ayia Napa, but they never did. Then they stopped answering my calls. I complained to the authorities, but they didn’t do anything about it.”\n“It’s better if you work for a hotel directly as you get paid directly from them. Agencies can always find a reason not to pay if they don’t want to and the system will ensure the hotels have to pay you.”\nOne performer said that after trying, and failing, to get paid money owed to him from a Paphos agency for work last year, enquiries uncovered that an entire group of entertainers were all owed more than one month’s wages, some an entire season, as they were told they would be paid at the end of the season.\n“For a long time, these people have been issuing cheques and then cancelling them before they get paid into our accounts. Some of the venues and hotels know what they are doing but they keep on using them, they don’t care.”\nNo contracts were made in most instances, only agreements via text messages. He added that their calls and emails are now going unanswered.\nLawyer Tasos Coucounis urged unpaid performers to seek legal advice as soon as possible.\n“It’s better to have a written contract,” he said. “But also text messages confirming terms of employment, pay and these sorts of things are also admissible evidence in court.”\nBut an initial consultation with a lawyer could be anything from 80 to 170 euros.\nTsappis said that if agencies are issuing cheques and purposefully cancelling them, there is a case and victims of such a crime can report it to the police or get legal advice.\n“As the lawyer says, text messages are evidence and any cancelled cheques are exhibits. In fact this is the best exhibit to prove the charge,” he said.\nObviously, he added, a charge of non payment of cash is more difficult to prove.\nHe said that complaints can also be made to social insurance. Employers are afraid of this route, as very high fines can be imposed if the employer is not following the regulations.\nBut the fear of going to the authorities remains.\n“We all know that this is a crime and must stop, but people are afraid to stand up for themselves and so this practice will just continue,” one entertainer said.\nCOMMENT\nJust when we thought that we may have reached the bottom, in the realms of moral injustice, we are faced with yet another revelation that demonstrates the degree of moral bankruptcy that exists in Cyprus. I have no doubt that this happens, in the past we had ‘Cabarets’ which were glorified clubs for the purchase of favours from imported ladies, who had often flown to Cyprus under a misapprehension, which was not an accident, it was very much by design to get them there and them manipulate, pressure or even threaten them in to a life of prostitution.\nI personally had a pub in Larnaca a few years ago and I made the strategic error of getting involved with a girl who had recently arrived and was being pressured by a Cabaret owner. After we got close she left and had to go in to hiding due to the threats while I entered the world of retribution by all those involved. I was suddenly being persecuted by the Police they came every day and found an excuse to give me a penalty, I gathered over 40 in a two month period!\nWe are also very much aware that many women who are brought in as domestic assistants suddenly find themselves actually made to maintain two or three homes, or they are forced to hand back some of their salary and if they do not, they are abused, threatened and the with the law being the way it is in Cyprus, they are conveniently at a disadvantage.\nI believe that there is a real need for an anonymous helpline and an independent body designed to protect these workers. Independent, now that is an uphill task within the corruption of Cyprus, the only realistic way would be if the team were NOT Cypriot, there is no way that any group of Cypriots can be trusted to police anything!",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_ulez-is-a-disgraceful-tax-on-the-poor/content_197.html": "ULEZ is a disgraceful tax on the poor\nThe ULEZ charge was introduced in 2019, placing thousands of motorists at the mercy of a daily charge to drive into the zone. This affected Petrol vehicles that are not Euro 4 and Diesel vehicles that are not Euro 6. On the face of it, this may seem to be an admirable change, helping to make the capital a cleaner place, by reducing the volume of harmful emissions that we all breath in.\nI beg to differ……..the only people who are required to pay this charge are those who have Diesel vehicles older than around 2014, or petrol vehicles older than around 2004, who would actually own these vehicles?\n“Only those who cannot afford a newer vehicle would own one that is subject to the ULEZ charge.\nHow can this be really justified? Surely a more sensible and logical approach would have been to set a limit on vehicle emissions on a sliding scale and actually ban them from central London? If a maximum of 300g/km were introduced, then reduced year on year, based on a sliding scale, 275, 250, 225 and so on, that would be both logical, effective and most important of all, it would be fair!\nAs it stands, those who can afford to pay, must be jumping for joy, year on year, the combination of the congestion charge and ULEZ is reducing the number of cars that can enter central London, whilst the wealthy ‘play-boys’ can fly their supercars in and drive around the streets of London as though they own them.\nOne of the most cynical events of this entire charade was the comment from the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, that he we disappointed with the revenue collected by extension of the ULEZ zone to all areas within the North & South circular, just think about this for a minute:\n“He was disappointed that there were not enough people who could not afford newer cars, entering the ULEZ zone and paying his extortion fee!\nCan anyone possibly stoop lower than that?\nDo we need to reduce emissions in our towns and cities? Yes of course! Is there an effective way for this to happen? Yes there is! Car manufacturers have not had enough pressure placed upon them to produce cleaner vehicles fast enough. Had there been a cap on emissions introduced on a sliding scale years ago, we would already be down to a maximum that is far lower than the average car is now, but it would have been introduced gradually and evenly. Is it right that people who are increasingly facing the choice of heating or food, be punished for their poverty?\nIs it right that those who can afford the latest and cleanest, should be rewarded? I think not!\nThere need not have been a congestion charge and a ULEZ charge, just a blanket reduction of emissions, full stop. However, how do we reduce the massive number of vehicles that drive in to London and most cities on a daily basis? At the moment, once again, it is down to affordability. As anyone who has been brave enough to even consider the notion of parking in central London, Oxford, Cambridge or many other cities will know, the cost can be ridiculous, once again, I have no doubt that the wealthy are thinking, “the higher the better” that ensure that there is always a space for us to park!\nCould there be another solution perhaps? Consider the effects of the following:\nWhat if the number of long stay parking spaces, no matter who they are owned by, were reduced by 10% per year, or even 5% if necessary? What would the result be?\nIn the first instance, motorists would leave home earlier, to grab the available spaces, taking the morning rush-hour from 8.00AM to 7.00AM and then 6.00AM, but at some point, many motorists would make alternative arrangements, be they car-pooling, public transport, working from home, or even moving home. Provided that this were implemented slowly, the public would adjust, the whole morning rush would change, companies would think more about how their employees could get to work, rather than concentrating on being located in a prestige location. No matter what, in less than a generation, we would have changed the entire pattern of getting to work and the dependence on the car, without causing alarm, without distressing people and most importantly, without making anyone suffer. Incremental changes are always accepted by the masses (just consider how we have accepted the erosion of our civil liberties)\nAllow me to quickly reference to the Barcelona Super-Blocks. I have written about these in a separate article, but it makes so much sense. By creating a city that is increasingly mixed use, where entire blocks are pedestrianised, with the exception of specific vehicles, they are not just residential or commercial, they are mixed use, with shops, offices and homes within the same buildings. This has created entire neighbourhoods that are not dependent on cars, but focussed on people. This cannot be done overnight, it requires planning, developers and local authorities to work together, creating the inner-cities of the future.\nThe key to this is and always has been public transport. Ever since the ‘Beeching Axe’ created dependence on the car on a national scale, there has been a real need for effective and affordable public transport. We now have electric scooters, which make perfect sense, despite the danger that they risk to irresponsible riders, but that is also the case with cyclists riding furiously, how many of you have been injured by sharp metal pedals scraping your legs as they arrogantly rush by?\nAs cars are reduced, there will be more space for pedestrians, cyclists and scooters to travel safely, without being a danger to each other. We are in the midst of a motoring bottleneck, it takes longer to cross London today, than it did 100 years ago, that should really put it in to perspective.\nThe moral is, we are all aware that change is needed, but it must be planned, it must be an evolution, it should not be little more than ‘virtue-signalling, knee-jerk reactions that do little more than repeat a rhetoric, but in reality, do nothing more than punish those who cannot afford to change their circumstances in sync with changes on government policy.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-uk-should-withdraw-from-the-european-court-of-human-rights/content_449.html": "The UK Should Withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has recently come under scrutiny in the UK for its role in shaping policies related to immigration and human rights. In a recent YouTube video, commentators discuss whether the UK government should withdraw from the ECHR and what impact this could have.\nWhat is the ECHR and why is it controversial?\nThe ECHR was established after World War II to uphold basic human rights across Europe. It oversees implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court issues binding rulings on whether countries have violated these rights.\nAs one commentator points out, the ECHR essentially creates new laws by interpreting the Convention’s broad principles. Its judgments can even overturn UK Supreme Court decisions. Many in the UK see this as an unacceptable infringement on British sovereignty. There is a sense that the ECHR impedes the government’s ability to control immigration and carry out the will of voters.\nShould the UK withdraw from the ECHR?\nSome argue that leaving the ECHR would diminish human rights protections in the UK. However, one speaker dismisses this, noting that Britain led efforts to institute human rights globally when it had an empire. The implication is that traditional British values sufficiently uphold human rights without the need for external oversight.\nThere are also arguments that withdrawal from the ECHR is unnecessary to resolve immigration issues. As one panelist states, the government can stop migrant boats under international law without leaving the Convention. Once migrants reach the UK the ECHR becomes relevant, but preventing entry in the first place would avoid this.\nIs the ECHR a distraction from wider government failures?\nOne commentator argues strongly that the focus on the ECHR is a distraction from the government’s lack of progress on its immigration promises. Under Conservative leadership, legal and illegal immigration rates have hit record highs. Measures like the Rwanda deportation scheme are predicted to affect only a small percentage of arrivals.\nThere is criticism that while the ECHR makes for attention-grabbing headlines, it obscures the Conservatives’ inability to control migration numbers. This broken promise is seen as contributing to problems like long NHS waits and the UK’s housing shortage.\nWhat about the social impact of high migration?\nBeyond economics, one speaker raises concerns about the rapid pace of demographic change brought by high immigration levels. Over one million migrants legally entered the UK last year alone.\nThe argument is that such a swift shift risks damaging the nation’s social fabric if new arrivals do not integrate. Multiculturalism only works if core values evolve gradually in tandem. Otherwise, isolated communities form, preventing social cohesion. There are fears of the UK becoming a profoundly divided society.\nFinal thoughts\nThe debate over the ECHR touches on issues of national sovereignty, immigration control, and social stability. Withdrawal from the court appears unlikely to fully resolve concerns over increasing migration levels. Yet debate continues around whether an external human rights body should wield such influence over UK laws.\nGoing forward, the government faces pressure from multiple angles. It must demonstrate progress on bringing immigration numbers down to ease social pressures. At the same time, walking away from European human rights institutions risks accusations of diminished commitments to rights protections. Striking the right balance will prove a complex challenge.\nKey Takeaways\n• The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) is seen as overreaching by some in the UK for its ability to shape laws and overturn court rulings\n• Withdrawing from the ECHR may not resolve immigration issues as the government can block boats under international law\n• There are arguments the focus on the ECHR distracts from the government breaking promises to control migration\n• High levels of immigration risk damaging social cohesion if new arrivals don’t integrate and adopt gradual value shifts\n• Leaving the ECHR could lead to accusations of diminished human rights commitments\n• The government faces satisfying competing pressures on sovereignty, immigration control, and social stability\nIn summary, while withdrawing from the ECHR may regain some legal sovereignty, it seems unlikely to fully balance concerns over rising migration and rapid demographic shifts. The debate involves complex trade-offs with vocal arguments on all sides.",

Authorities haven’t named him publicly.\nQuestions about police ineptitude or indifference possibly allowing the suspect to keep killing for about 2 ½ years after the first victim was reported missing have been part of the painful fallout.\nAt a second vigil for the seven slaying victims outside the presidential palace in Nicosia on Friday, participants also expressed concerns that racism and economic inequality were other factors; many women from the Philippines work as housekeepers in Cyprus, and four of the victims were Filipino.\n“I mean, if it would be a Cypriot woman missing for so long, they would definitely do something,” Katarzyna Kyrlitsias, who is from Poland and married to a Cypriot citizen, said. “But because we’re foreigners, they think nobody would find them, nobody would look for them.”\nResidents, immigrant rights activists and government officials say they want to know if and exactly how police failures contributed to killings instead of preventing them.\nYiota Papadopoulou, whose husband is a prominent Cypriot politician, said she asked in October 2016 for help learning the whereabouts of a Romanian woman and her child after the pair vanished.\nA police officer told her authorities had good reason to believe 36-year-old Livia Florentina Bunea took her 8-year-old daughter to the ethnically divided nation’s breakaway Turkish Cypriot north, Papadopoulou said.\n“I believe that maybe, some other women could have been saved,” she told public broadcaster RIK.\nIt was only the chance discovery of 38-year-old Mary Rose Tiburcio’s bound body down the mineshaft on April 14 that sparked a full investigation. Authorities detained the suspect soon after tracking the dead woman’s online message exchanges with the army captain.\nThe head of the Cyprus Domestic Workers’ Association, Louis Koutroukides, has recounted that when he reported Tiburcio missing last year, a police officer said he was “too old to concern himself with Filipino women.”\nCyprus President Nicos Anastasiades has promised the government would scrupulously investigate both the “abhorrent murders” and the “actions or failures” of police in following up on missing person cases.\nAnastasiades fired Police Chief Zacharias Chrysostomou on Friday for what he said was “possible negligence” in carrying out swift and thorough investigations that could have saved lives.\nJustice Minister Ionas Nicolaou, who resigned Thursday, also spoke of “possible mistakes” by law enforcement. He also alluded to darker “attitudes and perceptions” pervading society “that honor no one.”\nCyprus has a Filipino community of about 14,000 that experiences discrimination and exploitation, according to civil rights advocate Lissa Jataas. Four of the people the suspect said he killed, including Tiburcio and her 6-year-old daughter, were Filipino.\nA noticeable number of Filipino immigrants earn 400 euros ($450) per month working long hours as housekeepers for employers who hold their passports and work permits.\n“We’re very vulnerable to abuse and harassment at work because our workplace is our home as well,” Jataas said, adding that many workers keep complaints to themselves for fear of being deported.\nEster Beatty, chair of the Federation of Filipino Organizations in Cyprus, said she hopes the killings “serve as a wake-up call to those nasty employers” to adhere to European employment standards.\nIt’s a view shared by others at Friday’s protest vigil. Guarab Nepal said he feels as if people from Asian countries are ignored in Cyprus\n“The government should respect the people who came here to work,” he said.\nEven the police’s most ardent supporters concede that the investigation of the initial missing persons’ reports were insufficient. Police Support Association head Neophytos Papamiltiadous acknowledged a lack of proper oversight by those officers’ immediate superiors.\nHowever, Papamiltiadous rejected the notion that racism was a major factor, noting that foreign workers do cross into the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north without notifying authorities.\nDivided in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece, Cyprus’ northern third is an unrecognized entity and Cypriot police have no jurisdiction there. The legal vacuum affords those who want to disappear a way out.\nBut Papamiltiadous said that’s certainly no excuse for lackadaisical police work.\nWith no real voice, it is easy for some police officers to ignore foreign worker complaints or missing person reports if they’re under no pressure to do so, said Stefanos Spaneas, a professor of social work at the University of Nicosia.\nSpaneas said in his experience with working with migrants and refugees it’s less a matter of police racism than one of “stupidity” within a disorganized force made up of officers earning low pay.\nKyrlitsias, the Polish woman with a Cypriot spouse who attended the vigil outside the palace, said the killings have changed how she feels in Cyprus regardless of what comes out of the serial killer investigation.\n“Cyprus is a nice country and actually is very safe,” she said. “But what happened now, it’s very difficult to feel safe because you never know who will text you.”",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_britain-faces-a-turning-point-over-trumps-tariffs/content_143.html": "Britain faces a turning point over Trump’s tariffs\nBritain Awakens to Trump’s Tariffs as Global Recession Fears Mount\nBritain has awakened to the sobering reality of President Trump’s newly implemented tariffs and a chilling message from investment firm JP Morgan: “There will be blood.” The financial giant has raised its prediction for the likelihood of a global recession from 40% to 60%, triggered by the minimum 10% levy that came into effect at 5:00 a.m. this morning, capping off what has been a brutal week for global markets.\nThis economic development follows yesterday’s declaration of a trade war between America and China. In response to these mounting tensions, Prime Minister Starmer is reportedly making a bid to secure a deal with the United States. As part of these diplomatic efforts, it is expected that President Trump will receive an invitation to meet the King at Balmoral and play a round of golf at the President’s resort in Scotland.\nAn Unprecedented Global Trade War\nThe tariffs, whilst appearing modest at first glance with their 10% rate, have been applied using a complicated formula that significantly amplifies their impact. Experts describe this as an “unprecedented global trade war” initiated by Trump. Although he spoke extensively about reshaping the global economy during his campaign, many observers remained unsure about how literally to take his promises. Now, it appears he has been as good as his word, taking this extraordinary action that has sent shockwaves through international markets.\nDue to Brexit, Britain has actually received something of a reprieve, facing a 10% tariff across the board as opposed to the 20% levy imposed on the European Union. Nevertheless, a 10% tariff remains significantly worse than no tariff at all, and if these measures remain in place, they will have serious ramifications for the British economy.\nBritain’s Calm Response\nWhile other nations are fighting back with retaliatory tariffs or at least threatening them, the UK government has adopted a notably calm approach. This strategy has drawn praise from some quarters, with observers giving credit to the Starmer government for not rushing into retaliatory measures. Instead, Britain appears to be focusing on securing a deal with the United States, which would undoubtedly be better for all concerned, particularly the economy.\nCritics, however, suggest that Britain’s measured response may be less about strategy and more about a lack of options. They point out that members of Starmer’s front bench have previously made disparaging remarks about Trump, with some reportedly calling him a “neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath” and others, including Peter Mandelson, labelling him “dangerous.” These past comments may have severely limited Britain’s negotiating power, forcing the government to adopt a conciliatory approach.\nIndustries at Risk\nParticularly concerning for the UK are the potential impacts on whisky producers and car manufacturers, two industries that would be most severely affected if the 10% tariff remains in place. But beyond specific sectors, there is a larger concern that these escalating trade tensions could create a negative spiral globally, with countries imposing and counter-imposing tariffs, ultimately damaging the overall global economy with repercussions felt by all.\nA Singapore on Thames?\nFormer Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has suggested that this crisis presents an opportunity for the UK to transform itself into a “Singapore on Thames” – with lower taxes, reduced welfare, a smaller state, and a highly skilled workforce. Hunt argues that such reforms would put Britain in a better position to weather any global economic downturn and potentially even take advantage of it.\nCritics have been quick to point out the irony of these comments coming from Hunt, who presided over a government that implemented some of the highest tax rates in British history until the current administration took office. Nevertheless, there is broad agreement that the current situation does present an opportunity for the UK to “get its house in order,” as nothing prompts creativity and innovation quite like a crisis. Whether the government can actually deliver on the necessary changes remains an open question.\nAmerican Public Opinion\nInterestingly, the latest Gallup polling shows that an overwhelming number of Americans are actually against the trade war, indicating a preference for free trade. This stands in contrast to other aspects of Trump’s agenda, such as his border policies and his rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which enjoy substantial public support.\nDespite this divergence between the President and public opinion, Trump remains committed to his course of action and shows no signs of backing down. This disconnect between presidential policy and public sentiment will be an important dynamic to watch, as will the responses of other countries as they decide how to negotiate and what they might bring to the table.\nGlobal Market Reaction\nThe immediate impact on global markets has been severe, with stock markets reportedly losing nearly $6 trillion in just two days – approximately $10 trillion since Trump took office. Markets are pricing in more interest rate cuts than previously anticipated, which aligns with Trump’s desires as it would reduce the cost of servicing America’s substantial national debt.\nFederal Reserve Chair Powell has stated that the American economy remains solid, with strong payroll numbers, and that the Fed is adopting a “wait and see” approach regarding the potential impact on global recession and inflation. For now, no immediate action is planned, despite Trump’s calls for rate cuts.\nEarly Signs of Movement\nSome nations are already responding to the new tariffs with constructive engagement rather than confrontation. Israel has begun negotiating a trade agreement, Vietnam has announced it will lower its tariffs to zero, and Ukrainian President Zelensky has stated that the tariffs will not impact his country.\nMore discussions about these tariffs are expected over the weekend, with many observers characterising Trump’s approach as a high-stakes gamble. However, supporters point out that Trump secured a strong mandate in the election and is now delivering on his campaign promises across multiple fronts – negotiating peace deals, addressing immigration and border issues, and now working to bring critical manufacturing back to the US whilst addressing supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly in relation to China and industries critical to American interests such as pharmaceuticals.\nA Disruption of the Global Order\nSome analysts suggest that the negative reaction to Trump’s policies stems largely from his disruption of an established global order. They argue that his approach – challenging conventional wisdom and prioritising American interests – represents a bold departure from established norms that many international actors find uncomfortable.\nSupporters of Trump’s tariff policy argue that it will ultimately prove beneficial for American industry by encouraging companies to establish or expand their operations within the United States. They contend that Trump is thinking long-term about America’s economic future, seeking to restore economic sovereignty over key industries during his final four years in power.\nHistorically, America has maintained relatively low tariffs at approximately 3.1%, leading some to question who truly doesn’t believe in free trade – the United States or the rest of the world. America’s exposure of GDP to trade stands at only 11%, compared to 52% for Europe and 32% for the UK, potentially giving the US greater resilience in trade disputes.\nThe Waiting Game\nThe success of Trump’s strategy may ultimately depend on patience – a commodity often in short supply when voters are feeling economic pain. The challenge for the administration will be maintaining public support during any period of adjustment, particularly if people begin to feel the impact in their pockets or through decreased values in their investment portfolios.\nEarly signs suggest that some negotiations are already underway. For example, the previously announced sale of TikTok was put on ice because of the trade war, but Trump is now extending the deadline for a deal to be completed, and ByteDance has indicated it will wait until discussions on the tariffs have concluded. This suggests an expectation that some resolution to the current tensions will be forthcoming.\nAs Britain and the world adjust to this new economic reality, only time will tell whether Trump’s bold gambit will result in beneficial new trade arrangements or a painful global recession. For now, markets, governments, and citizens alike must wait anxiously to see how this high-stakes economic chess game unfolds.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_natwest-faces-privacy-probe-bank-boss-resigns-amidst-controversy-over-nigel-farages-account/content_578.html": "NatWest Faces Privacy Probe – Bank Boss Resigns Amidst Controversy Over Nigel Farage’s Account\nIntroduction:\nNatWest, one of the UK’s major lenders, finds itself embroiled in a privacy scandal as the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) investigates whether former Chief Executive, Dame Alison Rose, breached confidentiality rules by disclosing private information about Nigel Farage’s Coutts bank account to the media. The incident has raised serious concerns about data breaches and client confidentiality in the banking sector. In response to the controversy, Dame Alison Rose has resigned, and calls for further accountability among senior NatWest figures have intensified. This blog post explores the unfolding situation and the implications it may have on the banking industry.\nThe ICO Investigation:\nThe ICO is currently assessing whether Dame Alison Rose’s actions constitute a serious data breach or a disregard for client confidentiality. Sharing a customer’s personal information with the media would clearly violate the long-standing banking duty of confidentiality, which has been in place for over a century. The privacy regulator is closely examining the information provided and conducting necessary inquiries to ascertain the extent of the breach.\nCalls for Cultural Change:\nNigel Farage has called for more accountability within NatWest, urging Chairman Sir Howard Davies and Coutts Chief Executive Peter Flavel to step down in response to the controversy. He proposes a cultural change across the banking sector to prevent similar incidents in the future. The issue has sparked a discussion about trust, as customers trust banks not only with their money but also with their personal information. Any perceived betrayal of this trust raises serious concerns for customers and regulators alike.\nImpact on NatWest:\nThe scandal has taken a toll on NatWest’s reputation and finances. The bank’s shares plummeted, losing as much as 3.7% of their value, amounting to £850 million. The negative impact on the bank’s stock value is a significant concern, especially since the bank is still 38% owned by the taxpayer. The sudden resignation of Dame Alison Rose came after an emergency board meeting, following the expression of ‘significant concerns’ from the Prime Minister and Chancellor.\nNigel Farage’s Stance:\nMr. Farage, whose Coutts account was at the center of the controversy, has branded Dame Alison Rose as ‘unfit’ to remain in her post. He accused her of leaking private and inaccurate information about his bank account to the BBC. He emphasizes the need for cultural and legal changes within the banking industry to prevent unfair treatment of customers based on their political views.\nGovernment Intervention:\nTreasury Minister Andrew Griffith has called for a search to find a replacement for Sir Howard Davies, the outgoing Chairman, but doesn’t believe he needs to step down immediately. The UK government has expressed its position on protecting consumers from being ‘de-banked’ due to their political views. Policymakers stress the importance of free speech and freedom of political opinions in the country.\nConclusion:\n– NatWest, a major UK bank, faces a privacy investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) over alleged breach of confidentiality rules.\n– Former Chief Executive Dame Alison Rose is under scrutiny for sharing private information about Nigel Farage’s Coutts bank account with the BBC.\n– The ICO is assessing whether this action constitutes a serious data breach or disregard for client confidentiality.\n– Nigel Farage calls for cultural change in the banking sector and demands more senior NatWest figures, including Chairman Sir Howard Davies and Coutts CEO Peter Flavel, to step down.\n– NatWest’s shares plummeted by 3.7%, wiping £850 million off its value following the scandal.\n– Dame Alison Rose resigned after an emergency board meeting following concerns expressed by the Prime Minister and Chancellor.\n– Mr. Farage condemns unfair treatment of customers based on their political views and calls for legal changes within the banking industry.\n– The UK government stresses the importance of free speech and consumer protection in the face of potential ‘de-banking’ due to political opinions.\nNatWest’s involvement in a privacy scandal has led to the resignation of its former Chief Executive, Dame Alison Rose, and sparked a wider debate on the banking industry’s duty of confidentiality and customer trust. As the ICO investigation continues, the case serves as a crucial reminder of the significance of safeguarding client data and maintaining confidentiality. It remains to be seen how the situation unfolds and what further measures will be taken to address potential breaches of privacy in the financial sector.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-netherlands-to-opt-out-of-eu-asylum-rules-under-wilders-strict-new-policy/content_1112.html": "The Netherlands to Opt Out of EU Asylum Rules Under Wilders’ Strict New Policy\nToughest Ever Asylum Regime Planned\nThe newly formed Dutch coalition government has announced plans to implement the “strictest-ever” asylum policy in the country, following the election victory of Geert Wilders and his far-right PVV party. The coalition agreement, reached after six months of gruelling negotiations, outlines their intention to file a request with the European Commission for an opt-out on European asylum policy “as soon as possible.”\nUnder the proposed measures, individuals without a valid residence permit will face deportation “by force if necessary.” The 26-page coalition pact highlights the aim for “the strictest ever entry rules for asylum and the most comprehensive ever package to control migration.”\nClash with Brussels Looming\nThis hardline stance on asylum seekers is set to put the new Dutch government on a collision course with leaders in Brussels, even before it has officially taken office. A European Commission spokesman appeared sceptical about the possibility of an opt-out, stating, “You cannot opt out of EU legislation… We are working on the basis of existing treaties and existing legislation.”\nHowever, the spokesman, Eric Mamer, added, “We will wait to see what a possible new Dutch government will formally propose.”\nControversial Proposals\nThe coalition agreement also includes plans to curb labour migration and implement stricter admittance requirements for foreign students at Dutch universities. Workers from outside the EU who lack specific knowledge or expertise would need a work permit, and recruiting agencies would face tighter regulation.\nFurthermore, the coalition has expressed its intention to limit free movement for people from countries joining the EU in the future, a move likely to raise eyebrows across the bloc.\nPublic Support and Opposition\nA poll conducted by the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, involving 27,000 participants, found that Wilders’ new coalition was being warmly welcomed by many. Comments included “finally, common sense,” “enough with the extreme left fantasy reality,” and “we have been tolerant far too long to those who are not tolerant!”\nHowever, opposition voices have also emerged. Frans Timmermans, the leader of the Greens-Left alliance, expressed concern, stating, “It’s a worrisome day. We now have a radical right-wing party under Wilders that finds itself at the centre of power in the Netherlands.”\nPotential Economic Impact\nThe proposed immigration measures have raised concerns within the Dutch tech industry. The association FME, representing firms like semiconductor giant ASML, warned that such policies could make it difficult for tech companies to hire the workers they need.\nMigration Figures\nAccording to the latest figures, the Netherlands saw over 403,000 immigrants arrive in the country in 2022, while 179,000 emigrated – a net migration of 223,000. This marked a sharp rise from 2021 and the highest rate on record. The majority of 2022 migrants to the country came from other European nations (around 257,000 people), while the second-largest share (around 70,000) was from Asia. The figures show that 25,000 people came from Africa in 2022.\nForeign Policy and Defence Commitments\nOn foreign policy matters, the coalition parties have committed to keeping the Netherlands as a “constructive partner” in the EU and supporting Ukraine “politically, militarily, financially, and morally.” They have also pledged to make it legally binding to spend at least 2 percent of the Dutch gross domestic product on defence, in line with NATO agreements.\nControversial Jerusalem Embassy Move\nOne of the more controversial proposals in the coalition agreement is the plan to examine the possibility of moving the Dutch embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The agreement states, “Taking into account solutions to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and diplomatic interests, we will examine when the embassy can be moved to Jerusalem at an appropriate time.”\nWilders acknowledged that this move would take time, stating, “We are making a survey, so it’s not going to happen tomorrow… but I hope it will not be in a few years’ time either.”\nClimate Change and Energy Policies\nOn the issue of climate change, the coalition has stated that it will adhere to internationally agreed goals but will not impose any additional national restrictions on planet-warming emissions. Offshore gas production in the North Sea would be increased, while the government plans to proceed with the construction of four nuclear reactors in the coming decade.\nSpending Cuts and Financing\nTo finance their plans, the coalition has proposed 14 billion euros in spending cuts through 2028. These cuts include 2.5 billion euros in development aid, 1 billion euros on government salaries, and 100 million euros from the public broadcaster’s budget.\nCoalition Makeup and Leadership\nThe new coalition brings together Wilders’ PVV, outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s centre-right VVD, the new NSC party, and the farmers’ protest party BBB. Together, they hold a strong majority of 88 seats in the 150-seat Lower House.\nWhile the broad agreement has been reached, an independent intermediary, civil servant Richard van Zwol, has been appointed as the “formateur” to oversee the formation of the cabinet of ministers, a process expected to take at least another month.\nThe main contender for the role of Prime Minister appears to be former education and interior minister Ronald Plasterk, who played a key role in overseeing the initial talks.\nWilders’ Ambitions\nWilders himself has reluctantly agreed to give up his dream of becoming Prime Minister, amid widespread unease over his anti-Islam and anti-European views. However, since the election, support for the PVV and Wilders has only increased, according to surveys, as voters voice frustration at the slow pace of talks.\nIn a post earlier this year, Wilders declared, “Do not forget: I will become Prime Minister of the Netherlands one day. With the support of even more Dutch. If not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. Because the voices of millions of Dutch will be heard!”\nBacklash and Concerns\nThe rise of the far-right in the Netherlands has sparked backlash and concerns across the political spectrum. Wilders’ anti-Islam and anti-European rhetoric has been a source of controversy, and his party’s inclusion in the coalition has raised alarm bells among those concerned about the erosion of democratic values and human rights.\nCritics argue that the proposed asylum policies are draconian and violate international human rights conventions, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for other countries to follow. There are also concerns that the coalition’s hardline stance on immigration could exacerbate social tensions and fuel further polarisation within Dutch society.\nA Delicate Balancing Act\nAs the new Dutch government takes shape, it will face the delicate task of balancing its commitment to upholding the rule of law and human rights with the demands of its constituents for stricter immigration controls. The successful implementation of their policies will depend not only on navigating the complex legal and diplomatic landscape but also on fostering social cohesion and promoting a spirit of inclusivity and tolerance within the Netherlands.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-debanking-dilemma-uk-banks-close-over-1000-accounts-daily/content_1037.html": "The Debanking Dilemma – UK Banks Close Over 1000 Accounts Daily\nThe UK banking industry is facing a concerning trend as more than 1,000 accounts are closed every day, leaving customers bewildered and calling for greater transparency. The closure of over 343,000 accounts in 2021-22 has sparked outrage and raised questions about the reasons behind this growing phenomenon. Nigel Farage, a prominent figure in British politics, has called for a royal commission to investigate the matter, after his own account closure unveiled troubling revelations.\nBehind Closed Doors: The Veil of Secrecy\nWhen individuals or organizations have their bank accounts closed, they often receive scant or no explanation for the abrupt action taken by the banks. While some financial institutions cite concerns over financial crimes like money laundering and fraud as the reason, many customers remain in the dark about the true motivations behind their account termination.\nFarage’s Political Ordeal\nNigel Farage’s experience exposed the darker side of debanking. A subject access request revealed that his political views played a significant role in the closure of his account, despite initial denials by NatWest subsidiary Coutts. This revelation triggered a domino effect, leading to the resignation of Dame Alison Rose, the chief executive of NatWest Group, and Peter Flavel, chief executive of Coutts. Farage has called for further accountability, urging Sir Howard Davies, chair of NatWest Group, to step aside as well.\nPressure Mounts for Explanation\nThe release of new data on account closures has intensified scrutiny on NatWest, Coutts, and other banks in the industry. There is a growing demand for banks to offer clear explanations to those affected and be transparent about their actions. In response, Farage and several other right-wing figures have called for a swift royal commission to hold banks accountable.\nOrdinary Lives Affected: The Human Toll\nThe debanking crisis extends far beyond the political realm. Ordinary individuals and small businesses across the country have fallen victim to account closures, leading to fear, distress, and ruined lives. Thousands of businesses have been forced to shut down, leaving innocent individuals suffering the consequences without any apparent wrongdoing.\nThe Politically Exposed Persons Quandary\nThe issue takes a political turn when individuals, including politicians and their families, are denied access to banking services due to being classified as “politically exposed persons.” Approximately 90,000 people have faced this categorization, resulting in rejections by banks. This situation has drawn attention to the potential abuse of positions for personal gain.\nA Call for Intervention\nThe debanking crisis transcends political divisions. Both anti-Brexit and pro-Brexit groups have reported similar problems, indicating that this is a broader issue requiring immediate attention. Gina Miller, an anti-Brexit campaigner, has called on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the government to intervene and ensure new parties and MPs have access to banking services.\nThe Struggle for Financial Inclusivity\nIndividuals have faced debanking for various reasons, including holding legal cryptocurrency or gambling accounts or engaging in international transactions. These account closures have affected not only UK-born citizens but also foreign-born individuals.\nA Glimmer of Hope: Proposed Changes\nThe government has acknowledged the urgency of the situation and announced plans to change rules surrounding bank account closures. These proposed changes include requiring banks to provide longer notice before shutting down accounts. However, significant challenges remain, as some banks are legally prevented from disclosing the reasons for account closures.\nThe Road Ahead: Seeking Resolution\nAs the number of closed accounts continues to rise, the call for greater transparency and accountability grows louder. A comprehensive investigation, as suggested by the proposed royal commission, may provide much-needed clarity and pave the way for reforms to protect individuals from unjust debanking. In a country where financial inclusivity should be paramount, it is essential to ensure that everyone has access to fair and transparent banking services, regardless of their political affiliations or financial circumstances.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_hotels-in-cyprus-pushing-for-airbnb-legislation/content_130.html": "The Cyprus Hotel Association is pressing MPs to pass a bill regulating Airbnb type rentals that has been on the table for nearly a year to combat what hoteliers consider as unfair competition.\nCYPRUS PROPERTY NEWS REPROTS: HOTELIERS are pressing for legislation to be introduced that would regulate tourist accommodation booked via sites like Airbnb, as they deem it ‘unfair competition’.\nWith competition between hotels and Airbnb accommodation in Cyprus on the rise, the Cyprus Hotel Association (CHA) is calling on MPs to pass a bill which has been on the table since May 2018. The proposed legislation tabled by ruling DISY leader Averof Neophytou and EDEK MP Elias Myrianthous want Airbnb-listed accommodation included on a register, subjected to tax, while obligated to undergo health and safety inspections.\nCypriot MPs told the Financial Mirror that they are aware of the urgency of the matter and are “putting the final touches to the legislation before bringing it before the plenary”. The bill is currently being discussed at the House Commerce Committee, with MPs scrutinising the finer details. “An issue raised by fellow MPs who argued that apartments on platforms such as Airbnb, could only be included on an official register if owners have the approval of other residents in the building, has been overcome.\n“We have agreed on a formula with which owners of such flats will need the consent of the building’s management committee, before letting them out,” Myrianthous said.\nHe said the legislation will enable the state to monitor and perform health and safety checks on these types of accommodations, while owners will be subjected to tax. EDEK’s Myrianthous had said in October, that the state is losing revenue that it could receive through licensing rights stressing that some 40,000 properties are not licensed. He noted that there are around 20,000 illegal villas and dwellings, with most owners interested in acquiring a license. According to official data, hotel beds in Cyprus amount to 83,000. It is estimated that one-third of tourists arriving in Cyprus seek accommodation in non-registered units.\nTalking to the Financial Mirror, Zacharias Ioannides, director general of the Cyprus Hotel Association said that legislation must go ahead as soon as possible as hotels have made serious investments. According to data provided by the land registry in October, new hotels, refurbishments and expansion projects have multiplied by eight times in the first seven months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. From January to July 2018, hotel projects covering 83,000 square meters were licensed, compared to just 10,000 sqm in 2017 – the 730% increase also accounts for one-third of the licenses for new building projects.\n“Expected investments in the hotel industry include the construction of new hotel units island-wide while existing hotels have increased their bed capacity and upgraded their services,” said Ioannides.\nHe said that investments in question were made in order to meet demand created by the increase in the number of tourists arriving in Cyprus, however, hoteliers feel that owners of apartments should be on a level playing field. “Hoteliers who have significantly invested in upgrading their product and pay a significant amount of taxes to the state are currently subjected to strict regulations, while Airbnb has been excluded so far from these obligations,” Ioannides told the Financial Mirror. Global trend Acknowledging that accommodation options offered by platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com are a global trend, Ioannides added that the market should, however, be regulated so as to do away with unfair competition especially at a time when Cyprus tourism is under pressure from rival destinations. He argued that regulating the Airbnb market is also important as it would introduce safety and health checks for accommodation which currently is not obliged to follow any rules. “Currently Airbnb is not subjected to any kind of control, which may endanger the health of tourists, and in turn endanger the good name of Cyprus’ tourism product. A name which the tourist industry on the island has fought for years to build.” Chrisemily Psilogeni, President of the Association of Cyprus Tourist Enterprises said they have been campaigning for the legislation as there will be control over “residencies which are currently operating illegally, without any license and not subject to any checks, causing damage to our tourist product, while depriving income from the Cypriot economy.”\n“We are not opposed to modern trends, but we claim legitimacy and defend the rights of hundreds of businesses that have been working for decades under adverse conditions, trying to maintain a high standard in the tourist services,” said Psilogeni.\nMeanwhile, Airbnb has the potential to benefit Cyprus tourism says an academic who has been monitoring the platform’s performance in Cyprus. UCLAN lecturer in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fanos Tekelas said that while the island’s tourism is under pressure from competition from cheaper destinations in the region such as Turkey and Egypt, tourist accommodations promoted on platforms such as Airbnb can attract tourists who prefer to spend more on activities during their holidays rather than on accommodation. “We are not a cheap destination. There are no sponsored packages for tourists heading for Cyprus, while other destinations in the region have cheaper airfares and lower accommodation costs,” explained Tekelas.\nUnderstanding that this type of accommodation is in competition with hotels who have spent millions in renovations and upgrades, Tekelas said that tourists opting for Airbnb accommodation, are not attracted by five-star hotels, but rather are looking to spend their time and money creatively. “On the negative side of things, a number of Airbnb accommodation owners live overseas, and that might not only pose as a tax challenge but also see revenue otherwise set to stay within the country, find its way abroad. The only way to totally do away with tax evasion and loss of revenue is to ban such platforms in Cyprus entirely. That I believe would prove disastrous for our tourism,” said the UCLan lecturer.\nAcknowledging that owners of such accommodation have a lot of scope for tax evasion, Tekelas suggested that all such accommodation should be subjected to a yearly license fee, rather than being taxed on the number of tourists accommodated or rooms. According to the Airbnb platform, visitors who used short-term lettings in Cyprus reached 120,000 from 125 different countries in 2017-2018, while this number is expected to rise significantly.\nCOMMENT\nAirbnb has revolutionised the way that people are travelling, finding accommodation and even the type of accommodation the seek. It has never been easier to search for a large property for a large party, or to find a remote Cottage, not to mention the impact it has had on those wishing to make their properties available for rent. Those wishing to spend some or most of their time away from home, are now able to receive an income from their property, without the risks of a longer term tenant.\nThe competition from Airbnb is also a good thing as it keeps other forms of accommodation, such as Hotels looking over their should and making more effort, which is good for everyone. However, as usual, people at the top of any industry, always want to pull up the ladder and prevent competition, which should not be a reason to introduce legislation.\nOne factor that could and should be implemented for Airbnb providers is compulsory public liability insurance. As it stands, Airbnb does not enforce this, even if it gets a mention in the Terms and Conditions, it must be MANDATORY, it must be with an ACCREDITED INSURER and it should be produced PRIOR to any bookings being taken.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-old-larnaca-airport/content_372.html": "History\nLarnaca Airport was hastily developed towards the end of 1974 after the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey on 20 July of the same year, which forced the closure of Nicosia International Airport. The site on which it was built (near the Larnaca Salt Lake), had been previously used as an airfield in the 1930s and, subsequently, as a military installation by the British forces.\nLarnaca International opened on 8 February 1975, with only limited infrastructure facilities and a prefabricated set of buildings comprising separate halls for departures and arrivals. The first airlines to use the new airport were Cyprus Airways using Viscount 800s leased from British Midland and Olympic Airways using NAMC YS-11s. Initially, the runway at Larnaca International was too short for jet aircraft.\nThe old airport was operating from 8th February 1975 until the 7th November 2009 when the new terminal opened.\nNobody who has travelled to Larnaca in the last 40 years would not feel sentimental at the sight of this airport. Even though the new terminal is stunning, this old airport was the quintessential Cypriot airport.\nThe old Taxi office was the usual point of contact with cab drivers who used to hang around here playing Tavli, drinking coffee and generally making a Cypriot nuisance of themselves!\nThe terminal was gradually improved over the years, but as the number of visitors grew, the terminal was eventually bursting at the seams and eventually a new terminal was needed.\nDeal for development of old Larnaca airport signed\nAfter the new terminal opened, the old terminal sat there unused (apart from being used as a private terminal for visiting heads of state, VIPs, and private aircraft operators.\nThere was a FANTASTIC deal on the table in 2012, a Chinese investor was going to invest FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS to develop the old airport and the deal was even reported as having been signed, but the Cypriot Government dithered so much in their response that the investor pulled out….so the old terminal continues to sit there as a souvenir of the past for the foreseeable future.\n(News article from 23rd March 2012)\nThe Island’s airport operator Hermes signed a multi-million Euro deal with Chinese company Far Eastern Phoenix early this morning for the redevelopment of the old Larnaca airport facility.\n(The proposal video for the development of the old terminal)",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_labours-surrender-to-the-foes-of-free-expression/content_939.html": "Labour’s Surrender to the Foes of Free Expression\nA Disturbing Turn of Events\nIn a deeply concerning development, merely three weeks into the tenure of the new Labour Government, we find ourselves confronted with yet another alarming decision that has been surreptitiously implemented without proper scrutiny. This time, the very cornerstone of our democratic society – the right to free speech – is under threat. The newly appointed Education Secretary has taken the drastic step of halting the progress of the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act, with the ominous intention of considering its complete repeal.\nThe manner in which this decision was unveiled is, in itself, a cause for grave concern. Unless one happens to be a devoted campaigner in the realm of free speech, this momentous shift in policy would have likely escaped notice. The announcement was discreetly tucked away at the conclusion of a written statement, buried deep within the labyrinthine Parliament website. There was a conspicuous absence of debate in the chamber, no opportunity for Members of Parliament to subject the decision to rigorous examination, and not even a perfunctory press release to inform the public. The irony of this clandestine approach to a matter of such paramount importance as free speech is not lost on those who value open discourse.\nAs the minister who spearheaded this crucial legislation, I can attest to its vital importance in safeguarding the freedom of expression for both academics and students within our esteemed universities. Throughout the process of crafting and implementing this act, we faced relentless opposition from the Labour Party. Their priorities appeared to be woefully misplaced, seemingly more preoccupied with the administrative workload of university staff than with the pressing needs of students and academics whose fundamental right to free speech had been systematically eroded.\nThe consequences of this erosion have been far-reaching and profoundly disturbing. We have witnessed the arbitrary cancellation of speaking events, the capricious withdrawal of university placements, and in the most egregious cases, the utter ruination of promising careers. What heinous offence could have precipitated such draconian measures? The answer is as simple as it is chilling: these individuals had the temerity to express views that, while neither hateful nor illegal, were deemed merely controversial.\nThis pattern of behaviour should not come as a surprise to those who have been paying attention. The worldview espoused by the radical Left is one in which the very notion of debate is anathema. A cursory examination of recent history reveals a troubling trend. Those who dared to question whether the sanctity of vulnerable women’s spaces should be preserved were summarily branded as bigots. Individuals who raised legitimate concerns about the fairness of imposing the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) tax on those with the most limited financial means were dismissively labelled as flat-earthers. Perhaps most disturbingly, those who had the audacity to inquire whether the prolonged lockdowns might have inflicted lasting harm on the mental well-being of our children were callously accused of being ‘granny killers’.\nLabour cannot obfuscate their true nature – they are a party so deeply entrenched in the insular politics of student unions that their instinctive response to any challenging issue is not to engage in reasoned debate, but to summarily silence the opposition.\nOur Freedom of Speech Act was meticulously crafted to address these concerns. It introduced a robust framework of accountability for universities regarding the state of free speech on their campuses. Moreover, it empowered academics, students, and invited speakers with the legal right to seek redress through the courts if their rights were unjustly infringed upon. A cornerstone of the Act was the creation of a new role – that of a free speech director, vested with the legal obligation to safeguard free speech and investigate instances of ‘no-platforming’ at universities.\nDuring the legislative process, I was profoundly disturbed by the myriad accounts of those who had fallen victim to the pernicious influences of cancel culture and self-censorship that have insidiously permeated our academic institutions. One particularly troubling case involved a group of mathematicians who found themselves under intense pressure to ‘decolonise’ their curriculum. This misguided initiative sought to suppress the work of ‘white mathematicians’ while artificially elevating that of ‘non-white mathematicians’ – a clear example of discrimination masquerading as progress. The sentiment expressed by these beleaguered academics was one I encountered with distressing frequency: “We are paralysed by fear, unable to speak out due to the very real threat of backlash that could jeopardise our livelihoods.”\nThe stark reality is that Labour politicians appear to be in a state of denial regarding the magnitude of this issue. More alarmingly, they seem to have adopted the view that free speech is not a principle worth defending. In a recent statement to the BBC, the Education Secretary boldly proclaimed that the ‘culture wars’ on campus would ‘end here’. This declaration betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation. The true instigators of these ‘culture wars’ are not those who advocate for open and free debate on divisive ideologies. Rather, they are the radical activist groups on the Left who, in their misguided sense of moral superiority, believe that their personal convictions should trump the right of others to disagree. It requires an astounding level of delusion to accuse those who merely seek to maintain mainstream opinion of fomenting culture wars.\nThis mindset represents the gravest threat posed by the Labour Party. Their agenda is one of radical transformation, yet they seek to implement it without the inconvenience of debate or dissent. It is precisely this belief in the fundamental right to pose difficult questions and express challenging ideas that forms the bedrock of my Conservative convictions.\nThe left’s ideological inclinations have already led to dire consequences. We have seen vulnerable children placed at risk due to the demands of activist organisations such as Stonewall. If left unchecked, this approach will inevitably lead to a wholesale rewriting of our rich and complex history. Furthermore, it threatens to usher in an ideologically driven approach to achieving net-zero carbon emissions that could potentially impoverish our nation. If we fail to stand firm in defence of our right to question and challenge, the trajectory upon which Labour may lead us is truly alarming.\nIn conclusion, the decision to halt and potentially repeal the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act represents a significant backward step in the protection of academic freedom and open discourse in our society. It is imperative that we remain vigilant and continue to champion the cause of free speech, even in the face of opposition from those who would seek to silence dissenting voices. The future of our democratic society and the integrity of our academic institutions hang in the balance. We must not allow the enemies of free speech to prevail, lest we find ourselves in a world where the exchange of ideas is stifled, and the pursuit of truth is subordinated to ideological conformity.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-tax-system-explained-with-beer/content_842.html": "The Tax System Explained With Beer\nSuppose that once a week, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to £100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this.\nThe first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.\nThe fifth would pay £1.\nThe sixth would pay £3.\nThe seventh would pay £7.\nThe eighth would pay £12.\nThe ninth would pay £18\nAnd the tenth man (the richest) would pay £59.\nSo, that’s what they decided to do. The ten men drank in the bar every week and seemed quite happy with the arrangement until, one day, the owner caused them a little problem. “Since you are all such good customers,” he said, “I’m going to reduce the cost of your weekly beer by £20.” Drinks for the ten men would now cost just £80.\nThe group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free but what about the other six men? The paying customers? How could they divide the £20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share?\nThey realized that £20 divided by six is £3.33 but if they subtracted that from everybody’s share then not only would the first four men still be drinking for free but the fifth and sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.\nSo, the bar owner suggested that it would be fairer to reduce each man’s bill by a higher percentage. They decided to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.\nAnd so, the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (a 100% saving).\nThe sixth man now paid £2 instead of £3 (a 33% saving).\nThe seventh man now paid £5 instead of £7 (a 28% saving).\nThe eighth man now paid £9 instead of £12 (a 25% saving).\nThe ninth man now paid £14 instead of £18 (a 22% saving).\nAnd the tenth man now paid £49 instead of £59 (a 16% saving).\nEach of the last six was better off than before with the first four continuing to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings. “I only got £1 out of the £20 saving,” declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man, “but he got £10”\n“Yes, that’s right,” exclaimed the fifth man. “I only saved £1 too. It’s unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me”\n“That’s true” shouted the seventh man. “Why should he get £10 back, when I only got £2? The wealthy get all the breaks”\n“Wait a minute,” yelled the first four men in unison, “We didn’t get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor”\nThe nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.\nThe next week the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important – they didn’t have enough money between all of them to pay for even half of the bill.\nAnd that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy and they just might not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.\nFor those who understand, no explanation is needed.\nFor those who do not understand, no explanation is possible.\n(source: unknown)\nComment\nIn the UK, the top 10% paid 35% of all income tax in the late seventies, today it is over 60%. Whilst this is a simplified example, it nevertheless remains a fact that if we make the climate unfavourable to the wealthy, they will simply pay less tax, or worse still, leave the country and head for one of the many low tax nations that would willingly welcome them.\nIt is down to the government to ensure that there are incentives for the rotation of money, rather than for it to simply be ‘parked’ where it is not benefiting others. If a large sum were invested in a certain area, it not only reduces the burden on the poorest people by reducing the pressure on them, but there is also the ‘multiplication factor’ which is the additional wealth that is created by that investment, as it works its way around the local economy.\nRaising taxes beyond the acceptable norm, that is the amount that most people or businesses consider acceptable in the current climate, and this is now lower than it was a few years ago, because more nations have reduced their personal and corporate tax rates. This is the ‘Laffer Curve’ in practice.\nIf just 3/4% of the highest tax payers were to leave for another country, the exchequer would be in serious trouble. We must encourage less tax from more activity, rather than more tax from less activity, if we are going to reduce the burden on everyone.",

Throughout history, we have witnessed countless instances where the failure to prepare has led to catastrophic consequences. Rather than taking precautionary measures, humanity has consistently demonstrated a predilection for merely hoping circumstances will turn out favourably. Whilst this approach occasionally proves successful, more often than not, it results in dire consequences.\nOne cannot claim ignorance in the face of clear warnings. Donald Trump has never attempted to obscure his evident sympathies towards Vladimir Putin. His campaign pledge to resolve the Ukrainian conflict has been a consistent feature of his presidential aspirations, and he has repeatedly admonished fellow NATO members about their perceived parasitic relationship with America, urging them to shoulder a greater portion of their defence responsibilities.\nNevertheless, the spectacle of Trump actually implementing his stated policies has caught European leaders entirely wrong-footed. They find themselves in an embarrassingly vulnerable position, grotesquely unprepared for the severe security challenges that Trump’s actions present. Having shamelessly exploited the post-Cold War “peace dividend”, they now stand exposed and defenceless before the gathering storm.\nMuch to the Kremlin’s unbridled delight, Trump’s America has effectively switched allegiances. The long-standing bonds of the Western alliance have been all but severed in favour of sacrificing Ukraine’s interests. Trump now regularly parrots Russian propaganda with troubling enthusiasm – propagating such dubious claims as Volodymyr Zelensky being a dictator with merely 4 per cent popular support, and the patently false assertion that America’s military aid to Ukraine significantly outweighs European contributions.\nAssuming Trump’s declarations reflect genuine intent, we stand on the precipice of one of the most significant geopolitical upheavals of the modern era. We are witnessing a dramatic deviation from the post-war settlement that has underpinned international relations for decades.\nThe dangers facing Europe could scarcely be more apparent. Putin, emboldened by his territorial acquisitions in Ukraine, appears poised to expand his imperial ambitions towards the Baltic states and other regions of Eastern Europe. There is little evidence to suggest that Trump would be inclined to defend Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia in such circumstances.\nWhilst one ought not to draw direct parallels between geopolitical developments and financial markets, the current juxtaposition presents a remarkable spectacle – American and European stock indices hover near their historic peaks, with valuations stretched to seemingly unsustainable levels.\nEuropean political leaders are not alone in their lack of preparation for adverse scenarios; markets appear equally oblivious to looming threats. The sole apparent indicator of trouble manifests in the gold price, which likewise approaches its historic zenith, albeit for markedly different reasons. Gold has long served as the ultimate safe haven during periods of uncertainty.\nThe surge in demand has placed considerable strain on the Bank of England’s capabilities. Requests for bullion shipment slots have reached their highest levels in decades. Such is the volume that Sir Dave Ramsden, one of the Bank’s deputy governors, recently found his commute impeded by a lorry in the bullion yard awaiting its cargo of gold bars.\nThe Bank of England maintains its position as the world’s second-largest gold depository, surpassed only by the New York Federal Reserve. However, it is worth noting that merely 5.4 per cent of the 420,000 gold bars housed within the Bank’s vaults actually belong to the nation. The remainder is held on behalf of commercial entities and other central banks.\nThis modest national holding might have been more substantial were it not for Gordon Brown’s inexplicable decision to dispose of a significant portion of the nation’s gold reserves at historically low prices during the late 1990s – a decision that continues to perplex financial analysts to this day.\nSince Trump’s election to the presidency, more than 20 million troy ounces of gold, valued at approximately £47 billion, have been transferred to New York’s Comex exchange depositories, with a substantial portion originating from the London gold market. This robust demand has created opportunities for arbitrage between spot and futures prices. Additionally, traders harbour concerns regarding potential Trumpian tariffs on gold shipments.\nHowever, underlying this modern gold rush lies a more profound catalyst – the unmistakable sight of the established world order being shaken to its very foundations.\nStock markets, conversely, appear to maintain an almost Panglossian outlook regarding the future. Rather than recognising the Carthaginian peace likely to be imposed upon Zelensky for what it truly represents – a component of a perilous deterioration in international relations – they appear inclined to view it, much like Trump, as a potential escape route from an otherwise interminable war of attrition.\nThe markets appear to believe that normalised relations with Russia could lead to the restoration of regular trade patterns, alleviating pressure on European budgets, enhancing business opportunities, and reopening access to affordable energy resources.\nFrom the White House’s perspective, Zelensky bears significant responsibility for recent developments. According to reports, he had previously indicated to the United States his willingness to concede mineral rights as part of a security arrangement underpinning a peace agreement.\nScott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, recently elaborated on this point during a Bloomberg TV interview: “The sequencing of what was going to happen was: bring the Ukrainians closer to the US through economic ties, convince the American people, the American public, get them onside. The US, with greater economic interest in Ukraine, provides a security shield.”\nHowever, Bessent contends that Zelensky subsequently reneged on this arrangement and made what were deemed “inappropriate remarks” at the Munich Security Conference. “He assured me that he would sign the minerals deal, but he has not,” Bessent maintained.\nRegardless of the precise details, relations between the United States and the remainder of the G7 have deteriorated substantially. Sir Keir Starmer’s prospects of ameliorating this situation during his scheduled meeting with Trump appear decidedly slim.\nThe Prime Minister represents yet another relatively insignificant player on this grand stage. His modestly ambitious pledge to increase defence spending from 2.33 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent falls so far short of Trump’s demands as to appear almost disrespectful.\nLike many European leaders, Starmer appears not to have fully grasped the gravity of the situation. The threat posed by Putin necessitates not only substantially increased funding but a comprehensive reimagining of defence budget allocation, with particular emphasis on shifting resources from naval to land-based capabilities. Meanwhile, the Government continues to demonstrate dangerous complacency in the face of mounting threats.\nThe old adage suggests one cannot have both guns and butter, yet when presented with this choice, Europe consistently prioritises welfare spending. This paradigm has become obsolete, though politicians remain reluctant to acknowledge this reality.\nThis misapprehension extends beyond the political sphere. Current stock market valuations appear to reflect a bygone era, eerily reminiscent of another historical parallel. In the early summer of 1914, as war drums grew increasingly audible, markets maintained their complacent optimism, with prices remaining near historic peaks.\nIt was not until mobilisation began in earnest that investors finally recognised their precarious position. The ensuing panic proved so severe that stock markets worldwide suspended trading for extended periods, whilst in Britain, the entire banking system required nationalisation to prevent complete collapse.\nThe parallels with our present situation are both striking and deeply troubling, suggesting that both political leaders and financial markets may be sleepwalking towards another potentially catastrophic failure of preparation.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_europe-is-becoming-increasingly-irrelevant-on-the-world-stage/content_240.html": "Europe is becoming increasingly irrelevant on the world stage\nEurope’s Economic Evolution: Unraveling Challenges and Charting a Course for Renewal\nOver the last two decades, a seismic shift has unfolded across Europe’s economic landscape, igniting concerns about the continent’s economic trajectory. Rewind to the year 2000, and you’ll find 41 European companies among the world’s top 100 global giants. Fast forward to the present, and that number has dramatically dwindled to a meager 15. Europe’s economic prowess appears to be fading, sparking inquiries into its ability to compete, innovate, and recalibrate its position in the ever-changing global economic theater. In this blog post, we embark on an exploratory journey into the myriad factors that have catalyzed Europe’s economic challenges and ponder the potential avenues for reinvigoration.\nA Historical Snapshot: Europe’s Ascendance and Industrial Revolution\nThe foundation of comprehending Europe’s economic narrative requires a retrospective glance through the annals of history. Contrary to popular belief, the era of Western economic supremacy is a relatively recent phenomenon. Prior to the 18th century, economic disparities between regions were remarkably marginal. Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, and North America shared comparable economic trajectories. However, the Industrial Revolution emerged as a transformative force, propelling Europe into an epoch of unparalleled technological innovation. The mechanization of production, birth of factories, and harnessing of steam engines catalyzed a new wave of productivity, steering Europe towards an unprecedented growth trajectory.\nConcomitant with this economic surge, Europe embarked on a phase of colonial expansion, solidifying its global dominance. Although colonialism didn’t singularly bestow riches upon Europe, the wealth generated through industrialization facilitated imperial conquests, further amplifying the continent’s economic clout.\nIn the 1960s europe together made up more than a third of the global economy today it’s less than 15% and falling!\nShifting Sands: Challenges and Indicators of Europe’s Economic Dilemma\nPost-World War II, Europe’s economic landscape underwent a seismic transformation. With former colonies securing their independence, Europe’s share of the global GDP commenced a gradual decline. What once constituted over a third of the global economy has withered to less than 15% today. This phenomenon has precipitated an era of economic stagnation, characterized by three pronounced indicators.\nFirstly, Europe’s corporate behemoths are grappling to keep stride with their international peers. A comparative assessment of revenue growth illustrates that American and Chinese corporations are advancing at an impressive clip, while European counterparts languish behind. European banking giants like BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank are confronting revenue contractions, in stark contrast to their American peer, J.P. Morgan, which has consistently expanded.\nSecondly, Europe’s economic powerhouses are ensconced in sectors that face imminent upheaval. European giants Shell and BP dominate the oil and gas sector, while the United States and China surge ahead in technology and retail. Given the global thrust towards sustainability, industries dependent on fossil fuels encounter formidable challenges.\nThirdly, Europe’s innovation engine appears to be sputtering. Not a solitary European tech company stands shoulder-to-shoulder with titans like Amazon or Apple. SAP, Europe’s most prominent tech entity, pales in comparison to its American and Chinese counterparts, shedding light on Europe’s innovation deficit.\nObstacles to Innovation: Regulatory Quandaries and Fragmented Markets\nEurope’s struggle with innovation can be traced to two key factors. Firstly, excessive regulations have become a stumbling block. While regulations are indispensable for safeguarding diverse interests, an excess of regulations can stifle business agility, investments, and competition. Europe’s position as a regulatory trendsetter often results in the establishment of innovation-restricting standards. Secondly, despite the existence of the European Union (EU), individual member states retain distinct regulations, creating a fragmented market. European enterprises encounter impediments while endeavoring to expand across borders, constraining their growth potential.\nCharting the Path Forward: Navigating Challenges and Fostering Innovation\nEurope’s challenges are formidable, but they are not insurmountable. Striking a balance between essential regulations and cultivating innovation is the crux of the solution. Streamlining bureaucratic processes without compromising safety and quality could infuse new dynamism into business growth. Additionally, harmonizing regulations across EU member states can engender a more cohesive market, fostering cross-border competition and innovation.\nTo counteract the sway of industries tethered to fossil fuels, Europe must pivot decisively towards sustainable alternatives. Investing in renewable energy and technologies aligned with global sustainability goals can position European firms as frontrunners in a rapidly transforming market.\nCompetition serves as a crucible for innovation. European firms must reignite their ardor for success by setting their sights on global dominance, rather than contenting themselves with national or regional markets. Europe’s success hinges on nurturing innovative startups that can measure up to American and Chinese counterparts.\nIn Conclusion: An Imperative for Europe’s Future\nIn the face of shifting economic tides and global transformations, Europe finds itself at a crucial juncture. The challenges it confronts are multifaceted, but they offer opportunities for renewal and growth. As we wrap up this exploration of Europe’s economic trajectory, let’s distill the key takeaways into a concise set of bullet points:\n– **Historical Context:** Europe’s economic ascendancy was a recent phenomenon, catalyzed by the Industrial Revolution and colonial expansion.\n– **Current Landscape:** Europe’s share of the global GDP has dwindled significantly, raising concerns about its future economic relevance.\n– **Indicators of Concern:** Three main indicators signal Europe’s economic challenges:\n– European corporations are struggling to keep pace with their global counterparts.\n– European companies are often entrenched in sectors facing transformational shifts, such as oil and gas.\n– Europe lags behind in tech innovation compared to giants like the US and China.\n– **Obstacles to Innovation:**\n– Excessive regulations hamper business agility and innovation potential.\n– Fragmented markets within the EU hinder cross-border expansion and competition.\n– **Path Forward:**\n– Balancing regulation and innovation is essential to nurture a dynamic business environment.\n– Embracing sustainable alternatives is imperative to counteract challenges posed by fossil fuel reliance.\n– Cultivating innovation through startups and fostering a competitive mindset can rejuvenate Europe’s economic landscape.\n– **Crucial Choices Ahead:**\n– Europe faces a pivotal decision – to adapt, innovate, and compete on a global scale, or risk economic marginalization.\n– **Urgent Action Required:**\n– The time for Europe to act is now, by harmonizing regulations, championing sustainability, and fostering innovation.\n– **Reinvigoration Potential:**\n– Despite the challenges, Europe possesses the resources, talent, and historical legacy to reshape its economic destiny.\n– **Legacy in the Balance:**\n– Europe’s success in navigating these challenges will determine its legacy as an economic powerhouse in the 21st century.\nAs Europe stands on the cusp of transformation, the choices it makes in the coming years will reverberate across generations. By embracing innovation, streamlining regulations, and positioning sustainability at the forefront, Europe has the potential to reassert itself as a formidable economic force in an ever-evolving global landscape.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_hertzs-costly-misstep-with-electric-vehicles/content_208.html": "Hertz’s Costly Misstep with Electric Vehicles\nIntroduction\nCar rental giant Hertz recently took a $45 million loss after an attempt to go green by buying 20,000 electric vehicles backfired. The company had hoped to position itself as an environmentally conscious option for renters, but failed to consider customers’ practical needs and preferences. This case illustrates some of the ongoing challenges with wide-scale EV adoption.\nThe Motivation\nIn 2020, Hertz set an ambitious goal to electrify one-quarter of its fleet, amounting to 20,000 vehicles. This formed part of a wider corporate push towards more climate-friendly practices. However, while the motivation was commendable in theory, there were clearly flaws in the strategy and execution.\nThe Problem\nUltimately, the reason this initiative failed comes down to customer demand, or lack thereof. Most Hertz renters pick the company because they need to travel moderate to long distances. This could be for business trips, touring holidays, or other reasons. The range limitations and long charging times associated with EVs make them poorly suited to these use cases currently.\nRenters expect to be able to quickly refuel and be on their way. But finding an available charger, then having to wait potentially hours for an adequate charge, is simply not feasible or appealing when they are trying to make the most of limited rental time.\nThe Financial Loss\nAs a result of insufficient demand, Hertz has been forced to write off $45 million on the underutilized EVs. On top of the high original sticker price, maintenance costs for EVs are also more significant than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.\nOf course, Hertz deserves credit for making an effort towards sustainability, even if the business case did not stack up on this occasion. Nonetheless, they failed to fully consider the practical impediments from a customer standpoint.\nWider Adoption Challenges\nThis situation speaks to ongoing teething issues with EV adoption more broadly. There is still anxiety among some drivers around range, charging infrastructure availability, battery lifespan and other factors. Brands like Hertz need to lead public education efforts to overcome these, rather than putting the cart before the horse.\nThere also remain large upfront cost barriers to EV ownership for many. Hertz may have thought rentals could serve as a ‘gateway’, sparking interest that converts to future sales. But a rental experience is often not reflective of actual ownership, so this was overly optimistic.\nGovernment Quotas\nHertz’s losses come against the backdrop of looming government zero-emission vehicle quotas internationally. By 2026, carmakers in Europe will need to ensure a quarter of new sales are electric. And from 2035, all new cars sold in the EU must be zero emissions.\nProponents argue these mandates will force down EV costs through economies of scale. However, critics see them as an unwanted nanny-state incursion on personal choice. There are also doubts over whether charging infrastructure can keep pace.\nIf targets are adhered to rigidly without flexibility, they risk leaving many unable to afford private transport in the long term. This takes freedom of mobility away from the average citizen. Wealthy elites with the means to own new EVs will not face the same restrictions.\nRethinking Green Credentials\nSo while Hertz’s initiatives came from an admirable place of wanting to reduce environmental impact, the execution was clearly misguided. This is emblematic of a wider tendency for ‘green posturing’ from brands, without substantiating real-world benefits.\nIn fact, there is a distinct irony that EVs are still so reliant on unethically-sourced battery minerals, often using child labour in unsafe conditions. Each new vehicle sold intensifies demand for scarce cobalt and lithium reserves. This troubling supply chain dynamic damages the industry’s ecological credentials.\nConclusion\n– Hertz attempted to go green by buying 20,000 EVs, but failed to adequately consider customer needs and preferences\n– Renters expect to travel moderate-long distances, but range limitations and charging logistics currently make EVs ill-suited\n– Initiative backfired spectacularly, costing Hertz $45 million in losses from low utilization rates\n– Points to ongoing adoption challenges around factors like range anxiety and infrastructure gaps\n– Government EV quotas looming, but critics argue this removes choice and affordability\n– Supply chain ethics issues persist around unsafe mining of battery minerals\n– Brands must move past superficial green marketing to substantiate real benefits\n– More public education needed on EVs, alongside flexibility and openness on path to sustainability\n– Heavy-handed policies that restrict options likely counterproductive\nUltimately, the Hertz case offers some salient lessons. Customer sentiment still indicates EVs have limitations that automakers and governments have been slow to acknowledge. Quotas and targets are meaningless without adequate public buy-in. And superficial green marketing ploys can quickly backfire and cost companies dearly.\nMore openness, education and choice is needed on the road towards sustainable transport. The poor optics of dying children mining EV battery materials also requires urgent attention. But heavy-handed policies that take options away from citizens do more harm than good.\nlet them enjoy the loss… well done Hertz.\nlet them enjoy the loss… well done Hertz.",

Everybody supports a cleaner environment, cleaner air, but anything can be done if it is done gradually, if car manufacturers knew that the vehicles they produce today would be banned from the roads in major cities within five years, and that motorists will not buy them, they will ensure that next month or next year their vehicles would be cleaner and then cleaner and then cleaner.\nWhatever method they use, that’s down to them it shouldn’t be for the government to dictate how you do things, the government should just literally set goals that are logical, along with a time frame and a pathway to those goals so everybody knows where they stand, not just to enforce knee-jerk laws especially when this ULEZ law is not even coming from government, it is coming from a arrogant, power-hungry Mayor, who have has his own personal agenda.\nHe should not only be stopped, he should be booted out of office, that’s my opinion I feel very strongly about it and I’d love to hear your thoughts on the matter.\nResponse to Comments\nhttps://youtu.be/quYLsJZ6Oy0\nBefore I move on to anything else, I feel that I need to reply to one or two of the comments that were made on my video about ULEZ being a scam, namely somebody commented “why don’t you just go and buy a new car?”\nI don’t know if this guy was just joking, or if he was really serious, but there are thousands of people out there who can’t afford to buy a newer car, or maybe they don’t want to, why should they?\nThere are two important phrases that I would point out to you, and I will cover each of them in detail the first one being, ‘moving the goal post’ and the second being ‘legal, political and social precedent’\nWith regard to moving the goal post, history has taught us that political movement is dynamic, it is never moved to this point, make this change and stop, it is always a direction and any change of direction , which means that politics or the direction of the government or leadership at the time, has changed towards a certain goal, just as when they introduced ULEZ within the inner Central London Zone, we knew that they would expand further, and they now they plan to expand even further.\nI went down to London yesterday and I spoke to a few people who live on the peripherals of the M25, on the inner side of the M25 people are worried about the effect on their businesses, on the outside of the M25 people are worried about how they are going to live when it’s going to cost them £12.50 at the current prices, just to cross over onto the other side of the M25, and this is not the end of it!\nWe allowed this to begin and it will go further and further and further, and less we make our voices heard enough to stop this now!\nAs far as legal and political precedent goes, many of you may have not noticed the dramatic changes that we have faced over the last few decades. There have been incremental changes, but they are without doubt very, very significant and future history will confirm that the last three or four decades have been a time of political and legal Revolution.\nMany of you may remember in the early 90s there was an IRA bomb somewhere on the M1 ,off the M1 wherever it was. John Major was pPM at the time and he immediately stepped in and voiced an intention to end terrorists right to silence, he picked the right moment and the country was behind him, he got that past and everybody thought yes why should terrorists be able to hide behind silence? That’s a different argument, however when we were not looking that changed from terrorist right to silence to criminals right to silence.\nIf I say the word criminal, perhaps you immediately think of a hoodlum with a knife, or whatever the case is, yes, often that is the case, but it could also be you in an unprovoked scuffle, in town, in a restaurant, or in a public place and you could suddenly be facing a criminal charge even though you are not and never have been a criminal.\nHow would you like it if you don’t know what to say and you don’t want some bent police officer putting words in your mouth to try and fit you up, is that right?\nLet’s go a bit further, not long after that the speed camera appeared all of the people who were safety conscious were in full agreement, because it will protect our children from speeding motorists, how many speeding cameras have you seen planted in front of schools? Zero, because drivers slow down near schools, that is not where they put them, they put them at the end of blind bends, so that they can catch you out because it’s about revenue, but there was a legal precedent with the speed camera that was and is significant and it has been missed and the media has made nothing of this.\nWith the introduction of the speed camera for the first time since the Magna Carta this country went from innocent till proven guilty to guilty till proven innocent\nSince then we have had incremental changes over the last two or three years we have had the public order Bill come in, because you are not allowed to protest, you have to get permission to protest, because the government don’t want you to be able to go out in force and express your disagreement with their corrupt and self-serving incremental legal changes. What have the public done to object to this? Even on something as simple as ULEZ, even though most of you are so angry, we still get people pop up with “why don’t you buy a new car” as I said incremental changes, what if you who made that comment have just bought a £30/40 000 car and in a few months time this crook who is implementing this, lowers emissions even more and you can’t drive your car, that you paid £30/40 000 for, at a time when there is a bubble in the price of cars, and in a year’s time you have to chop that in for t£20,000 to buy something newer so that you could drive around, unless of course you are in a financial position where you don’t mind, or you are happy to pay £12.50 a time to drive around on unclogged streets because the plebeians can’t afford to drive anymore?\nPerhaps that would be nearer the mark and perhaps you possibly need a new car? (that was a dig) anyway that’s my thoughts on the matter, this is serious, this is a major Leap forward in a direction towards a dystopian society and I’m not going down the conspiracy route, I am referring to fact ,what I’ve referred to in the past is fact, it is sinister and it should concern all of us and we need to do our level best to stop this now thank you very much see you next time.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_new-experiments-in-self-teaching/content_131.html": "New experiments in self-teaching – Sugata Mitra\nBackground\nAround 12 years ago, Sugata Mitra embarked on a journey to address a critical issue prevalent in developing countries – the lack of access to good teachers. He noticed that there were many remote places worldwide where qualified educators were reluctant to go, leaving children without the quality education they needed the most. However, through a series of groundbreaking experiments and a belief in the innate curiosity of children, Mitra discovered a revolutionary approach to learning that could transform education as we know it.\nI have always been an advocate of experiential learning, for me, the notion of sitting in a classroom being spoken at is anathema, especially for the active mind that invariably struggles to maintain attention.\nHowever, in the modern day, the active, creative or free thinking mind, mainstream education is a poison chalice, that can hinder their learning, instead of enhancing it. Any child who does not fit in to the ‘Robot behaviour’ that is the norm, is so easily diagnosed as ADHD and then pumped with Ritalin, which is criminal. Now, with the move to ‘Academies’ education is becoming the servant of the corporations, inhibiting free thinking and focusing on creating ‘worker Ants’ for the future.\nI came across this man a few years ago, and I was really impressed by his experiment, but not surprised by the results. On a personal level, I was one of the children who could not maintain attention at school, I could not focus, I lost interest and was easily distracted or bored. It was not until years later, when I went to University as a mature student that I realised it was not me, it was in fact the teaching methods in schools.\nAfter completing my business studies, I was privileged to have been offered a place on a pioneering ‘Action Learning Master’s Degree, this was based on discussion, experiential learning, and interaction. This was the most progressive education period I have ever experienced and it confirmed my thoughts on learning styles.\nBackground\nAround 12 years ago, Sugata Mitra embarked on a journey to address a critical issue prevalent in developing countries – the lack of access to good teachers. He noticed that there were many remote places worldwide where qualified educators were reluctant to go, leaving children without the quality education they needed the most. However, through a series of groundbreaking experiments and a belief in the innate curiosity of children, Mitra discovered a revolutionary approach to learning that could transform education as we know it.\nThe Hole in the Wall Experiment\nIn 1999, Mitra initiated his first experiment in a New Delhi slum. He embedded a computer with high-speed internet into a wall and left it there for the children to explore on their own. Despite having little exposure to formal education and technology, the children surprised everyone by quickly learning to use the computer and the internet independently. From browsing to recording music and even capturing pictures, they demonstrated an incredible ability to learn what they were interested in without any formal instruction.\nThe Power of Self-Organized Learning\nMitra’s experiments expanded across India and other parts of the world, revealing that groups of children could master computer and internet skills without explicit guidance. He observed children learning complex topics, such as biotechnology, on their own using online resources. Through group collaboration and collective curiosity, children were able to achieve educational objectives and develop a deep understanding of various subjects.\nBreaking Language Barriers\nIn a remarkable incident, Mitra discovered that children with strong regional accents taught themselves to speak English with a neutral British accent by using speech-to-text interfaces on computers. This finding showed the power of interest-driven learning and the potential for technology to transcend language barriers and bridge educational gaps.\nThe Role of the Granny Cloud\nTo further support self-organized learning, Mitra introduced the concept of the “granny cloud.” Grandmothers from various locations volunteered to provide an hour of broadband connection each week, acting as virtual mentors for the children through Skype. These enthusiastic mentors offered encouragement and admiration, creating a nurturing environment where the children thrived in their quest for knowledge.\nSelf-Organized Learning Environments (SOLEs)\nBuilding on his findings, Mitra developed Self-Organized Learning Environments (SOLEs). These environments consist of groups of children collaborating around computers and big screens, engaging in inquiry-based learning. Mediators, often remote educators from various locations, facilitate learning experiences when necessary, but the focus remains on self-directed learning.\nThe Future of Education: A Self-Organizing System\nMitra believes that education is a self-organizing system, where learning emerges naturally when children are allowed to explore topics that genuinely interest them. While more research is needed to prove this hypothesis, Mitra’s vision for the future of education is bold and inspiring.\nTransforming Education Globally\nMitra envisions a future where one billion children have access to 100 million mediators and 10 million SOLEs, with a budget of 180 billion dollars over ten years. This ambitious initiative has the potential to transform education globally and equip children with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in an ever-changing world.\nConclusion\nSugata Mitra’s groundbreaking experiments demonstrate the power of self-organized learning and the boundless potential of curious minds. By leveraging technology and fostering collaborative environments, we can unleash the true potential of education and empower children worldwide to become lifelong learners and critical thinkers. As we work towards building a self-organizing education system, we must embrace curiosity, encourage exploration, and harness the innate desire to learn that lies within every child. Together, we can shape a brighter future for generations to come.\nRead more about my thoughts on interactive/action learning HERE:",

This new system will give people a choice between the services of any physician or other healthcare professional in the private or public sector, regardless of their financial situation. The Health Insurance Organization will pay for all medical and pharmaceutical expenses.\nThe health system of Cyprus is changing in practice from 1 June 2019. Once it is in place, each personal physician will be entitled to enter up to 2500 patients in his or her list. A personal physician may be a general practitioner, a pediatrician for children under 15 years old, a geriatrician for the over 65s, a physician or other physician who, according to the relevant legislation, has special training in general medical practice By the Medical Council of Cyprus or has a certificate confirming the right to “practice general medical practitioner under the national social security system in Cyprus or other EU Member States”. The PI will have the responsibility to give the first diagnosis and to give the appropriate treatment. In cases where specialised services are needed, the PI will issue a referral for a specialist doctor.\nGESY – A Healthcare System for Cyprus\nPer the new Gesy laws, the first phase of introduction, which will come into force on March 1, 2019, will include out-of-hospital care, with wage-earners, pensioners, income-earners, and state officials contributing 1.7 per cent of their income, employers 1.85 per cent, the state 1.65 per cent, and the self-employed 2.55 per cent.\nThe second phase, which will come into force on March 1, 2020, will introduce hospital treatment, until full implementation of Gesy three months later, with wage-earners, pensioners, income-earners, and state officials contributing 2.65 per cent of their income, employers 2.9 per cent, the state 4.7 per cent, and the self-employed 4 per cent.\nCo-payments are capped at a maximum €300 per year for patients and €75 per year for low-pension earners and recipients of the government’s Guaranteed Minimum Income.\nComment\nThere are a few factors that I feel have not been addressed, for example, the H.I.O.(Healthcare Insurance Organisation) will be in charge of reimbursing healthcare expenses, however, once this system is in place, there is nothing to stop the ‘Healthcare Tourism’ that is bankrupting the NHS in the UK.\nWill the system be exposed to the obligation to care for anyone who arrivesand declares a need for healthcare, which will be difficult to refuse under EU legislation? It is unclear how soon repatriating Cypriots, or anyone else who chooses to make Cyprus their home will be covered by the system, (I’m not saying there are not measures in place, only that I have not found anything factual yet)\nOne more thing, there is an information PDF available for download from the GESY website, but it is only available in Greek.\nDownload PDF presentation HERE:\nFurther information available from the GESY website\nA hospital referral to see a specialist is made and an appointment given. It should be made clear at the time of making the appointment that the date they give you is within the date on the referral, otherwise you have to go back to your GP for another referral letter. What happened to me was the referral letter was out of date for the appointment given so was not allowed to see the specialist. After travelling for one hour to get to the hospital and waiting in a very long queue which takes 5 to ten minutes per patient just to register so was totally frustrated at the outcome. I feel this should be addressed when appointment date is given.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_muslim-students-legal-challenge-against-schools-prayer-ban-dismissed-by-high-court/content_558.html": "Muslim Student’s Legal Challenge Against School’s Prayer Ban Dismissed by High Court\nA Muslim student’s legal battle against a London secondary school’s ban on prayer rituals on campus has come to an unsuccessful conclusion at the High Court. The court ruled in favor of Michaela School, a non-faith state secondary institution located in Wembley, upholding the school’s policy that prohibits students from engaging in prayer rituals during school hours.\nThe student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, argued that the school’s ban on prayer rituals was discriminatory and infringed upon her right to freely practice her religion. However, in an 83-page written judgment, Mr. Justice Linden dismissed the student’s case, stating that “the claimant at the very least impliedly accepted, when she enrolled at the school, that she would be subject to restrictions on her ability to manifest her religion.”\nKatharine Birbalsingh, the founder and headteacher of Michaela School, celebrated the ruling as a “victory for all schools.” In a statement released on social media, Birbalsingh asserted that schools “should be free to do what is right for the pupils it serves” and should not be forced to change their approach simply because one student and their parent disapprove of a particular policy.\nThe case centered around an incident in March 2023 when up to 30 Muslim students at Michaela School began praying communally in the school yard, using their blazers as makeshift prayer mats. This prompted the school to introduce the contested ban on prayer rituals due to concerns about a “culture shift” towards “segregation between religious groups and intimidation within the group of Muslim pupils,” according to the court’s evidence.\nMichaela School, which boasts an “outstanding” rating from Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills, is known for its strict rules and expectations for students. These include remaining silent in corridors, focusing extensively on teachers during lessons, and adhering to uniform policies. The school’s rules also prohibit students from gathering in groups larger than four, including in the school yard.\nWhile there is no legal requirement for schools in England to provide designated spaces or times for students to pray, some schools do choose to make such accommodations for their Muslim students. However, the High Court’s ruling affirms the right of individual schools, headteachers, and governing bodies to make decisions about whether or not to allow prayer rituals on their premises, based on their assessment of what is best for their student body.\nDuring the legal proceedings, the student’s legal team argued that the ban on prayer rituals had a disproportionate impact on Muslim students due to the specific times and rituals required for Islamic prayers. They contended that the student was making a “modest” request to be allowed to pray for approximately five minutes during her lunchtime on dates when her faith required it, but not during lessons.\nHowever, Mr. Justice Linden rejected this argument, stating that Islam allows for “Qada prayers” or “make-up” prayers for those that have been missed, and that the student herself acknowledged that she and her friends believed prayer was not permitted at school even before the policy was introduced, and therefore made up for missed prayers when they returned home.\nWhile the student expressed disappointment with the ruling, she affirmed her belief that she “did the right thing in seeking to challenge the ban” and that she was “true to myself and my religion.” She plans to remain at Michaela School and focus on her upcoming GCSE exams, expressing gratitude for the understanding shown by her non-Muslim friends at the school.\nThe student’s mother also voiced her support for her daughter’s “impassioned stance,” stating that while she was “dismayed” by the High Court’s ruling, she stood firm in her decision to back her daughter’s legal challenge, and believed that her daughter had gained “invaluable lessons from the experience.”\nThe case has reignited broader discussions about the role of faith in England’s education system, with secular organizations such as the National Secular Society and Humanists UK renewing calls for reforms to separate religion from schools entirely. On the other hand, the ruling has been welcomed by those who argue that schools should have the autonomy to set their own policies and create an environment that fosters inclusion and prevents potential divisions along religious lines.\nAs the debate continues, the High Court’s judgment serves as a reminder of the complex balancing act required when navigating issues of religious freedom, educational autonomy, and the rights and well-being of all students within the diverse landscape of England’s school system.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_recognising-the-symptoms-of-bipolar-disorder/content_44.html": "Bipolar disorder is a treatable brain disorder marked by extreme shifts in a person’s mood and disposition. Periods of intense mania are followed by bouts of severe depression, often with periods of normalcy in between.\nWhile on either end of the spectrum, sufferers of bipolar disorder often find it difficult to concentrate and maintain functionality sufficient for leading a productive life. Those who experience severe episodes of depression and hypo-mania are classified as suffering from bipolar II disorder, which women are diagnosed with more often than men.\nIt is estimated that over two million Americans have a form of bipolar disorder, although many may be unaware of it. Bipolar disorder can develop at any time, however, most will experience the onset of symptoms in the post adolescence/early adulthood phase of their life.\nFortunately, bipolar disorder can be treated but must be managed for long term success. Recognising the symptoms of bipolar disorder is often the first step toward proper diagnosis and treatment.\nThe manic phases of bipolar disorder can be marked by an increase in energy, restlessness, irritability, the inability to concentrate, aggressiveness, euphoria, irrational thought and limited sleep, among other symptoms.\nThe depression phase of bipolar disorder can be marked by feelings of sadness, guilt, helplessness, pessimism and agitation, as well as weight fluctuation, disturbed sleep patterns and a loss of interest in life. Suicidal thoughts may be present during prolonged periods of depression as well.\nThe importance of recognising the symptoms of bipolar disorder cannot be overstated as many who suffer from it are improperly diagnosed because of the nature of their condition. Sufferers may feel that the extreme shifts in mood they are experiencing are simply the ebb and flow of life. They may seek help during periods of depression and not disclose their manic behaviour because they associate it with happiness or normalcy.\nRecent attention paid to bipolar disorder and bipolar II disorder in the media, however, has helped to educate the population. Just as both forms of bipolar disorder have become more widely recognised by the medical community, the general public is also more aware than ever of their existence.\nGuidance is available for those who exhibit some of the symptoms of bipolar disorder as there are now many excellent resources for detailed information, both in print and on the web. Anyone who feels they may be suffering from bipolar disorder should always consult their physician. With proper treatment, those who have experienced the debilitating nature of this affliction can go on to lead healthy, productive lives.",

Despite polls suggesting the Labour Party would secure well into the 40% range, they only managed 35% of the overall vote – a 1% decrease from their performance last year. The Conservative Party, on the other hand, saw their share collapse to just 26%.\nThe Rise of Reform UK\nWhile the two major parties struggled, Reform UK – led by George Galloway – achieved their best result yet, securing an average of 15% of the vote. In the Blackpool by-election, their share reached an impressive 16.9%. Although they only fielded a handful of candidates for council seats this time around, Galloway has threatened to contest every parliamentary seat in the upcoming general election.\nSummary:\nIf we begin by analysing the results of the recent local elections across the UK. Despite polls suggesting Labour would receive over 40% of the vote, they only secured 35%, which was actually a 1% decrease from the previous year. The Conservatives saw their vote share collapse to just 26%.\nMeanwhile, the Reform UK party led by George Galloway achieved their best result yet, averaging 15% of the vote. In the Blackpool by-election, they received 16.9%. Reform UK only fielded a handful of candidates in the local elections as they are focusing on the upcoming general election, where Galloway has threatened to stand candidates in every constituency.\nInterestingly, while the Conservatives lost 474 council seats, Labour only picked up 186 of those losses. The Liberal Democrats gained 104 seats, allowing them to leapfrog the Conservatives as the second largest party in terms of council seats held.\nThe speaker characterises this outcome not as a Labour victory, but more as a collapse of the Conservative vote. Many voters seemed to reject the Tories but did not want to back Labour either. This raises the prospect of a hung parliament after the general election if neither main party secures a majority.\nA hung parliament could force Labour and the Conservatives to reform the current electoral system that has allowed them to cyclically alternate in power while excluding smaller parties. However, proportional representation also risks giving extremist voices a platform in Parliament by making it easier for fringe parties to gain seats.\nThe speaker expresses concern about the state of British democracy, arguing that the government rarely has a true mandate from over 50% of the population. Policies like mass immigration and closer EU ties were never explicitly endorsed by voters.\nThere are also worries about restrictions on free speech, with people facing consequences like losing their jobs for expressing unpopular views on topics like gender ideology. The example of J.K. Rowling being praised for “standing up to the misogynist nutter” in Scotland is given.\nMany remain silent on such issues out of fear, which the speaker laments as unthinkable for a supposed “bastion of decency and democracy” like the UK.\nRegarding Labour’s poor performance, the speaker expects George Galloway’s Reform UK to siphon votes from disillusioned traditional Labour supporters who feel the party has betrayed its core values and lacks firm policies under Keir Starmer’s leadership.\nShifting to local issues, the speaker discusses attempts to reduce crime in Northampton by creating community WhatsApp groups to report incidents and put pressure on police to increase their presence. Addressing root causes like illegal tobacco/alcohol sales and instilling discipline in schools from a young age are also proposed as solutions.\nThe speaker closes by reiterating the need to “re-calibrate the compass of discipline and respect”, which some may perceive as a “far-right” view despite the speaker firmly standing by this stance. An open invitation is extended to engage in debate, either in agreement or disagreement.",

Our air has never been cleaner. We want to use technology to do our bit. But Net Zero is the wrong bit, at the wrong price, in the wrong timeframe. Westminster’s obsession with Net Zero is damaging our livelihoods and the economy. It has sent energy bills soaring. Made it harder for businesses to compete. It is costing tens of thousands of jobs and increasing inflation.\nNet zero means reducing man made CO2 emissions to stop climate change. It can’t. Climate change has happened for millions of years, before man made CO2 emissions, and will always change. We are better to adapt to warming, rather than pretend we can stop it. Up to 10 times more people die of cold than warmth. In Roman Britain some 2,000 years ago, it was 2 degrees warmer than now. Grapes for wine were grown in Yorkshire.\nCO2 is essential for photosynthesis to enable plant growth. CO2 only represents 0.04% of the atmosphere; the average garden greenhouse has 3 times more! The UK produces only 1% of global CO2 emissions, yet China produces 27%. China & India are building hundreds of coal fired power stations.\nEven the IPCC admits Net Zero would make no difference to sea level rise for 200-1,000 years; in other words they do not have a clue.\nInstead, Net Zero sends our money abroad and damages critical industries like steel production. The government has turned Britain from being an exporter of oil and gas into a net importer. They have bet our future on unreliable wind and solar power and destroyed our energy security. It’s time for a common sense energy strategy.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nScrap Net Zero and Related Subsidies.\nThe UK cost of Net Zero has been estimated by the National Grid and others at some £2 trillion or more. It is so big that no one really knows. The public sector is spending billions each year with no accountability or transparency. Ditching Net Zero would save the public sector some £20 billion per year for the next 25 years, possibly more.\nScrap Annual £10 Billion of Renewable Energy Subsidies.\nAchieve this through equivalent taxes on them. Renewables are not cheaper. Our bills have increased dramatically in line with the huge increase in renewables capacity over the last 15 years.\nCheap, Secure Energy.\nWe must use the energy treasure under our feet. Start fast-track licences of North Sea gas and oil. Grant shale gas licences on test sites for 2 years. Then enable major production when safety is proven, with local compensation schemes. The value of shale gas is potentially hundreds of billions over 30 years to the taxpayer. This could transform our nations fortunes and ensure prosperity for generations to come.\nThereafter:\nCleaner Energy from New Technology.\nFast-track clean nuclear energy with new small modular reactors, built in Britain. Increase and incentivise UK lithium mining for electric batteries, Combined Cycle gas turbines, clean synthetic fuel and clean coal mining.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_millionaires-leaving-the-uk-in-huge-numbers/content_1142.html": "Millionaires leaving the UK in huge numbers\nOne Millionaire Departs Britain Every 45 Minutes Under Labour Government\nDramatic 157% Surge in Wealth Exodus During Sir Keir Starmer’s First Year in Power\nFresh data suggests that Britain witnessed the departure of one millionaire every 45 minutes during Labour’s inaugural year in power, marking an unprecedented exodus of wealthy individuals from the United Kingdom.\nAccording to newly released figures, a staggering 10,800 millionaires relocated from British shores to overseas destinations last year, representing more than twice the number recorded in 2023. This translates to approximately 30 high-net-worth individuals departing daily, or roughly one every three-quarters of an hour.\nThis significant wealth migration coincides with Labour’s proposals to dismantle centuries-old tax legislation that has historically permitted foreign investors to maintain residence in Britain whilst protecting their offshore wealth from domestic taxation.\nJason Hollands, managing director at the prestigious financial advisory firm Evelyn Partners, expressed serious concerns about the crackdown, suggesting it portrays Britain as “hostile to wealthy people”. He elaborated, “The signal it sends to people is that the country has a hostile attitude to wealthy people who will bring money into the UK. These individuals are highly mobile, and with the proliferation of digital enterprises, one can now operate from numerous locations without necessarily requiring a physical presence in this jurisdiction.”\nAnalytics firm New World Wealth, in collaboration with advisory specialists Henley & Partners, revealed that the number of high-net-worth individuals—defined as those possessing liquid assets exceeding £821,153 ($1 million)—departing the country witnessed a dramatic 157% increase in 2024. Their comprehensive analysis showed that upwards of 10,000 millionaires relocated abroad last year, a marked increase from the previous year’s figure of 4,300.\nThis mass departure coincided with Rishi Sunak’s calling of a snap election, which culminated in Labour securing a decisive victory. The data indicates that, throughout 2024, only China experienced a greater degree of capital flight than the United Kingdom.\nSeveral nations have emerged as preferred destinations for these departing wealthy individuals. Italy, which introduced an attractive flat-tax scheme for non-domiciled residents in 2017, has become particularly popular. Other favoured destinations include Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Singapore.\nThe exodus has not been limited to millionaires alone. New World Wealth’s detailed analysis revealed that 78 centi-millionaires—individuals possessing assets worth £100 million—and 12 billionaires chose to leave the country during this period.\nNotable departures include prominent business figures such as Charlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, and Christian Angermayer, the German technology entrepreneur, who opted to relocate to Switzerland last year.\nLabour’s proposed reforms target the scaling back of tax regulations that currently allow wealthy individuals to reside in the UK without incurring tax liability on overseas income and gains. According to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) statistics from 2023, approximately 74,000 non-domiciled individuals were resident in Britain, with 37,800 having maintained UK residence for at least seven years, each paying an annual fee of £30,000 to protect their offshore wealth from domestic taxation.\nA new taxation regime, initially conceived by former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and subsequently maintained by the Labour government, will take effect this April. Under these revised regulations, new non-domiciled residents arriving in Britain will be granted a four-year period during which their foreign wealth remains exempt from domestic taxation. Following this period, they will be required to contribute at the same rate as ordinary British taxpayers.\nFor existing non-domiciled residents, a two-year transition period to the new scheme has been established. Additionally, foreign earnings will become subject to inheritance tax considerations.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility projects that this tax reform will generate approximately £2.5 billion annually over the next five years. However, research conducted by the Adam Smith Institute in October suggested more sobering implications. Their analysis indicated that the abolition of non-domiciled tax status could result in the elimination of 23,000 jobs over the next six years through reduced investment and consumption.\nThe Institute’s projections suggest this could cost the British economy £600 million annually in lost GDP by 2030, escalating to £1.3 billion per year by 2035—representing a cumulative loss of £6.52 billion over the coming decade.\nDavid Hawkins, representing Foreign Investors for Britain, a coalition of non-domiciled individuals, described the Government’s policy to The Times as “a monumental act of national self-harm”. He further elaborated, “It appears that decisions have been made not based on the evidence but based on ideology. It’s a genuine concern as increasing numbers of people choose to leave. This exodus impacts businesses, employment opportunities, investment, economic spending, tax revenue, and philanthropic contributions.”\nThe implications of this wealth migration extend beyond mere financial considerations, potentially affecting various sectors of the British economy, from luxury real estate to high-end services, and could influence future foreign investment decisions regarding the United Kingdom.\nSummary\n* The UK experienced an unprecedented exodus of wealthy individuals in 2024, with one millionaire leaving every 45 minutes (approximately 30 per day), totaling 10,800 millionaires for the year.\n* The departure rate increased dramatically by 157% compared to 2023, when only 4,300 millionaires left the country. This coincided with Labour coming to power following a snap election.\n* Among those departing were 78 centi-millionaires (individuals with assets over £100 million) and 12 billionaires. Notable departures included Pimlico Plumbers founder Charlie Mullins and German tech entrepreneur Christian Angermayer.\n* The exodus appears linked to Labour’s plans to reform non-dom tax laws, which currently allow wealthy foreign residents to shelter offshore wealth from UK taxes. There are approximately 74,000 non-doms in the UK, with 37,800 having lived there for at least seven years.\n* Under the new tax regime starting in April, new non-doms will only have four years of tax shelter on foreign wealth, after which they must pay standard UK taxes. Existing non-doms will have a two-year transition period.\n* Popular destinations for these wealthy emigrants include Italy (which offers an attractive flat tax rate), Switzerland, UAE, USA, and Singapore. The UK’s capital flight was second only to China during this period.\n* The Adam Smith Institute projects significant economic impact from these changes, including:\n– Loss of 23,000 jobs over six years\n– £600 million annual GDP loss by 2030\n– £1.3 billion annual GDP loss by 2035\n– Cumulative loss of £6.52 billion over the next decade\n* While the tax reforms are expected to generate £2.5 billion annually for the next five years, critics argue this may be offset by the broader economic impact of wealthy individuals leaving the country.",

As Rishi Sunak’s tenure in office draws to a close, the prospect of a trade deal with India stands as a pivotal opportunity that could reshape Britain’s economic and geopolitical future. While Sunak’s accomplishments may not be overwhelmingly tangible, the potential of a comprehensive trade agreement with India is a legacy in the making, holding the power to solidify Britain’s pivot toward the East and decisively alter its stance on rejoining the European Union.\nEmbracing the East: A Trade Deal that Matters\nAmid discussions of Sunak’s initiatives to promote mathematics in schools and elevate the popularity of chess, a trade deal with India emerges as the defining feat of his tenure. Such a trade agreement could pave the way for Britain’s closer alignment with the dynamic economies of Asia and the Pacific, presenting a viable alternative to the EU Single Market that the nation once clung to. With the European Union’s share of the global economy steadily shrinking and its regulatory complexities impeding growth, it’s clear that Britain must explore new avenues for trade.\nThe India Opportunity: Unlocking Prosperity and Influence\nAs the UK contemplates trade beyond Europe, India emerges as a natural ally. This South Asian powerhouse has already surpassed the UK in GDP and is projected to surpass the economies of Germany and Japan, becoming the world’s third-largest economy by 2030. A trade deal with India promises unparalleled economic opportunities for British industries, particularly in sectors where the nation has excelled, such as legal, financial, and consulting services. By establishing deeper economic ties with India, Britain can ingrain itself into Asia’s commercial fabric and propel its economic growth in an exciting direction.\nHistory, Culture, and Commerce: Strong Foundations for Collaboration\nBeyond the economic metrics, a UK-India trade deal builds upon the deep-rooted historical and familial connections between the two nations. Examples like Tata’s investment in an electric vehicle battery factory showcase the thriving flow of capital between the UK and India. The potential for lowered tariffs, simplified executive mobility, and unified trade standards can foster a flourishing ecosystem of business collaborations. This trade deal doesn’t just facilitate economic growth; it cements the strong interpersonal relationships that have flourished over centuries.\nGeopolitical Implications: Charting a New Course\nIn a world marked by geopolitical complexities, a trade pact with India can exert far-reaching influence. By steering India toward Western trading systems, the UK can play a pivotal role in countering China’s ambitions to establish a dominant economic bloc. This partnership could safeguard India from being locked into China’s orbit and grant the UK greater influence on the global stage. Furthermore, such a move could forever alter Britain’s trajectory with regards to the European Union.\nThe Inevitable Shift: A Reimagined Future\nWith a trade deal in place, the UK would be firmly anchored in an Atlantic-Pacific trading framework. The combination of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade agreement with India, and robust trade ties with North America would firmly establish the nation’s new trade narrative. This formidable alliance would fundamentally differentiate the UK from the EU’s Brussels-centric approach. As the paths of Britain and the EU diverge further, rejoining the European Union would become a distant and unrealistic prospect.\nA Legacy in the Making: Sunak’s Opportunity\nFor Rishi Sunak, the journey to secure a trade deal with India represents more than a policy objective; it’s an enduring legacy. His familial connections and deep understanding of both countries could prove instrumental in driving this monumental agreement forward. Yet, challenges loom. The negotiation process could bog down in intricate details, and vested interests might hinder progress. With the clock ticking, the pressure is on to wrap up the deal before Sunak’s anticipated visit to India in September, and ideally, before the year’s end.\nIn the grand scheme of Britain’s history, this potential trade deal with India is a turning point. It’s a chance to forge new economic partnerships, harness global influence, and redefine the nation’s role on the world stage. As the timeline narrows and negotiations intensify, the significance of this trade deal cannot be overstated. It’s more than trade; it’s a vision for a reimagined future – one where Britain’s destiny is firmly shaped by the East.",

I’d like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for your wide-ranging and honest input in the comments section. Whether it’s good, bad, or somewhere in between, I welcome all your comments.\nSpelling Matters: Automatic Captions and Linguistic Quirks\nFirst and foremost, I’d like to address a common point of contention – the spelling errors in my captions. In my defense, I must admit that time constraints often get the better of me. These captions are automatically generated, and although I make an effort to review them and correct glaring mistakes, it’s not always feasible. One curiosity I’ve noticed is that, quite often, these auto-generated captions are in US English, which can lead to some head-scratching moments for us Brits. They seem to have a penchant for “Zs,” and let’s not forget, it’s “aluminium,” not “aluminum.” Is it too much to ask for everything to be in the Queen’s English? They could keep their intriguing but incorrect spelling.\nFacing the ‘Woke Brigade’: Embracing Insults and Provocation\nNow, let’s talk about the elephant in the room – the woke brigade. They consistently grace us with their presence, armed with a stream of insults. It seems they have little more to contribute. Some of their favourites include labels like “racist,” “fascist,” and “xenophobic.” A recent gem was being dubbed a “mouthpiece for the Daily Telegraph.” I must confess, I find these derogatory comments rather endearing. Why, you might ask? Because it’s reassuring to know that not only are they listening, but I’m also succeeding in getting under their skin. That, my friends, is precisely my intention in this space.\nChallenging Allegations: Addressing Immigrant Background and Immigration Policies\nMoving on, there have been references to my immigrant background and the implication that somehow I advocate for open immigration policies. Allow me to set the record straight – my parents were immigrants, but that doesn’t mean I’m in favour of throwing open our doors to all and sundry, criminals or otherwise, who wish to elbow their way into our country with a sense of entitlement. Such insinuations of racism are, in my view, unfounded. It’s essential to recognise that labelling someone as racist is not an opinion; it’s an allegation.\nPositive Discrimination and the Quest for a Fair Playing Field\nLet’s delve into another hot-button issue – positive discrimination. There was a time when some degree of positive discrimination was warranted to promote a fairer society. However, I’d like to argue that we’ve reached a juncture where it has the opposite effect. It fosters resentment and, more importantly, undermines the hard work, dedication, and sacrifices made by individuals from minority backgrounds to achieve their positions. People around them might question whether they earned their roles based on merit or due to other factors. The fairest way to structure society, in my opinion, is to award jobs based on merit, regardless of an individual’s background. We’re living in an era where everyone, regardless of race, creed, colour, or faith, has equal access to education and opportunities. It’s high time we levelled the playing field, ensuring that no one can leapfrog others simply because they fear being labelled as racist.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I’d like to wrap up this topic for now. Of course, I could go on endlessly, but I’m keen to hear your thoughts. To all the haters out there, please do your best – you’re welcome to reveal your identities, join me in a video discussion, or even share links to your own channels. I genuinely look forward to hearing your perspectives. Thank you very much for tuning in, and I wish you all a wonderful evening. Until the next video – bye-bye for now.",

The financial times have reported that Germany’s economy remained stagnant in the last quarter, neither growing nor contracting. However, the true story behind these figures reveals an increasingly rapid decline in industrial production. As pessimism grows among German industrialists, the outlook for the country’s industry appears bleak, drawing comparisons with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. This blog post delves into the implications of Germany’s deindustrialization and its potential impact on the European Union.\nDeindustrialisation in Germany\nThe ominous signs of deindustrialization in Germany are hard to ignore. Rapid declines in industrial production, coupled with gloomy PMI surveys, paint a worrying picture for the German economy. The issue has escalated to the point where even the mainstream media and German business leaders have started discussing it. The business community has raised concerns over energy policies and the green transition, which they believe are being enforced too hastily.\nThe Role of Sanctions and Energy Policy\nThe suspension of Nord Stream 2 and the implementation of sanctions have been significant contributors to Germany’s deindustrialization. While some are reluctant to admit that the sanctions are a mistake, it is evident that they have had a substantial impact on the country’s industrial decline. Reversing these decisions now would be a complex and time-consuming process, given the preparation required for Nord Stream 2 and the geopolitical obstacles in the way.\nThe Political Backlash and Rising Unhappiness\nThe political repercussions of Germany’s deindustrialization are becoming apparent. Recent polls indicate a growing shift in public sentiment. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, known for its opposition to current policies, is gaining support, particularly in the former East Germany. Chancellor Schultz’s SPD has seen a decline in support, reflecting the rising dissatisfaction with the current political landscape.\nThe European Union’s Challenges\nThe deindustrialization in Germany has wider implications for the entire European Union. As Germany serves as the EU’s export machine, the weakening of its industrial sector has led to a loss of competitiveness in global markets. While the United States has experienced economic growth, the EU has remained stagnant, with its economy growing only six percent over 15 years. The EU’s dependence on exports means that the decline of German goods further erodes its export position.\nThe Future of the European Union\nGiven the precarious situation, the European Union faces a significant challenge in sustaining its financial stability. The EU’s primary cash provider, Germany, is grappling with deindustrialization, putting immense strain on the economic structure of the entire union. The situation has raised concerns about the EU’s long-term energy security, prompting calls for support to Ukraine and increased pressure on Russia, as part of a neocon plan to gain control over Russian resources.\nConclusion\n– The economic situation in Germany raises concerns due to ongoing deindustrialization.\n– In the last quarter, Germany’s economy remained stagnant according to the financial times.\n– Rapid decline in industrial production and pessimism among German industrialists are alarming indicators.\n– Mainstream media and German business leaders are discussing the deindustrialization issue.\n– Sanctions and energy policies have played a significant role in Germany’s industrial decline.\n– Germany’s political landscape faces a backlash, with growing support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n– The European Union’s economy has grown only 6% over 15 years, compared to 82% growth in the United States.\n– Germany’s deindustrialization has affected the EU’s export competitiveness.\n– The EU’s long-term energy security is a concern, leading to calls for support to Ukraine and pressure on Russia.\n– The EU’s financial stability faces challenges due to Germany’s deindustrialization and its impact on the entire union.\nGermany’s ongoing deindustrialization poses a serious threat to its economy and has far-reaching implications for the European Union. The decline in industrial production, coupled with political unrest, indicates a potential industrial recession in Germany. The EU’s export-driven economy is losing competitiveness, and its financial growth remains stagnant. Amid these challenges, the EU is faced with the need to reconsider its policies and find sustainable solutions to support its member states. The future remains uncertain, but addressing the issue of deindustrialization and fostering a cohesive approach will be crucial for the EU’s long-term stability and success.\nThis makes perfect sense, the treacherous EU actually provoked this war, with the aim of gaining control over Russian minerals, but it has backfired badly and now it is the EU which is suffering the consequences and quite rightly so.\nThis makes perfect sense, the treacherous EU actually provoked this war, with the aim of gaining control over Russian minerals, but it has backfired badly and now it is the EU which is suffering the consequences and quite rightly so.",

(the names of the beneficiaries are somewhat different, but I will leave it to you to work that one out, as we no longer have free speech!)\nHere are some of the reckless routes to rob the British public, that are under consideration:\n- Proposed changes to inheritance tax:\n– Reducing the nil rate band from £325,000 to £125,000\n– Imposing tax on lifetime gifts above £3,000 per year\n– Taxing unused pension savings upon death\n– Potential double taxation with inheritance and capital gains tax on estates\n- Capital gains tax proposals:\n– Increase to 53% on buy-to-let property or second home sales\n– Increase to 37% on share sales\n- Other potential tax changes:\n– Increase basic rate of dividend tax from 8.75% to 20%\n– Cut business and agricultural property reliefs\n– Impose national insurance on rental income for buy-to-let landlords\n– Increase national insurance for the self-employed\n- Pension changes:\n– Potential reduction of the 25% tax-free lump sum cap from £270,000 to £100,000 or lower\n- Vehicle-related changes coming soon:\n– Removal of 5% discount on fuel for petrol/diesel cars\n– Introduction of pay-per-mile road tax for electric vehicles\n- Other considerations:\n– Potential capital gains tax on assets for those leaving the country (Canada has been doing this for a while now and two-tier Keir is rumoured to have been picking Justin Trudeau’s brains about this.\n– Under this plan, those wishing to close their HMRC account and leave the country will any assets that are liable for CGT taxed at the current rate, as though they had been sold and this would need to be paid before leaving. Professional advice and planning is highly recommended here.\n– Cuts to pensioners’ winter fuel allowance which has already happened.\n– Proposal to axe free bus passes for the elderly\n– Likely removal of single person’s council tax discount\n– VAT on independent schools, which will clearly result in a net-loss in total revenue, but this will have a devastating effect on the industry, as tens or even hundreds of thousands of extra pupils will need to be educated in state schools.\nFor every child who leaves an independent schools, the loss in VAT added to the additional cost for them to enter a state school will result in the government collecting over £10,000 per year, per child, than they have budgeted for, this is not economics, this is deranged Keirenomics.\n- Other Concerns raised:\n– Described as a “nationalization of wealth”\n– Potential negative impact on savings, investments, and business startups\n– Reports of 1,900,000 heirs leaving the country (unverified)\n- Implementation timeline:\n– This won’t all happen in one go, but most of these hair-brained proposals are expected to be implemented during the course of this parliament, if they last that long.",

This latest incident suggests a deeply ingrained pattern that raises serious questions about law enforcement priorities and the state of free expression in modern Britain.\nThe Contemporary Context\nThe fresh controversy centres on South Wales Police’s response to social media commentary regarding a promotional video about asylum seekers in Wales. This development emerges against the backdrop of the recently concluded Pearson affair, where Essex Police’s handling of a year-old tweet drew widespread criticism and eventual public censure.\nThe Latest Incident: A Detailed Examination\nThe current situation involves an anonymous social media commentator known as “Cillian”, whose critical response to a Welsh Refugee Council video has attracted police attention. The video in question, produced in 2023, featured young schoolgirls in what was originally intended as a welcome message for Ukrainian refugees, though this specific context was notably absent from the final production.\nThe Timing and Resource Allocation Question\nPerhaps most telling about this case is the timing of the initial complaint – 11:30 PM on a Saturday evening. This timing merits particular scrutiny when considered against the backdrop of pressing criminal matters typically demanding police attention during weekend evenings, including:\n– Violent confrontations in town centres\n– Domestic violence incidents\n– Serious property crimes\n– Public order offences\n– Emergency response requirements\nStatistical Context and Police Priorities\nThe investigation’s launch becomes even more questionable when examining current crime statistics in south-west Wales:\n– A nearly 40% increase in shoplifting incidents\n– An 11% rise in weapon possession cases\n– Escalating knife-related offences\n– Stretched emergency response resources\n– Limited investigative capacity for serious crimes\nThe Original Content in Context\nThe video at the centre of this controversy warrants careful examination. Created as a school project, it featured young pupils listing various benefits available to refugees, including:\n– Child benefit provisions\n– Housing assistance\n– Educational access\n– Healthcare services\n– Additional support mechanisms\nEducational and Societal Implications\nThis incident raises significant questions about the approach to discussing complex social issues in educational settings:\n– The presentation of immigration policy to young students\n– The balance between compassion and practical considerations\n– The role of critical thinking in addressing complex social issues\n– The appropriateness of involving children in politically charged messaging\n– The broader implications for public discourse on sensitive topics\nInstitutional Responses and Aftermath\nThe fallout from this incident has prompted various institutional reactions:\n– The Welsh Refugee Council’s efforts to distance itself from the content\n– The school’s apparent regret over the project\n– The removal of related materials from official platforms\n– Ongoing public debate about appropriate boundaries\n– Questions about institutional judgment and responsibility\nThe Broader Context of Police Intervention\nThis case exemplifies a concerning trend in British policing:\n– The allocation of resources to social media monitoring\n– The response to politically charged complaints\n– The balance between public safety and free expression\n– The role of police in mediating public discourse\n– The influence of social pressure on policing priorities\nSocial Media and Public Discourse\nThe incident highlights several key aspects of contemporary social media interaction:\n– The rapid spread of controversial content\n– The role of community fact-checking and context provision\n– The impact of anonymous commentary on public debate\n– The intersection of free speech and responsible discourse\n– The challenges of moderating online conversations\nFuture Implications and Considerations\nThis situation presents British police forces with a crucial decision point regarding their approach to social media commentary. The options before them include:\n– Dismissing complaints that don’t meet criminal thresholds\n– Establishing clear guidelines for social media-related investigations\n– Prioritising resources toward serious criminal activities\n– Developing more nuanced approaches to online discourse\n– Maintaining public confidence while upholding free expression\nThe Way Forward\nThe resolution of this case will likely set important precedents for how similar situations are handled in future. Key considerations should include:\n– The appropriate threshold for police intervention\n– The balance between public interest and resource allocation\n– The protection of free expression in digital spaces\n– The role of law enforcement in online discourse\n– The maintenance of public order without overreach\nThis ongoing situation serves as a crucial test case for British policing in the digital age, highlighting the delicate balance between maintaining public order and protecting fundamental freedoms. The response to this incident will likely influence future approaches to similar situations, making it essential for all stakeholders to carefully consider the broader implications of their actions.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_immigration-threatens-the-very-future-of-the-eu/content_679.html": "Immigration threatens the very future of the EU\nLampedusa: The Mediterranean Island Caught in a Migration Crisis\nIntroduction: Lampedusa’s Unprecedented Migration Challenge\nNestled in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, the idyllic island of Lampedusa has unwittingly become the focal point of a migration crisis that has sent shockwaves through the European Union (EU). This tiny Italian island, situated closer to North Africa than the Italian mainland, has found itself at the epicenter of a migration surge that is testing the EU’s cohesion and response mechanisms. In this blog post, we delve into the turmoil and complexities that have engulfed Lampedusa.\nLampedusa: Gateway to Europe\nLampedusa, a mere seven miles in length, boasts a tranquil facade that belies the challenges it faces. It serves as a key gateway for migrants seeking entry into Europe, with nearly 130,000 arrivals recorded this year alone, a staggering doubling of last year’s figures. The island’s serene shores have borne witness to a relentless flow of migrants, and the situation is becoming increasingly untenable.\nOverwhelmed and Under Pressure: Lampedusa’s Recent Crisis\nLast week, Lampedusa was pushed to the brink as a surge of arrivals left its residents grappling with a daunting task. In just three days, over 8,000 people arrived on the island, surpassing its capacity by twentyfold and outnumbering its population. Desperate residents distributed food and water, while others took to the streets in protest.\nInside Lampedusa’s Migrant Centre: A Glimpse Behind Closed Doors\nAmid this turmoil, we were granted a rare opportunity to step inside Lampedusa’s migrant centre, managed by the Red Cross and reinforced by police personnel drafted from across Italy. While officials assert that individuals are free to leave, the reality appears quite different. The centre seemed meticulously prepared for our visit, giving the impression of a well-orchestrated event rather than a humanitarian crisis.\nThe Voices of the Migrants: A Tale of Silence and Fear\nEfforts to engage with migrants were met with obstacles, as we encountered repeated interruptions when attempting to speak with them. The reasons for these interruptions remain unclear. Despite our persistence, the migrants’ voices remained largely unheard, illustrating the complexities and challenges faced by those seeking refuge on Lampedusa.\nInternational Attention and Political Responses\nLampedusa’s dire situation has not gone unnoticed on the international stage. Italy’s government has employed fiery rhetoric, labeling the arrivals as an “invasion” and an “act of war.” This stark language has drawn attention and resources to the island. Meanwhile, the EU has proposed a billion-euro investment in Tunisia to bolster its economy and deter migrants from leaving. However, these efforts have exposed rifts in European cooperation, with France adamantly refusing to accept migrants from Lampedusa.\nThe Resilience of Lampedusa’s People\nAmid the chaos and uncertainty, Lampedusa’s residents continue to display remarkable resilience and compassion. The island’s annual festival, dedicated to the patron saint Madona de Porto Salvo, continues as a testament to the enduring spirit of its people. The mayor, freshly returned from the United Nations in New York, emphasises the need to treat all migrants, regardless of their origin, with humanity and fairness. Lampedusa finds itself at the mercy of powerful international forces, but its residents remain committed to finding humane solutions.\nConclusion: Lampedusa’s Uncertain Future\nLampedusa, once an obscure Mediterranean haven, now stands as a symbol of the profound migration challenges facing the EU. While the island’s fate hangs in the balance, its people eschew violent rhetoric and instead advocate for humane solutions. As Lampedusa navigates this tumultuous chapter in its history, the world watches with bated breath, hoping for a resolution that upholds the principles of compassion and solidarity.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_labour-can-be-stopped-by-just-100000-voters/content_1269.html": "Labour can be stopped by just 100,000 voters\nIn the lead-up to the upcoming general election in the United Kingdom, what initially appeared to be a predictable affair has transformed into a more intriguing contest. The political landscape has been enlivened by the ascendancy of Reform UK and the potential return of Nigel Farage to the forefront of British politics. However, the complexity of the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system adds another layer of uncertainty to the proceedings.\nRecent research and reports have shed light on the precarious position of the Labour Party, despite their apparent lead in the polls. While the popular vote is certainly significant, the true battleground lies in the marginal seats scattered across the country. These constituencies, where the outcome is far from certain, could prove pivotal in determining the final composition of Parliament.\nAccording to the latest analysis, a mere 34,000 swing voters in key marginal seats have the potential to halve Labour’s projected super majority. This figure becomes even more striking when considering the national picture: a shift of just 132,000 voters away from Labour could potentially deny the party an outright majority. In the context of a general election, this is a remarkably small number of individuals capable of dramatically altering the political landscape.\nThe implications of such a scenario are far-reaching. A hung Parliament, where no single party commands an overall majority, could necessitate a partnership or coalition between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Alternatively, Labour might find itself governing as a minority, requiring support from other parties on a case-by-case basis to pass legislation.\nThe fluidity of the situation is further emphasised by the theoretical possibility that, should these 132,000 voters switch their allegiance to Reform UK, the political calculus could shift even more dramatically. While it remains unlikely that Reform UK would secure a significant number of seats due to the nature of the electoral system, their increased vote share could potentially position them as a more influential opposition force.\nHistorical precedents underscore the importance of marginal seats and the impact of relatively small numbers of voters. The 2015 general election serves as a prime example. The Conservative Party secured a majority of 12 seats, a victory that appeared comfortable on the surface. However, post-election analysis revealed that this majority hinged on the votes of approximately 900 people across the country. Had these individuals cast their ballots differently, the outcome of the election – and the subsequent direction of the country – could have been markedly different.\nA similar dynamic was at play in the 2017 general election, where Theresa May’s Conservative government lost its majority to Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party. Once again, the final result was determined by narrow margins in key constituencies.\nAs the election approaches, both major parties are acutely aware of the delicate balance of voter sentiment. A Labour Party source, speaking to The Times, emphasised that the election is far from decided and warned of the dangers of complacency. There is concern within Labour ranks that overly optimistic poll predictions could work against them by suppressing turnout among their supporters.\nThe Labour Party is keen to stress that the desire for change, which appears evident in the country at large, can only be realised if people actually cast their votes for Labour candidates. They are attempting to counter any notion that the election is a foregone conclusion, arguing that abstention or voting for smaller parties could inadvertently lead to a continuation of Conservative governance.\nThis messaging strategy reflects the complex interplay of voter psychology and electoral mathematics. The Conservative Party, for its part, may benefit from a narrative suggesting that Labour’s victory is assured, potentially discouraging Labour supporters from turning out to vote. Conversely, Labour is emphasising the importance of every vote, seeking to mobilise its base by highlighting the perceived risk of another Conservative government.\nHowever, the reality of the situation is more nuanced than either party’s narrative suggests. Given the current polling and the distribution of support across the country, a Conservative government appears unlikely. The more probable outcomes range from a Labour majority of varying sizes to a hung Parliament with Labour as the largest party.\nAs the campaign enters its final stages, the focus on marginal seats will intensify. Candidates and party activists will be redoubling their efforts in these crucial battlegrounds, aware that the outcome in a handful of constituencies could determine the shape of the next government and, by extension, the future direction of the United Kingdom.\nThe electorate, too, finds itself in a position of significant responsibility. In an era often characterised by claims of voter apathy and disillusionment, the 2024 general election serves as a potent reminder of the power of individual votes. The knowledge that a relatively small number of voters could tip the balance in key marginal seats underscores the importance of political engagement and participation.\nAs polling day approaches, the British public will be weighing their options carefully, conscious that their individual decisions could collectively shape the nation’s trajectory for years to come. The outcome remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: in the UK’s first-past-the-post system, every vote truly does count.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-squeezed-middle-how-inactivity-among-young-and-old-is-burdening-working-age-brits/content_622.html": "The Squeezed Middle – How Inactivity Among Young and Old is Burdening Working-Age Brits\nA new alarming report by the former chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, highlights how Britain’s “sandwich generation” of middle-aged workers are being squeezed by rising inactivity among the young and old.\nHaldane, now chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, warns that soaring long-term sickness is putting huge financial and caregiving strains on those aged 35-50. As younger and older generations increasingly drop out of the workforce, the burden is falling heavily on those in the middle.\nThe post-pandemic surge in long-term sickness is forcing middle-aged workers to pay higher taxes and take on far more responsibilities caring for children and elderly parents. The UK has 2.6 million people out of work due to sickness, accounting for nearly 30% of economic inactivity.\nHaldane points to NHS data showing 20% of 17-24-year-olds reported a mental health condition last year. He argues failures in education are contributing to poor job prospects and mental health issues for many young people. Lifetime implications are huge, as health and unemployment problems often persist throughout life.\nEarly retirement during the pandemic has also driven up economic inactivity among 50-64-year-olds by 300,000. The government is pushing to get early retirees back to work to fill labor shortages.\nBut Haldane says the UK’s skill system is “ill-equipped” to retrain older workers. He argues we should view aging as an opportunity, not a threat, to grow the economy.\nWith interest rates rising and recession risks growing, the squeezed middle faces further pain. Haldane warns higher borrowing costs are here to stay, unlike the ultra-low rates of the past 15 years. As rates rise, middle-income families will have less to spend.\nThis combination of trends spells trouble for middle-aged workers who find themselves caught between dependent children and parents, stagnating wages, rising costs, and growing tax burdens. The sandwich generation is carrying the economic burden of young and old. Without action to improve education, health, and skills training, their squeeze will only intensify.\nThe Roots of Youth Inactivity\nThe roots of the youth inactivity crisis highlighted by Haldane lie partly in failures of the education system. Successive governments have overly focused on boosting academic achievement while neglecting the development of broader skills and aptitudes. This has left many young people emerging from school or college woefully unprepared for the world of work.\nMental health support in education has also been inadequate. Schools and universities have struggled with underfunding and lack of prioritization of mental health services. The transition to online learning during the pandemic exacerbated issues of isolation, anxiety, and depression for many students.\nOn top of these systemic issues, the pandemic itself has been hugely detrimental to young people’s employment and mental health. Repeated lockdowns and disruption to education and socialization have scarred an entire generation. The full impacts may not be evident for years to come.\nHaldane argues that current failures will blight young people throughout their lives. Struggling to find work or falling into economic inactivity early on can permanently damage career prospects and earnings potential. It also significantly increases risks of unemployment and poor mental health in the future.\nWith youth inactivity surging, the UK economy is losing out on the dynamism, innovation, and growth that young people can potentially generate. But the sandwich generation is left to pick up the tab.\nRising Burdens from An Aging Population\nWhile failures with youth are partly to blame, inactivity among older segments of the population is also squeezing middle-aged workers.\nWith sustained increases in life expectancy, the UK has seen a dramatic demographic shift towards an aging society. There are now over 12 million people aged 65 and over, accounting for 18% of the total population.\nWhile rising longevity is a positive development overall, it has also led to skills shortages and labor force exits among older workers. Early retirement has been an attractive option for many older people, especially amid the upheaval of the pandemic. But this feeds into a loss of experience and talent from the workforce.\nAlongside this, health challenges associated with aging mean over 2 million people aged 50-64 have dropped out of work for sickness reasons. This adds further pressures for tax-paying workers who must support growing numbers of economically inactive older people.\nAt the same time, middle-aged adults are facing greater burdens caring for elderly parents. Unpaid care work has risen substantially among 45-64 year olds. This “parentcare” often comes on top of ongoing childcare responsibilities.\nHaldane argues the UK’s skill and social care systems are poorly designed to meet the needs of an aging population. Insufficient retraining opportunities mean exits from the labor force are too often permanent. And inadequate social care puts more pressure on middle-aged family members.\nTogether, these trends are squeezing the sandwich generation from both sides. While supporting the young and old, their own needs are being neglected.\nThe Policy Response\nHaldane stresses that inactivity among youth and old age groups will have economic consequences for years to come. Sustained action across education, healthcare, and labor markets is needed to relieve pressure on the sandwich generation.\nOn education, funding for careers guidance, vocational training, and mental health support should be prioritized. Improving services and outcomes for marginalized students could help tackle youth unemployment.\nTo reengage older workers, policies around lifelong learning, retraining opportunities, flexible work, and “unretirement” will be key. Retaining and retraining older staff could boost business productivity while reducing dependency.\nThe government must also invest heavily in healthcare and social care. Improving mental health services for young people and expanding elderly care provision would benefit vulnerable groups while easing family pressures.\nIn terms of labor markets, continued post-pandemic recovery efforts are needed. But supporting flexible opportunities that allow sandwich generation workers to balance work and care is equally important.\nHaldane emphasizes that inactivity among young and old will act as a drag on growth unless addressed. But fresh thinking and investment could turn ageing and youth employment into opportunities. This would relieve the sandwich generation while boosting prosperity.\nPreventing a Squeeze into Poverty\nThere are real risks that the sandwich generation could slide into poverty unless greater support is provided. Middle-aged workers already face stagnating wages, rising living costs, and growing care burdens. Adding further tax rises to support younger and older dependents could cause serious financial hardship.\nWith poor wage growth and weakening job security, middle-income households have little savings to fall back on. Multiple pressures could see many spiral into debt, mortgage stress, and deprivation.\nWomen in midlife are particularly vulnerable, as they tend to take on a disproportionate share of caring duties. Single parents are also at higher risk. There are already over 2 million single parent families in the UK, which could signal significant future child poverty issues.\nFor middle-aged adults close to retirement, falling into economic difficulty now could wreck future pension plans. With savings depleted, ever-increasing numbers of retirees may find themselves dependent on already-stretched welfare systems.\nPreventing widespread poverty among the sandwich generation will require a broad policy approach. Generous childcare provision, elderly social care, flexible work arrangements, midlife training schemes and targeted financial support will all play a role.\nAfter years of underinvestment, the UK must treat the squeezed middle as an urgent priority. Their welfare is tied to that of the younger and older generations they care for. Failure to act now virtually guarantees increased hardship across the age spectrum.\nAn Issue of Intergenerational Fairness\nAt its core, the growing pressure on the sandwich generation is an issue of intergenerational fairness. Younger and older age groups are increasingly reliant on working-age taxpayers to fund their services and benefits. But there is little reciprocity.\nAmid austerity policies, generations entering adulthood have seen key services cut to the bone. From housing to healthcare, costs have been offloaded onto individuals. Elderly groups have been sheltered for longer, but face their own crisis as social care collapses.\nMeanwhile, vital workers in midlife have experienced a decade of wage stagnation and are now hit with tax rises, inflation, and rising care bills. As the Bank of England chief economist makes clear, this is unsustainable.\nA fairer distribution of costs and opportunities is urgently required. The generational divide has been exacerbated by short-term policymaking. The wider social contract between young, middle-aged and elderly needs repairing.\nThis will mean asking all groups to contribute more. But it should also bring greater security for all. Quality education and employment for youth, expanded care services for the elderly, and decent pay and respite for midlife workers must be the shared objectives.\nOnly by balancing responsibilities and privileges across society can we prevent families and individuals from slipping through the cracks. Robust and far-sighted policies can ease pressures on the sandwich generation and set the UK on a path to intergenerational justice. But decades of neglect and misprioritization will be hard to overcome.\nConclusion\nThe Bank of England’s stark warning on rising youth and elderly inactivity reveals a generation under strain. As the UK’s population ages and gaps in education, mental healthcare and skills training leave many young people marginalized, middle-aged workers are picking up the tab.\nOnly a comprehensive policy approach focused on improving education and skills, investing in healthcare and social care, generating flexible job opportunities, and easing cost of living pressures can prevent millions of families from sliding into poverty.\nWith intergenerational fairness breaking down, a new social contract is needed to share costs and opportunities more equally. After years of austerity and underinvestment, reversing this painful squeeze on working-age adults must now become a priority. Supporting the sandwich generation is critical for Britain’s economy and society.",

This significant development in immigration policy represents a marked shift in the government’s approach to asylum seekers with criminal convictions.\nUnder the forthcoming legislation, ministers will be granted enhanced powers to exclude any foreign nationals convicted of sexual offences—whether in the UK or abroad—from protection under the Refugee Convention, even in cases where the sentence imposed was less than 12 months in duration.\nThe practical implication of this legislative change means that the Home Office will possess the authority to deport such convicted individuals, effectively placing them in the same category as terrorists, war criminals, and other ‘serious’ offenders who are deemed to constitute a ‘danger to the community’.\nPolitical analysts suggest that this more stringent stance on immigration could be interpreted as an attempt by the Labour Party to prevent its traditional voters from defecting to Reform UK ahead of the local council elections scheduled for Thursday. The timing of the announcement has raised eyebrows amongst political commentators, who note the strategic value of such policy pronouncements in the immediate run-up to polling day.\nThis policy development follows revelations by The Telegraph newspaper, which highlighted several troubling cases wherein foreign nationals convicted of sex offences either successfully avoided deportation from the United Kingdom or were granted asylum despite their criminal histories.\nThe proposed legislation will apply with equal force to migrants currently in the process of claiming asylum and to existing refugees, who could potentially have their refugee status revoked should they be convicted of sexual offences.\nHome Secretary’s Commitment to Reform\nYvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, offered a robust defence of the new measures, stating: “We are restoring order to a broken asylum system that has been mired in delay and dysfunction for far too long, and we are strengthening our system to make sure that the rules are respected and enforced.\n“Sex offenders who pose a risk to the community should not be allowed to benefit from refugee protections in the UK. We are strengthening the law to ensure these appalling crimes are taken seriously.”\nMs Cooper elaborated further on the financial implications of the current system, adding: “Nor should asylum seekers be stuck in hotels at the taxpayers’ expense during lengthy legal battles. That is why we are changing the law to help clear the backlog, end the use of asylum hotels and save billions of pounds for the taxpayer.”\nLegal Framework and Challenges\nIt is important to note that whilst the new legislation represents a significant policy shift, foreign sex offenders will retain the right to appeal against both their asylum rejection and potential removal from the United Kingdom through immigration tribunals, invoking protections under the European Convention on Human Rights.\nNevertheless, ministerial sources indicate confidence that courts will be more inclined to sanction deportation in such cases because tribunals will be required to determine whether, as ‘serious criminals’, the threat posed by these individuals to public safety outweighs their human rights claims relating to family life or the risk of persecution should they be returned to their country of origin.\nThe new powers will be introduced through amendments to Labour’s asylum Bill, having received formal approval from Lord Hermer, the Attorney General, who has confirmed that the measures are compliant with international law. Despite this official endorsement, it is widely anticipated that the amendments will face robust challenges from immigration lawyers and asylum seekers themselves.\nOrigins of the Policy\nReliable sources within the Labour Party suggest that these plans were initially drafted approximately a year ago, following the case of Abdul Ezedi, the perpetrator of a horrific chemical attack in Clapham. Ezedi had been granted asylum in the United Kingdom despite previously receiving two consecutive suspended jail sentences—each of less than 12 months’ duration—for sexual assault and indecent exposure.\nIn January 2024, Ezedi attacked a 31-year-old woman and her children with a corrosive substance, inflicting life-changing injuries. Following an extensive manhunt, his body was subsequently recovered from the River Thames.\nEfficiency Measures and Backlog Reduction\nAs part of a broader strategy to reform the asylum system, the Home Office has established an ambitious new target to render decisions on appeals lodged by asylum seekers and foreign offenders within 24 weeks—representing a 50 per cent reduction from the current average processing time of nearly 50 weeks.\nThe department aims to address and resolve a record backlog of 41,987 applicants who have submitted appeals, many of whom are currently housed in accommodation provided at the expense of British taxpayers, including hotels and other temporary residences.\nStatistical Context and International Comparisons\nPrevious investigative reporting by The Telegraph revealed that foreign nationals were responsible for up to 23 per cent of sexual offences, including rape, committed in the United Kingdom between 2021 and 2023. It should be noted that this figure includes 8 per cent of perpetrators whose nationalities were recorded as unknown in official statistics.\nUnder the provisions of the 2007 Borders Act, any foreign national who receives a custodial sentence exceeding one year faces automatic deportation from the United Kingdom. The current legislative framework, particularly the Refugee Convention, permits protection from deportation to be withheld if an individual is convicted of what is termed a ‘particularly serious crime’.\nThe Government’s proposed amendment to its Bill will establish a legal presumption that individuals convicted of sexual offences will be denied such protections. This would encompass all ‘schedule three’ offences under the 2003 Sex Offences Act, ranging from sexual assault to possession of indecent images and indecent exposure.\nCase Studies Highlighting Current Challenges\nThe Telegraph has brought attention to several notable cases that illustrate the complexities and perceived shortcomings of the existing system. One particularly controversial example involved an Afghan sex offender who successfully avoided deportation after his legal representatives argued that his treatment of women would potentially expose him to ‘mob violence’ if he were returned to his home country.\nThe 31-year-old asylum seeker had been sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment for ‘outraging public decency and exposure’ and was subsequently placed on the sex offenders’ register for a period of seven years. Despite these convictions, he was granted refugee status and permitted to remain in the United Kingdom after contending that denying him asylum would constitute a breach of his human rights.\nPolitical Opposition and Legal Expert Reactions\nChris Philp, the shadow Home Secretary, expressed scepticism regarding Labour’s announcement, dismissing it as a political manoeuvre lacking substantive merit.\n“This is a piece of desperate pre-election performance,” Mr Philp remarked. “The fact is that foreign criminals frequently use human rights, not just asylum claims, to stay in the UK. Yet just a few weeks ago, Labour voted against a Conservative amendment to disapply the Human Rights Act from immigration matters, including foreign criminals.”\nRichard Ekins, professor of law at the University of Oxford and head of Policy Exchange’s Judicial Power Project, offered a more positive assessment of the proposed measures, whilst suggesting that the Government could adopt an even more assertive approach.\nProfessor Ekins advocated for the expulsion of any refugee who posed a risk to public order, explicitly including those who entered the United Kingdom illegally from countries in which they were not facing imminent danger.\n“What remains to be seen is exactly how this new change is implemented and in particular whether the Government is prepared to face down the inevitable human rights law challenge,” Professor Ekins added, highlighting the likely legal battles that lie ahead.\nTechnological Solutions and Future Developments\nIn a parallel development aimed at modernising asylum processing, it has been announced that asylum caseworkers will be equipped with artificial intelligence tools to help address the substantial backlog of pending cases and streamline the application procedure.\nIt is anticipated that these technological enhancements will expedite caseworkers’ access to relevant country-specific advice and information, whilst also facilitating the summarisation of extensive interview transcripts, thereby improving operational efficiency throughout the asylum determination process.\nHistorical Context of UK Asylum Policy\nThe United Kingdom has a complex history regarding asylum policy, which has evolved considerably over recent decades. The 1951 Refugee Convention, to which the UK is a signatory, established the fundamental framework for refugee protection, defining a refugee as someone who has fled their country due to a well-founded fear of persecution.\nThroughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, successive British governments have introduced various legislative measures aimed at balancing humanitarian obligations with concerns about immigration control and national security. The Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004 all represented significant developments in this evolving policy landscape.\nPublic Opinion and Media Coverage\nPublic attitudes towards asylum seekers in the United Kingdom remain divided. Various polling organisations have consistently found that immigration and asylum issues rank amongst the most important concerns for British voters. Media coverage of asylum issues often focuses on controversial cases, particularly those involving criminality or perceived abuses of the system.\nThe current government appears to be responding to public concerns about the integrity of the asylum system, particularly in relation to individuals with criminal convictions. Critics argue that sensationalist media coverage has contributed to negative perceptions of asylum seekers, whilst advocates for refugee rights emphasise that the vast majority of those seeking protection are fleeing genuine persecution and pose no threat to British society.\nInternational Obligations and Diplomatic Considerations\nThe United Kingdom’s approach to asylum policy exists within a complex web of international obligations and diplomatic relationships. As a signatory to various international conventions and treaties, including the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK must balance its sovereign right to control immigration with its responsibilities under international law.\nThe proposed legislation to bar sex offenders from gaining asylum represents a test case for how the UK interprets its international obligations in the post-Brexit era. Legal experts suggest that the government will need to demonstrate that its new approach remains compatible with these international commitments, even as it seeks to strengthen immigration controls and deportation mechanisms.\nEconomic Implications and Resource Allocation\nThe financial cost of processing asylum applications and supporting asylum seekers whilst their claims are considered represents a significant expenditure for the British government. The use of hotels and other temporary accommodation has been particularly controversial, with critics arguing that this represents poor value for money for taxpayers.\nBy expediting the processing of appeals and clarifying the grounds for exclusion from refugee protection, the government hopes to reduce these costs substantially. However, implementing the new system effectively will require significant investment in training, technology, and administrative capacity within the Home Office and related agencies.\nConclusion: A Balancing Act\nThe government’s proposed changes to asylum legislation regarding foreign sex offenders highlight the ongoing challenge of balancing various competing interests: protecting vulnerable refugees, maintaining public safety, controlling immigration, meeting international obligations, and managing public resources efficiently.\nAs the legislation progresses through Parliament and faces potential legal challenges, the debate will continue about how best to achieve these sometimes conflicting objectives. What is clear is that asylum policy remains a deeply contested area of British politics, reflecting broader questions about national identity, security, and humanitarian values in contemporary society.\nComment\nThe safety of the British public has been put at risk by successive administrations for years, with their unilateral determination to enforce open-borders, without any consideration to the safety of its citizens.\nThere are laws in place in the UK which have been implemented after victims went to a lot of effort to fight for them, such as Claire’s law and Sarah’s law, but how are these laws able to protect people, if an increasing number of people in the UK, which is now in the millions, have arrived here from other countries and we know absolutely nothing about them.\nUltimately the responsibility for this rests with the globalists who have no consideration whatsoever for the general public.",

The United Kingdom does not need the supervision of an arrogant and irrelevant overseas organisation to keep our human rights in check, we are as you all know the nation which introduced human rights to the world in the first place.\nI would put it to you, that the ECHR, along with the other globalist institutions which I will also cover, are little more than tools of the elitist political classes, who are determined to erode the power of the nation state and increasingly shift control to their puppets, in their quest for a globalist society controlled by them.\nWe have criminals in the UK who openly express their plans to conspire against our country, in the full knowledge that they are able to use the ECHR to prevent the government from deporting them and in parallel, we have leaders who do not have the fortitude, the will or the moral compass to fight for the citizens of the very nation that they have been elected to represent.\nNo matter what the globalists, the woke brigade, the treacherous element of our society who seek to undermine our nation may say, we must leave the ECHR post haste.\nWe elect our leaders in good faith that they will act in the best interest of the United Kingdom, but sadly, their actions are more in keeping with TREASON than PATRIOTISM.\nSummary\n• The UK government should free itself from globalist institutions to lead effectively\n• The UK must leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)\n• The ECHR judges are “arrogant” and “pseudo-judges”\n• Many European nations ignore ECHR rulings\n• Turkey’s ECHR membership contradicts its human rights record\n• The US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are not ECHR members but have better human rights records than Turkey\n• The UK is credited with introducing human rights to the world\n• The ECHR and similar institutions are described as tools of globalist elites\n• Criminals in the UK use ECHR to avoid deportation\n• UK leaders are criticised for lacking the will to fight for citizens’ interests\n• The evidence strongly advocates for leaving the ECHR\n• Current leadership actions are more treasonous than patriotic",

Priti Patel has the support of just 3 per cent of members.\nMr Stafford, who was elected as part of Boris Johnson’s 2019 victory, lost his seat by 998 votes.\nEven though he had one of the smallest swings against him of any sitting Conservative MP, he lost in part because of the intervention of Reform UK.\nWriting for The Telegraph (see below), Mr Stafford urged the party not to rush into a leadership contest, and said the membership must be involved.\n“Whilst we are fortunate to have several good candidates who are considering putting their name forward, there is a clear front runner who can slay the Reform dragon – Kemi Badenoch,” he said.\n“Having been her parliamentary private secretary for the past 18 months, I witnessed first-hand how hardworking, principled, and above all an embodiment of Conservatism she is.\n“From speaking out against the high levels of immigration, to starting the downfall of the SNP by stopping the Scottish gender recognition reform bill, Kemi repeatedly proves she knows what resonates with the public, and how to use it to thwart our political opponents.\n“It is essential she comes forward and throws her hat into the ring for the leadership of our party.”\nMs Badenoch is now shadow housing secretary – a position she requested so she can square up against Angela Rayner.\nMs Rayner, who as well as being Deputy Prime Minister is also Housing Secretary, wants to bring in a new race equality act that would enshrine in law the right to equal pay for people from ethnic minorities.\nMs Badenoch has in the past said this equates to South African apartheid, with workers “classified by race”.\n‘Race is wide open’\nThe Conservative Home website showed that 16 per cent of members still did not know whom they would support.\nHenry Hill, the website’s deputy editor, said: “Conservative leadership contests normally end up with a candidate of the Right versus a candidate of the centre, which on these results would likely mean a final round between Tom Tugendhat and either Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick.\n“But with ‘don’t know’ the second-largest group, and a wide spread of support between potential candidates, at this stage the race is wide open.”\nMr Stafford said Labour’s majority was “built on sand”. He added: “What is clear is that again and again seats were lost as the traditional Right-leaning vote share was split between the Conservatives and Reform.\n“If only a fraction of the Reform vote had gone to the Conservatives, tens of seats, including my own, would have stayed blue.\n“We must never allow the Right to split again. If that happens, the Right loses, and so does the country.”\nPeople voted for Reform because they felt overlooked by both the Conservative and Labour parties, he said.\n“Whether it is on law and order, taxation, welfare, and especially immigration, for too long, we have talked Right but governed Left on the issues that matter most to people in the country,” he added.\n“It is our job over the next five years to win these people back.

This concept is named after the economist who developed it, Arthur Laffer, a prominent American economist who has taught at the University of Chicago, the University of Southern California, and elsewhere. The Laffer Curve illustrates two crucial things we need to understand about taxes: how much revenue the government can raise from taxes and at what level of taxation the government might start receiving less, not more, revenue.\nThe Laffer Curve is represented by a two-dimensional graph. The horizontal axis is the tax rate that the government chooses, and the vertical axis is the revenue the government receives from that tax rate. First, because zero times any number is zero, if the tax rate is zero, the government receives zero revenue. Accordingly, the point (0,0) is the first point on the curve.\nNow, suppose the government chooses a very small tax rate, say 1 percent. The government will then begin to receive some revenue from citizens. This means that another point on the curve must be something like (1,y), where y is a small positive number. If the government charges a 2 percent tax rate, everyone would agree that it will receive even more revenue – which means that another point on the curve must be something like (2,z), where z is a larger positive number than y.\nIf the government keeps raising the rate, revenue will continue to increase, at least when we’re in the low-tax-rate part of the graph. This means that the curve has an upward slope in this region. However, suppose the government charges a 100% tax rate. In this case, no one would work because the government would take all their earnings. If no one works, the national income will be zero, which means the government revenue will be 100% of zero, or zero. This means that another point on the curve must be (100,0).\nNow, when we complete the curve, we see that it must have a hump shape. This is simply because the revenue line has to go up in the low tax rate part of the graph and has to start going down to reach the point we drew at the 100 percent tax rate. If the curve slopes downward, it implies something remarkable – something that few proponents of higher taxes want to admit.\nIt means that when tax rates are high, if you increase them further, you’ll actually bring in less revenue to the government. This has, in fact, occurred in practice. For instance, during the Great Depression, when Congress passed the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, although the act raised taxes on imported goods, the revenue from those taxes actually decreased.\nA more recent example occurred in the early 1980s. After President Reagan and Congress drastically reduced tax rates on the rich, the tax revenue from the rich actually increased. All economists – even the most left-wing ones – agree that the true Laffer Curve, the one that reflects real life, has a hump, and that therefore the curve has a downward-sloping part, meaning at some point, tax revenues start going down when you increase rates.\nSo where do economists disagree? They disagree about exactly where the hump occurs. When I took my first economics class in 1984 at Stanford University, the textbook said that the hump occurs somewhere around the 70% tax rate. But apparently, I was taught something wrong! New evidence from an unexpected source suggests that the hump occurs at a much lower tax rate, something around 33 percent.\nThat source is a study by Christina Romer and her husband David Romer. Both are economics professors at the University of California, Berkeley. Christina Romer was the chairwoman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. In other words, the study was written by one of the most influential liberal economists in the United States.\nThe study was published in the American Economic Review, the most widely respected economics journal in the world. This study examined how national income responds to tax rates. But as far as what concerns us here, the key point is that, if you do the maths, the results imply that the hump on the Laffer Curve occurs where the tax rate is around 33 percent – much lower than economists previously thought.\nLet’s now put these findings into political terms. They suggest that, no matter what your politics, you should not want tax rates to be above 33 percent. Obviously, conservatives and many moderates think rates should be lower than that. But even if you are an extreme left-winger and your only goal is to make the government as big as possible, you should still oppose a tax rate higher than 33 percent. The reason is that, as the Romer and Romer study suggests, when tax rates go higher than that, the government actually gets less money.\nEveryone, regardless of their political persuasion, should pay attention to the Romer and Romer study and its important implications. They suggest that if we decrease tax rates, government revenues might actually rise.\nWhat is the moral of the story?\nThe tax rates in the UK were extremely high in the past, in the 1970s, the highest rate of income tax on earned income was 83 per cent. Margaret Thatcher’s government reduced it to 60 per cent in 1980 and 40 per cent in 1989 (equal to the higher rate). From 1989 to 2010, the highest rate of income tax remained at 40 per cent and this was not a live political issue.\nAs the tax rates began to fall, the revenue that was collected began to rise, but in order for this to be effective over the long term, the government must ensure that the political and economical climate is conducive to commercial investment. The mistake that most governments make with income tax, is two fold:\nFirstly, where there has been an economic downturn and the revenue collected begins to fall, the quick-fix, is to raise taxes to plug the gap, now that may work in the first year, maybe even in the second year, but by the third year, investment will fall, people will have less incentive to earn, or expand their businesses and the revenue falls again. Should the government be tempted to plunder the taxpayers once again, which has been done in the past, the downward spiral begins to accelerate and the economy sinks in to serious decline.\nHowever, where leaders have had the courage to reduce taxes, the opposite happens, there is increased investment, growth, income and subsequently more tax revenue, but there is one problem here that leaders face in the modern day, that is the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) which was introduced by George Osborne, to prevent a similar situation that was left by the departing Labour government in 2010.\nThe problem is, that the OBR has overstepped the mark in recent years, not to mention the fact that it is consistently wrong, in fact, since it was created it has been wrong to the tune of £548 BILLION! it was also responsible for creating the panic in the markets when tax cuts were announced by Kwasi Kwertang in 2022. He along with Liz Truss should have been aware of the risk that the OBR would do this and should not have been so premature with their plans, because as far as the OBR was concerned, these were unfunded tax cuts, but that is because the multiplication factor is not taken in to account by the OBR, which basically means that lower taxes, creates more spending, which generates more revenue and so on. They should have approached this with extreme caution, but as a result of not doing so, the markets went in to freefall and the rest we know.\nThe other issue is vanity taxes, which is punishing higher earners in order to win favour with the masses, but take this in to account.\n10% of taxpayers, pay 60% of all income tax (up from only 35% in 1978)\nWhat would happen if that 10% decided to move their businesses to another country? Even 3 or 4% of them leaving would be catastrophic, but once again, this is a real and present danger.\nOn top of this, there are many people in what is called “the welfare trap”\nThey cannot afford to come off benefits, but if they work, they lose so much, that they are effectively working for nothing, and regardless of the ethics, this is the reality, people need incentives and a government that can incentivise the nation will ultimately create a more efficient economy and generate more revenue, which will lessen the burden on everyone, which will in turn, offer further incentive to succeed.\nI sometimes wonder if these people understand that a large part of the workforce and even the business world can relocate very easily and lockdown has accelerated this, as more people realised that if they could run their business from home, they could also run it from overseas and not pay these ridiculous tax rates that we have in the UK.",

And that means taking a step back, taking a deep breath and remaining clear-headed.\nWith that being said, here are a few things we need to remember now and always.\n1- “This Too Shall Pass”\nIf COVID-19 is causing in you feelings of fear, panic, and anxiety, please repeat to yourself this timeless saying: “This too shall pass”. Because it will.\nIn 1858, Abraham Lincoln famously recounted:\n“It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: “And this, too, shall pass away.” How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride! How consoling in the depths of affliction!\nOften found in wisdom literature of the ancient Near East, the adage “this too shall pass” aptly sums up the unconditionally temporary nature of human condition. It is a reminder that every single event in human history, whether it is a negative or a positive one, inevitably becomes a thing of the past. And, although there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel right now, this virus will also inevitably become a thing of the past.\nThe only question is “when?”. Not unlike all other living things in the world, epidemics rise, peak and decline. Sooner or later, this thing will peak and it will decline. In the past decades, SARS and H1N1 caused a great deal of panic. However, the only thing they are infecting now is history books.\nWhile current world events might seem overwhelming, we still have full control of ourselves and our surroundings. Which leads me to my next point.\n2- You Don’t Need Up-to-the-Minute News Updates\nIf you can take away one thing from this site is that critical thinking is required when dealing with mass media. Sometimes, it doesn’t have our best interest at heart and, sometimes, it is even outright toxic. As people are confined to their homes with little to do, the urge to keep up with the news is constant. However, not all news is good to consume. Some of it actually is vile, toxic crap.\nFor instance, an article in Canada’s National Post titled What might our lives look like when Canada is in the full grip of COVID-19? dug up an obscure report dating from 2009, quoted its grimmest parts and linked them to what is happening now. I will spare you the details, but the article talks about things such as “stockpiling body bags, choosing a central place where people bring corpses of family members and identifying hockey and curling rinks cold enough to be temporary morgue sites”.\nThe article brought forth no useful information, just wild speculations that poke on people’s latent fears. Gladly, not every reader lapped up the unnecessary fear-mongering. Here are two comments from the article.\nAnother article from another Canadian publication titled Cancel your March Break straight-up begins with these words:\n“Fear is the right reaction to the coronavirus”.\nI’m sorry, but no. The only time that fear is the “right reaction” is when a bear is chasing you and you need the adrenaline boost to outrun it. In the case of a global crisis with lots of moving parts that require careful planning, fear is not the “right reaction”. Fear leads to panic-induced, irrational decisions. And a prolonged state of fear can be extremely damaging for one’s mental health.\nAfter a whole lot of fear-mongering, the article ends with these words:\n“Be afraid. Be very afraid.”\nI’m sorry, but no. Now, more than ever, we need to remain calm, rational and level-headed. And limiting our daily intake of “panic news” is a great start. Trust me, I know that it is difficult to resist the urge to grab one’s phone and look-up news articles about the virus. I sometimes find myself doing it without even realizing it. But it is simply not healthy or even necessary to do so.\nYou don’t need to get a mild panic attack each time the number of confirmed cases goes up a notch. You don’t need to mildly despair each time an artist cancels a world tour. More importantly, if you have children, they don’t need to see you turn into a panicky shell of a person. Which leads me to my final point.\n3- Life Goes On\nIf you look outside, the sun is still rising and birds are still chirping. You are still on this Earth and you still have one life to live. Even if you are in lockdown, quarantine or whatever else, you are still in control of yourself and your surroundings. You still need to sleep well, eat healthily and exercise regularly. If you’re stuck at home, put down your phone for a while and use this time to take care of your people, read a good book, work on creative projects and, if possible, go outside and seek the healing presence of nature. Coincidentally enough, in my annual end-of-year articles, I constantly suggest readers to do these exact things. That’s because, despite the constant noise of mass media, the most important things in life happen outside of it.\nWhile this advice might sound extremely boring and generic, this is what needs to be done right now in order to remain vigilant citizens. We need to remain sharp and focused, not weak and fearful. Because, at this point, it doesn’t matter where this virus comes from, what (or who) is behind it and how dangerous it really is. It already managed to shut down the entire world.\nSoon, we will need to ask some important questions: Who benefitted from this situation? Who went for a power grab? What kind of companies weathered the storm? Where did the world economy shift to? What kind of local and global policies were introduced?\nTo properly answer these questions, we need to remain strong and watchful. Because, no matter what happens in the next months … this too shall pass.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-eu-needs-expansion-to-survive/content_755.html": "The EU needs expansion to survive\nThe Future of EU Enlargement: Ambitious Goals and Complex Realities\nIntroduction\nIn a recent speech by Charles Michel, the former President of the European Council, the topic of European Union (EU) enlargement took center stage. Michel called for the EU to expand and welcome new members by 2030, deeming it both ambitious and necessary. With countries from the Balkans to Eastern Europe and the Caucasus expressing their desire to join the EU, the bloc’s current membership of 27 could potentially grow to 36. This renewed focus on EU enlargement comes in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking a significant shift in attitudes towards expansion. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the aspiring EU member states, explore the reasons for the slow progress up until now, analyze the changing attitudes, and assess the likelihood of new members joining in the near future.\nThe Aspiring EU Member States\nLet’s first take a closer look at the countries seeking EU membership. The Western Balkans group includes Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia. Plans to integrate Western Balkan countries into the EU trace back to a 2003 summit where EU member states affirmed that the future of the Balkans belongs within the European Union. Another group aspiring to join the EU is the Association Trio, consisting of Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. These three countries formally applied for EU membership following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe Slow Progress and Complicated Process\nWhy has EU enlargement been such a sluggish process? Firstly, the EU accession process is intricate and lengthy. A country must first meet specific criteria to attain candidate status. Then, existing EU members must unanimously agree to initiate formal negotiations based on an agreed framework. Throughout these negotiations, the aspiring member must align its administrative and institutional infrastructure with EU standards across various areas, including justice, security, agriculture, taxation, and competition. These significant reforms, coupled with numerous disputes that require resolution before entry, have contributed to the sluggish progress.\nFor instance, North Macedonia only resolved its naming dispute with Greece in 2019 and settled a separate dispute with Bulgaria in 2022. These disputes have also stalled Albania’s accession, as its candidacy is tied to North Macedonia’s. Kosovo’s path to EU membership faces hurdles due to the fact that five EU members, including Spain, Greece, and Romania, do not recognize Kosovo’s independence.\nLack of Enthusiasm for Expansion\nBeyond the complexities of the accession process, there has been a notable lack of enthusiasm for expansion among existing EU member states. This hesitance is fueled by several factors. The 2004 Eastward expansion brought in countries like Poland and Hungary, which have faced criticism for failing to uphold EU standards on democracy and the rule of law. Consequently, some Western European states are reluctant to admit new members.\nHowever, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has reignited discussions about EU enlargement. Expansion is no longer merely a political matter; it has become a moral imperative for the EU. Many within the EU now believe that keeping potential members, such as Serbia, waiting for so long makes them vulnerable to Russian influence.\nThe Timeline Dilemma\nWhile there is a renewed enthusiasm for enlargement, the timeline remains uncertain. Charles Michel proposed enlarging the EU by 2030, but the European Commission downplayed this by emphasizing a merit-based approach rather than setting a fixed date. The EU also rejected Ukraine’s request for a fast-tracked accession process. This internal debate on how to approach enlargement will come to a head in the coming months.\nThe Need for EU Reform\nTo add to the complexity, the EU itself requires significant reform before admitting new members. The current EU structure is not designed to accommodate 30-something member states. Some EU countries, including France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, advocate for a shift to qualified majority voting to expedite decision-making and prevent individual states from holding policies hostage.\nThe EU will need to address pressing questions about how to handle new members’ entry, including potential changes to the European Parliament, budget adjustments, and agricultural policy reforms. These issues will be pivotal in shaping the future of EU enlargement.\nConclusion\nEU enlargement has faced numerous challenges over the years, but recent geopolitical shifts have brought it back into focus. While the EU expresses ambition and determination to expand, many obstacles remain, both within the aspiring member countries and within the EU itself. The next few months will prove crucial in determining the direction of EU enlargement, and the outcomes of upcoming meetings and summits will be closely watched. Achieving the goal of enlargement by 2030 may be ambitious, but it’s a goal that reflects the evolving priorities and challenges of the European Union on the world stage.",

This has not been by accident, but I believe it has been done by design. In fact, the powers that be, have used all sorts of events to justify the creeping changes that have engulfed us over recent years.\nHave no doubt that this happening for the reasons that we are told, this is not for the greater good, this is a monster’s tentacles, slowly stifling our very right to live the way our forefathers fought for us to be able to live.\nThere are so many incremental changes that are gradually taking us down the road the a dystopian society, that I could not possibly mention all here, but here are a few individually minor, but collectively significant changes that have happened since the nineties.\n- Following the detonation of an IRA bomb, the prime minister at the time, John Major, introduced a bill, denying terrorists the right to silence, with Judges being allowed to infer that a defendant’s silence could be considered an admission of guilt, thereby directing the Jury to find the defendant guilty. The masses supported this, after all, why should terrorists be allowed to hide behind silence? However, this was the thin end of the wedge, because when nobody was looking, Terrorists right to silence, was modified slightly, but that was significant.\n- The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, went further than the previous act, denying criminals the right to silence, Part III, sections 34–39 which substantially changed the right to silence of an accused person, allowing for inferences to be drawn from their silence. That meant that anyone accused of a crime, could either speak up and possibly incriminate themselves, or be considered guilty by keeping silent.\n- The introduction of the speed camera. Although the first speed camera was actually installed on the M40 Motorway. west of London, it was a few years before there was an explosion of them, but either way, the masses did not consider the implications of this. For the first time, since the Magna Carta, the citizens of this country had gone from innocent until proved guilty, to guilty until proven innocent, the changes above will be regarded as revolutionary in years to come, if we are allowed to actually discuss them by then.\nWhat does this have to do with our every day lives?\nThis and the subsequent incremental changes have a lot to do with our daily lives, we have not even noticed the veil of autocracy that has engulfed us, but rest assured that it has, in so many ways, from the ability to protest, express opinions, or even question the workings of our government, who use the official secrets act as a ‘get out of jail free card’\nAs we are all aware, we have recently suffered a pandemic, with countries around the world, seizing the opportunity to introduce draconian laws, in order to ‘protect us’\nCreate a problem – Terrify the nation – Offer a solution\nThe standard gameplay of modern politics, the reason we invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and many more. If there is no enemy, there is less reason for them to be taking drastic measures to safeguard the nation.\nWe may be under the impression that we are living in the free world, perhaps less restricted than some of course, but we are far from free, our right to an opinion is rapidly being taken from us. We are forced to pander to minorities that the government does not actually care about, but rather exploiting, so that they can use their cause, issues or fears, to silence the rest of us, then gradually, rule by rule, legal act by legal act, we are being socially imprisoned by what seems to be our own choice.",

The hostile agenda behind this movement has been merciless with anyone who would dare to display any objection to this unnatural surgical procedure, that they demand, will give them the right to swap gender, it does not!\nFor those of us who do not have any confusion with our gender identity, it may be hard to understand how that would feel, but we have already seen people who have had surgery admit that they were wrong to have done so.\nThe real question is, why is the media determined to give so much publicity and support, to such a small minority?\nIn the order of things, those who do decide to take such drastic action are such a small minority that they should not really even factor in to issues that the politicians should waste their time with.\nOne thing is for certain, it may well be acceptable for people to identify as another gender, be it psychologically or physically, but I completely disagree with trans men, being able to officially become women, they are not women, they are ‘surgically modified men’ and always will be.\nThe notion that a trans man can compete with women is not only a non-starter, it is also setting an extremely dangerous precedent. What would happen if a trans man was able to compete with a woman in a contact sport like boxing? Men and women are equal, but different, nothing will change that and why should that change?\nThe recent swimming competition winner Lia Thomas was the greatest demonstration of disrespect to women in decades. It may be, that in recent decades, the world has been so wrapped up with rights rather than obligations, but with regard to women, I would say that the obsession with rights has overtaken the equally, or more important notion of respect for women.\nIf we do not address this, we face the real possibility of men being permitted to use women’s toilets, trans men being locked up with a woman in prison, the slippery slope that has absolutely no regard for that which is morally right.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_free-speech-organisation-ejected-from-brighton-public-house/content_281.html": "Free Speech Organisation Ejected from Brighton Public House\nGroup ordered to leave following Remarks on Trans Ideology Education for Children\nThe Southern Belle, a prominent establishment in Brighton, reportedly ordered the departure of 50 members belonging to Free Speech Brighton, as alleged by the organisation\nA collective dedicated to the preservation of free expression has asserted that they were unceremoniously removed from a public house after voicing the opinion that youngsters ought not to be instructed in trans ideology within educational settings.\nApproximately half a hundred members of Free Speech Brighton were purportedly commanded to vacate the premises of The Southern Belle, a well-regarded hotel and public house situated in the heart of the seaside city, amidst an evening of impassioned orations on Tuesday last, as claimed by the organisation in question.\nIt is said that the proprietor of the establishment took umbrage at one of the speeches delivered, which touched upon the contentious subject of imparting gender ideology within the hallowed halls of academia. Consequently, it is alleged that the landlord instructed the security personnel to expel the entire assemblage forthwith.\nWhen approached for comment on the incident, the public house steadfastly declined to offer any elucidation. Similarly, Pagoda Security, the firm responsible for maintaining order on the premises, remained conspicuously silent when contacted by the esteemed journalists of The Telegraph.\nFree Speech Brighton, a subsidiary organisation of the more widely recognised Free Speech Union, had taken the prudent step of reserving a private function room within the public house for their gathering. The group had come prepared with the necessary accoutrements for public discourse, including a microphone and loudspeaker, to facilitate the delivery of speeches by their esteemed members.\nFor the edification of our readers, it behoves us to note that the Free Speech Union, an organisation that came into being in the year 2020, tirelessly campaigns for the inalienable right to freedom of expression. Moreover, this noble institution extends its support to individuals who find themselves in the unenviable position of having to defend their rights before the courts of law.\nThe inaugural address of the evening was delivered by a retired educator, who proffered the opinion that “gender ideology” – a belief system predicated on the notion that gender exists beyond the binary and may diverge from one’s assigned sex at birth – ought not to be disseminated to pupils of tender years within the confines of educational establishments.\nSources close to the matter have intimated to The Telegraph that the lady in question, a quinquagenarian of some repute, held forth for a quarter of an hour. During her discourse, she passionately argued that parents should adopt a more inquisitive stance regarding the nature of sexual education imparted to their offspring. Furthermore, she advocated for parental access to the educational materials employed in such lessons.\nAs the speaker was in the midst of fielding enquiries from her attentive audience, it is alleged that a quintet of security guards made an abrupt ingress into the room, demanding that the assembled company take their leave forthwith.\n“We Were Peremptorily Ordered to Depart”\nLaura King, the esteemed chairperson of the group, took to the social media platform Facebook to recount the distressing events of the evening. She wrote, “We were startled by the sudden influx of security personnel into our private function room, peremptorily ordering us to depart the premises post-haste.”\nShe continued, “I attempted to reason with them, explaining that we had only just concluded listening to that particular speech and that there were two additional orations scheduled on entirely disparate subjects. However, they remained intransigent, insisting that the landlord had decreed our immediate expulsion.”\n“One of the security guards went so far as to attempt to forcibly remove the loudspeaker from the room, heedless of the fact that it remained connected to the mains electricity supply,” Ms King added, painting a vivid picture of the chaotic scene.\nVisual evidence of the altercation, which has since been widely disseminated across various social media platforms, appears to depict a member of the security detail attempting to forcibly remove the microphone and loudspeaker from the premises. This action was met with vociferous objections from the assembled members of the free speech group.\nIn the recorded footage, the security guard can be heard asserting that any individual who refuses to comply with the order to vacate the premises would be considered to be “trespassing” on private property.\nMs King further elucidated that the group “stood our ground for a brief period” and insisted upon finishing their libations before reluctantly taking their leave of the establishment.\nThe incident has provoked a maelstrom of outrage across various social media platforms, with many decrying what they perceive as an egregious assault on the fundamental right to free expression. In response to this perceived slight, the Free Speech Union has issued a stern ultimatum to the public house, threatening legal action unless the proprietor issues a formal apology and permits the group to reschedule their meeting at the earliest convenience.\n“Their Beliefs Are Entirely Lawful”\nToby Young, the director of the Free Speech Union, offered his perspective on the matter, stating, “From a legal standpoint, the landlord’s position is utterly untenable.”\nHe continued, “It is not within his rights to evict patrons solely on the grounds that he disapproves of their entirely lawful beliefs, particularly when said beliefs enjoy protection under the auspices of the Equality Act.”\nMr Young drew a striking parallel to underscore the gravity of the situation, asserting, “In the eyes of the law, this incident is tantamount to expelling an individual on the basis of their race or sexual orientation. It constitutes unlawful discrimination, plain and simple.”\nHe went on to elucidate the organisation’s track record in similar cases, stating, “We have championed the cause of our members in several analogous situations. In those instances where the cases have reached their conclusion, we have invariably witnessed the public house in question capitulating and offering a formal apology.”\nIt is worth noting that prior to the recent general election, the previous Conservative administration had published guidelines stipulating that educational institutions must refrain from teaching contested gender ideology. However, the current Government has yet to delineate its official stance on this contentious issue.\nIn a recent interview with the BBC conducted in June, Bridget Phillipson, the newly appointed Secretary of State for Education, declined to categorically rule out the possibility of rescinding the aforementioned ban. This ambiguity has only served to further fuel the ongoing debate surrounding the teaching of gender ideology in British schools.\nAs this story continues to unfold, it serves as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance between freedom of expression and the evolving societal norms surrounding gender identity. The incident at The Southern Belle in Brighton has undoubtedly reignited the national conversation on these complex and nuanced issues, leaving many to ponder the future direction of education policy and the boundaries of free speech in contemporary British society.\nThis is yet another example of engineered polarisation of society\nPeople have always conjectured, played detective or drawn their own conclusions based on their personal feelings, and those in control have always sought to control the narrative, but we are now in an age where the ability of those in power to manipulate the masses has never been more sinister than it is today.\nWe have reached an age, where large numbers of people are acting with hostility, in support of the most immoral, destructive and illogical agendas, executed by an infernal minority who are engineering the destruction of society from the shadows.",

South west of the capital and about a 28 km drive out towards the village of Mitsero, you’ll come across the old copper mine of Mitsero, which operated between 1953 and 1966. And once you get to the area, you’ll be taken aback by the ‘acid lake’, seeping up minerals and ore which turn it red. Do not touch the water under any circumstances! But do take as many pictures as you can- it’s a rare site if ever there was one.\nDuring the 1950’s pyrite deposits were found in the area of Kokkinopezoulain . In a period of economic decadence and unemployment a new breath in the area of work was given to the village. The population of Mitsero as well as the surrounding villages stopped seeking work in the town or abroad, while other villagers had moved to Mitsero for work. Even though the working conditions in the mines were exhausting and dangerous, it was a solution for a lot of people who were seeking for work in order to feed their families.\nTheKokkinopezoula Mine stopped operating in 1967. The explosions which were created in order to find the minerals, left many injured while many also lost their lives. At the same time the area had filled with toxic dust that was dangerous for people as well as the environment. Many miners were not able to breathe, walk and many eventually died. The destruction was also dramatic for the environment. The acid and the contamination in the lake and the soil resulted in the fact that the birds and he surrounding trees were not able to survive.\nThe scene around the area of the mine may show remains of devastation, however during the last few years nature has begun to heal its wounds and shows signs of life. Trees have begun to grow around the lake creating greenery. Let’s hope that with time the fauna and flora in the area will be restored completely giving the abandoned and destroyed area a new scenic beauty\nOn April the 14th 2019, two tourists were in the Mitsero mine taking photos, when they discovered a body, Evidence emerges the dead woman is Mary Rose Tiburcio, 39, from the Philippines reported missing by her roommate on May 5, 2018, along with her daughter. Search for Tiburcio’s daughter Sierra, 6, begins.\nThis was the start of a gruesome discovery, that exposed the first serial killer in Cyprus.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_turkey-is-hungry-for-war-with-cyprus/content_707.html": "FOREIGNPOLICY.COM: When Berat Albayrak, Turkey’s finance minister and the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, announced on May 12 that his country would soon send a drill ship to exploit natural gas resources in an area widely considered to belong to Cyprus, it was tempting to write off the incident as just another harmless flare-up in the decadeslong territorial disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. Periodically stoking tensions with Greece and Cyprus has always been a part of Turkish foreign-policy strategy.\nThis time is far more dangerous, however, because there are signs Turkey might be ready to escalate its confrontation beyond mere rhetoric. Albayrak’s announcement came a day before Turkey held Sea Wolf, its largest annual naval exercise in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. Then, on May 15, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated the country’s intention to buy the S-400 missile system from Russia. And throughout this period, Turkish jets have been violating Greek airspace almost daily.\nThe S-400 purchase has been a source of tension on its own. The United States and NATO believe that the missile system, once plugged into Turkey’s radar network, will give Russian systems access to sensitive NATO data—potentially making it easier, for instance, for Moscow to detect the F-35s that Turkey has been looking to procure from the West. Turkey claims those concerns are overblown, but that hasn’t stopped Washington from threatening Ankara with removal from the F-35 purchasing program and further sanctions.\nAll this, again, could be seen simply as part of the generally problematic relationship between Turkey and the West following the events of the Gezi Park protests and the escalation of the war in Syria, when Erdogan began consolidating power at home almost six years ago. But recent local elections in Istanbul—in which Erdogan lost the city he considers his seat of power—have clearly spooked the once unshakeable strongman, causing him to overreach and force a rerun. This looks likely to backfire, with opposition parties withdrawing their candidates and throwing their support behind the Republican People’s Party’s Ekrem Imamoglu, who was the winner of the first round.\nThis comes amid an economy in decline, as reflected in the price of the Turkish lira, and grumbling about Erdogan inside his own party. The frosty reception the president got when he visited Turkey-aligned Northern Cyprus last year also didn’t help his standing at home.\nThese are developments that Erdogan was clearly not ready for. Turks may ultimately benefit from their autocratic president’s sudden weakening. But as far as international politics go, the effects are far more ambiguous. History suggests that leaders who are losing their grip on power have incentives to organize a show of strength and unite their base behind an imminent foreign threat. Erdogan has every reason to create hostilities with Greece—Turkey’s traditional adversary and Cyprus’s ally— to distract from his problems at home.\nThis wouldn’t come out of nowhere. Turkey has never allowed Cyprus to benefit from the natural gas reserves in its waters without some sort of confrontation. In that sense, Turkey’s strategy in the Aegean Sea has been consistent for many decades now: apply pressure, put forth demands, wait for a crisis, and then bring the other side to the table on your own terms. This is precisely what it’s trying to do in Cyprus right now. “What is developing before our eyes is a systematic strategy engineered by Turkey to bring into question the status quo in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean regions,” wrote Alexis Papachelas, one of Greece’s most senior and well-respected journalists, in his column on May 15. “All evidence points to a climax in tensions next autumn.”\nIt’s hard to say what the limits of the current confrontation might be. The present conditions make for a dangerous mix. Erdogan has steadily moved Turkey away from the Western institutions it belongs to (NATO) and the ones it once aspired to be a part of (the European Union) and closer to Russia as he attempts to portray himself as a regional leader in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Cyprus and Greece are both members in good standing of the EU. Indeed, Greece has moved closer to the United States and NATO than it has at any time in the past four decades. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has promoted stronger ties with both Israel and Egypt, Cyprus’s partners in its natural gas ventures.\nErdogan has rarely been so weak at home—or so aggressive with his neighbours in the Mediterranean.\nEurope has an important role to play in deterring a conflict. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has expressed “great concern” over Turkey’s plans. “We call urgently on Turkey to show restraint, respect the sovereign rights of Cyprus in its exclusive economic zone and refrain from any such illegal action to which the EU will respond appropriately and in full solidarity with Cyprus,” she said last week, while in January, French President Emmanuel Macron had said that France supports Cyprus’ right to gas deposits off its coast, despite Turkey’s objections. The EU’s current approach to protecting its borders, however, is unlikely to be enough to deter Erdogan.\nThere are broader geopolitical stakes for Europe. In case of an escalation, including any sort of military conflict, wavering by Cyprus’s and Greece’s allies will invalidate the choices made by the two EU members to strengthen their ties with the West and create further doubt about NATO’s effectiveness.\nNone of this is to suggest that the EU has always handled Turkey and Erdogan as well as it could have, or that Greece, Cyprus, and Israel haven’t made decisions of their own that have raised tensions in the region. But those arguments are not relevant to the present situation. The road map Erdogan is following is of his own creation, as are the seeds of his troubles. In responding to his provocations, Europe must now take a levelheaded but firm approach, one that leaves no room for doubt that Cyprus and Greece have allies on their side. That will do more to dissuade an escalation than any attempt to appease a troubled Erdogan with concessions.\nCOMMENT\nCyprus is one the most vulnerable states in Europe, people live in constant fear of attack from Turkey, which takes pleasure in constantly intimidating a tiny island state. Whatever the reasons for the troubles back in 1974, neither side is completely innocent, but even though Turkey was allowed ti intervene, being one of the three protector states, after six months, that is legally occupation, which has been deemed illegal by international courts, yet nearly 50 years later, they are still there.\nHow did Europe deal with Turkey for its behaviour, both to Cypriots and to surrounding neighbours, who have suffered at their hands? (I won’t get in to that now as I will go off on a tangent) Europe, decided to make Turkey an associate member, this was championed by the recently unified Germany who was bankrupt at the time, allowing them to slowly undercut and steal the light industry from most of Southern Europe. Over the last decade especially, turkey has increasingly hinted at expansion, with many of its politicians calling for a number of Greek islands to be taken. They are also very unhappy with their EEZ which is dwarfed by the area that Greece and Cyprus have.\nUnless something drastic is done to roll back this expansionist ideology, the problem will soon extend beyond Greece and Cyprus, who are unfortunate enough to border this aggressive nation.",

The rage of the masses is quietly boiling over and anyone who dares to ignore that fact will find that this will be a melting pot that will not only catch the political classes by surprise, it will also result in a degree of social unrest not seen for decades.\nThe mere fact that years later, absolutely nothing has been done to address the behaviour of these vile people and the communities that are guilty by association, because they harbour them, is a fact that will come back to haunt them. This is not the usual acts of contempt, by a minority that clearly has not respect for their host nation, this was violence and abuse in its worse form.\nThese animals should never have been given any anonymity, support or protection, they should have been made an example of, so that they could be ostracised on a local and national level, but instead, a handful were threatened with deportation, in a case that was little more than a performance, because for as long as we are part of the ECHR, the political classes know only to well, that the legal system is tied up in knots.\nThere is absolutely no reason for us to be accountable to a court that has no respect for our sovereignty, we are a fair and compassionate society that is not in any way in need of legal and moral supervision, the mere fact that successive politicians of all sides, refuse to take us out of the ECHR, clearly demonstrate the greater agenda and their allegiance to those who really do pull the strings, behind the scenes.\nBe in no doubt, that your silence makes you just as complicit as those vile criminals, who have destroyed hundreds, if not thousands of young girl’s lives.

Gazprom’s Yamal-Europe pipeline, which brings gas from Russia to Germany through Poland and Belarus, saw shipments halted.\nThe development prompted some politicians to assume that Russia is playing politics and pushing for the approval of its recently built Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is yet to be passed by the German regulator. Fully constructed in September, the pipeline has faced vehement opposition from Poland and Ukraine – two transit nations bypassed by the Baltic Sea pipeline, which stand to lose billions of dollars in annual revenues – as well as the US.\nBerlin recently said it would decide the project’s fate on a non-political basis.\nThe Russian gas giant said it simply fulfilled all its existing contractual obligations and did not receive any new supply requests from the relevant European nations, like Germany and France. The company supplied 50.2 billion cubic meters of gas to Germany alone this year, Kupriyanov said, adding that it was 5.3 billion cubic meters more than last year.\nGazprom also fulfilled all its obligations related to gas supplies through the Ukrainian gas transport network as early as on December 15 but still continues to transport gas through Ukraine’s territory.\n“All the problems were created by Western Europe itself,” Kupriyanov said, adding that one should “look in the mirror” instead of “placing the blame on Gazprom.” The spokesman also said that the company is ready to supply additional volumes of gas within the existing contract framework.\nOn Friday, the New York-based financial news media outlet Bloomberg reported that a halt in deliveries was not due to some malicious schemes in Moscow but because of the fact that Gazprom’s western buyers had hit their contractual limits for 2021.\nEurope saw gas prices skyrocketing this autumn, sparking fears of an energy crisis and leading to initial accusations against Moscow. This week, gas prices rose about 20% again, prompting another wave of heated rhetoric from the West.\nCOMMENT:\nWhatever the case, it seems that once again, it is innocent working people who are suffering due to political games by the greater powers. The UK has made itself reliant on imported Gas, by not building enough Nuclear Power Stations, in the 80s & 90s. We had the technology and the capacity to have been totally self-sufficient with clean energy by now, yet previous administrations did not take steps to make this happen, because they were too gutless to push these measures through at the time.\nNow we are hearing contradicting reports, but the fact remains, that many people in the UK and Europe as a whole, cannot afford to keep warm.",

This setback comes as higher interest rates begin to take a toll on demand, as indicated by a closely observed survey. The flash UK composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), a reliable gauge of economic health, dropped to 47.9 in August, down from July’s 50.8 and slipping below the critical 50 threshold for the first time since January. This decline has raised concerns about the nation’s economic trajectory, as experts analyze the implications of this shift.\n**A Sign of Economic Contraction**\nA reading below 50 on the PMI indicates that a majority of businesses are reporting contraction. August’s figure, significantly below the 50.3 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, hints at a potential economic contraction. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which releases the survey, pointed out that a pronounced manufacturing downturn, coupled with the service sector’s waning revival, makes an economic contraction seem inevitable. He projected that the survey results might translate to a 0.2% GDP decline in the third quarter.\n**Interest Rate Impact**\nThe impact of higher interest rates is highlighted as a driving force behind the economic decline. The Bank of England (BoE) has been on a streak of raising interest rates, marking the 15th consecutive increase since December 2021. With the benchmark rate now standing at 5.25%, a 15-year high, economists like Paul Dales from Capital Economics see the data as an affirmation that these higher rates are indeed having an effect. The anticipation of an impending GDP contraction leading to a “mild recession” is gaining ground.\n**Mixed Expert Opinions**\nWhile the figures may not be enough to dissuade the Bank of England from further rate hikes, experts are divided on the future course. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, believes that the current data may not prevent future rate increases, but they might indicate that the next one, if it occurs, could be the final move in the current cycle. This uncertainty is a reflection of the delicate balance that the Bank of England must strike to manage both inflation and economic growth.\n**Sectoral Challenges**\nThe challenges faced by different sectors contribute to the overall economic decline. The services sector, for instance, contracted for the first time since January, with the lowest output reading in 31 months. Simultaneously, the manufacturing sector experienced its sixth consecutive month of falling output. These setbacks are attributed to a mix of factors, including the cost of living crisis, export losses, higher borrowing costs, and general economic uncertainty.\n**Impact on Demand and Prices**\nThe survey pointed to a fall in orders for goods and services, driven by weakened demand amid various economic concerns. While input costs showed slower growth, private sector companies increased their average prices at the slowest rate since February 2021. The impacts of higher interest rates are beginning to reflect in these trends, influencing both demand and the pricing dynamics across sectors.\n**Aiming for a Balanced Approach**\nThe Chief Economist of CIPS, John Glen, noted that higher interest rates are slowly having the intended impact of curbing demand and reducing inflationary pressures. This has led to moderated input costs and lower raw material prices for manufacturers. Striking the right balance between containing inflation and maintaining economic growth remains a key challenge for policymakers.\n**Conclusion**\nThe unexpected decline in the UK’s economic activity in August underscores the impact of higher interest rates on demand. As the flash UK composite PMI fell below the benchmark 50 level for the first time since January, experts are closely watching for signs of economic contraction. The ongoing dance between raising interest rates to control inflation and ensuring economic growth remains a challenge for the Bank of England. As the economic landscape continues to shift, finding this equilibrium will be crucial for the country’s economic future.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-dont-all-new-buildings-have-solar-panels/content_163.html": "Rooftop solar panels are up to 79% cheaper than they were in 2010. These plummeting costs have made rooftop solar photovoltaics even more attractive to households and businesses who want to reduce their reliance on electricity grids while reducing their carbon footprints.\nBut are there enough rooftop surfaces for this technology to generate affordable, low-carbon energy for everyone who needs it? After all, it’s not just people who own their own houses and want to cut their bills who are in need of solutions like this. Around 800 million people globally go without proper access to electricity.\nA new paper in Nature Communications presents a global assessment of how many rooftop solar panels we’d need to generate enough renewable energy for the whole world – and where we’d need to put them. Our study is the first to provide such a detailed map of global rooftop solar potential, assessing rooftop area and sunlight cover at scales all the way from cities to continents.\nIt found that we would only need 50% of the world’s rooftops to be covered with solar panels in order to deliver enough electricity to meet the world’s yearly needs.\nMethod\nThe researchers designed a programme that incorporated data from over 300 million buildings and analysed 130 million km² of land – almost the entire land surface area of the planet. This estimated how much energy could be produced from the 0.2 million km² of rooftops present on that land, an area roughly the same size as the UK.\nThey then calculated electricity generation potentials from these rooftops by looking at their location. Generally, rooftops located in higher latitudes such as in northern Europe or Canada can vary by as much as 40% in their generation potential across the year, due to big differences in sunshine between winter and summer. Rooftops near the equator, however, usually only vary in generation potential by around 1% across the seasons, as sunshine is much more consistent.\nThis is important because these large variations in monthly potential can have a significant impact on the reliability of solar-powered electricity in that region. That means places where sunlight is more irregular require energy storage solutions – increasing electricity costs.\nHotspots\nThe results highlighted three potential hotspots for rooftop solar energy generation: Asia, Europe and North America.\nOf these, Asia looks like the cheapest location to install panels, where – in countries like India and China – one kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity, or approximately 48 hours of using your laptop, can be produced for just 0.05p. This is thanks to cheap panel manufacturing costs, as well as sunnier climates.\nMeanwhile, the costliest countries for implementing rooftop solar are USA, Japan and the UK. Europe holds the middle ground, with average costs across the continent of around 0.096p per kWh.\nRooftop solar panels look like they’d be equally useful in areas with low population as they would be in urban centres. For those living in remote areas, panels help top up or even replace supply from potentially unreliable local grids. And for those in cities, panels can significantly reduce air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels for energy.\nIt’s vital to point out that global electricity supply cannot rely on a single source of generation to meet the requirements of billions of people. And, thanks to changeable weather and our planet’s day and night cycle, a mismatch between solar energy demand and supply is unavoidable.\nThe equipment required to store solar power for when it’s needed is still extremely expensive. Additionally, solar panels won’t be able to deliver enough power for some industries. Heavy manufacturing and metal processing, for example, require very large currents and specialised electricity delivery, which solar power won’t yet be able to provide.\nDespite this, rooftop solar has huge potential to alleviate energy poverty and put clean, pollution-free power back in the hands of consumers worldwide. If the costs of solar power continue to decrease, rooftop panels could be one of the best tools yet to decarbonise our electricity supply.\nIt is actually disgraceful that legislation has not already been put in to place, for all new buildings to have solar powered roofs. Tesla actually produce Solar Roof Tiles, that look just like ordinary tiles and will fit in with existing buildings.\nThe Rolls Royce small modular reactors can easily power a large city, that would be a better way to go.\nThe Rolls Royce small modular reactors can easily power a large city, that would be a better way to go.",

The spate of killings includes the shocking murder of a 13-year-old boy who was shot in the head in a Stockholm suburb.\nShocking spate of killings\nIn just the last 12 hours, three more people have been brutally killed. An 18-year-old rapper was shot dead during a football training session at a sports ground in Stockholm. Later that evening, one man was killed and another injured in a shooting in a suburb south of the capital.\nAnd in the early hours of this morning, a devastating bomb blast ripped through an apartment block just outside Uppsala, north of Stockholm. A 25-year-old woman was killed when her home was destroyed in the explosion. Four neighboring buildings were also badly damaged in what looked like a “war zone,” according to witnesses.\nThe woman is believed to have been an innocent victim, with the intended target her neighbor who has links to notorious gang leader Rawa Majid, known as the “Kurdish Fox.”\nLast week also saw a gunman open fire in a crowded bar in Sandviken, killing two people. And the 13-year-old boy, identified only as Milo, was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head near his home in Haninge, south of Stockholm.\nPM vows to “hunt down the gangs”\nIn a televised address last night, Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson vowed to “hunt down the gangs” and “defeat” them.\nHe said Sweden has “never seen anything like this” and that “no other country in Europe is seeing anything like this.”\nMr Kristersson is meeting with the head of the armed forces and national chief of police today to discuss deploying the military to support police in tackling gang violence.\nSweden is considering calling in soldiers to bolster law enforcement, which is struggling to cope with the surge in gang warfare and organized crime. However, it’s not yet clear exactly how the military could get involved.\nGang violence fuelled by feud\nMuch of the violence has been fuelled by a bloody feud between two rival gang leaders vying for control of the illegal drugs and arms trade.\nRawa Majid, who lives in Turkey, has been fighting a turf war against his former associate Ismail Abdo, known as “The Strawberry.” Abdo’s mother, in her 60s, was shot earlier this month in an incident believed to be related to the feud, and later died from her injuries.\nThese criminal networks are fighting violent vendettas and becoming increasingly brazen in targeting each other in public shootings, grenade attacks and bombings. Sweden has seen a rise in drive-by assassinations, often carried out on suburban streets in broad daylight.\nChildren caught up in “extreme violence”\nShockingly, children are also being caught up in the brutal gang warfare. Apart from the 13-year-old boy murdered this month, prosecutors say teenagers are being manipulated into storing firearms for adult criminals.\nPM Kristersson said an “increasing number of children and completely innocent people are affected by this extreme violence.”\nThe usually tranquil Scandinavian nation is struggling to contain this rapid spiral into gang lawlessness. Sweden registered over 390 shootings last year, with over 60 fatal.\nNew crackdown on gangs\nIn response, Kristersson has unveiled a raft of tough new measures to clamp down on the gangs.\nHe said “Swedish legislation was not designed for gang wars and child soldiers” but that is now changing. New laws will enable increased surveillance such as wiretapping gang members’ communications.\nPolice will get more powers to conduct body searches in certain areas. Sentences for gang-related gun crime and repeat offenders will be significantly increased. Teenage criminals could also face being held in new dedicated youth prisons.\nKristersson promised that gang members who are foreign nationals will be deported, even if they have not committed a crime themselves but simply have gang associations.\nCritics blame previous government’s policies\nThe conservative Prime Minister blamed the rise in gang crime on what he called the “naivete” of previous governments.\nHe said their liberal immigration policies and failure to integrate migrants had allowed the gang violence to spiral out of control over the past decade.\nCritics argue the former Social Democrat government failed to invest enough in policing and social programs in disadvantaged immigrant neighborhoods. This provided fertile ground for organized crime networks to flourish among disenfranchised youths.\nThere are also calls for more focus on addressing root causes of gang culture rather than relying predominantly on punitive measures. But the government insists getting tougher on crime is crucial to restoring law and order.\nEmergency steps to quell gang warfare\n– Sweden is experiencing a historic surge in gang violence, with 12 killed this month alone in shootings and bombings.\n– The prime minister has called crisis talks with military and police chiefs to discuss deploying troops to help tackle the crisis.\n– Much of the violence stems from a feud between two rival gang leaders fighting for control of the criminal underworld.\n– Children are being drawn into the brutal gang conflict, with a 13-year-old boy shockingly murdered this month.\n– The PM has vowed to “hunt down the gangs” and unveiled tough new measures including increased surveillance and deportation of foreign criminals.\n– Critics argue the previous government’s policies failed to integrate immigrants and invest in disadvantaged areas, enabling gangs to thrive.\n– With the military possibly taking on a policing role, Sweden faces a decisive moment in confronting the unprecedented gang violence threatening society.\n– The coming months will test whether the government’s hardline approach can stem the bloodshed and defeat the power of criminal networks.\nAs gang-related deaths continue to mount, the government is taking emergency steps to quash the blooshed. Kristersson said “We are going to defeat the gangs,” vowing to stop the violence “spreading like a toxin in our society.”\nWith the military poised to potentially take a frontline role in combating gang criminality, Sweden faces an uncertain future.

Currently it takes 45 minutes by car to go to the capital but with a crossing point, it would only take 10 minutes.\n“If this happens, Athienou will be revitalised,” said Kareklas. “Within 10 minutes residents will have access to the university, the hospital and other areas of the capital instead of the 45 minutes that is needed today with the dense traffic at the entrance to Nicosia.”\nIt is time to open borders throughout Cyprus!\nHe said Garber acknowledged the problem and promised she would do whatever was within her capabilities to help.\nThe mayor asked her to discuss it with the ambassadors of the four other countries, Russia, France, the UK and China, that make up the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Kareklas also asked Garber to raise the issue with the UN Special Representative in Cyprus, Elizabeth Spehar. He himself had had meetings with the ambassadors of Russia, France and the UK, he added.\nKareklas also handed Garber a letter, a copy of which he sent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York asking that the village be allowed to make 3D copies of artefacts stolen from the area and donated to the museum by the US Consul Luigi Palma di Cesnola during his tenure in Cyprus between 1865 and 1877.\nAlthough the [Metropolitan] Museum is private and does not belong to the government, the US ambassador promised to do everything she could to meet our request,” said Kareklas.\nGarber, in her statements following her visit to the archaeological site, said the collaboration between the American students and the municipality of Athienou “is fantastic since they work together to bring to light the rich history of Cyprus”.\n“The area is impressive and we were able to see some of the findings come to light, while new items are being found there daily,” she added.\nThe Malloura-Athienou excavations are led by Davidson College Professor of Archaeology, Michael Toumazou, originally from Athienou, who briefed the visitors. Malloura was occupied from the Geometric through Ottoman periods, ca. 8th century BC to the 19th century AD.\nCOMMENT\nIt is time to push for more crossings, the crossing at Athienou, via Piroi would be a monumental step forward, as the isolated village of Athienou, which has a half Moon border around it, would no longer be cut off from Nicosia, which is in fact only 8 miles away, but currently it is over 20, due to the detour.\nWe need to be aiming to create as many opportunities as possible for people to meet and stop living behind a border. Most people have had enough, they want to be able to live, to travel around the whole island unhindered and without restriction. In terms of moving forward, this is a very important and necessary step. We need only look at Ledra street, not long ago it was little more than run down back streets, yet now it is the life and soul of Nicosia.\nIt’s time to look forward.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_david-cameron-says-uk-should-be-closer-with-eu/content_170.html": "David Cameron says UK should be closer with EU\nThe Brexit Debate Rages On: Assessing David Cameron’s Call for Closer UK-EU Ties\nIntroduction\nFormer British Prime Minister David Cameron has sparked fresh controversy over Brexit by arguing that the UK should seek closer ties with the EU on foreign policy and defence. In an exclusive newspaper interview, Cameron said that Britain needs to work more closely with Brussels and described the EU bloc as a “friend, neighbour and partner”.\nHis comments have provoked a fierce backlash from pro-Brexit Conservatives who warn that he risks reigniting bitter divisions over the UK’s decision to leave the EU. With new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak struggling to unite his party, does Cameron’s intervention demonstrate a lack of political judgement or refreshing pragmatism over future UK-EU relations?\nCameron’s Case for Cooperation\nAs the Conservative Prime Minister who called the 2016 Brexit referendum and campaigned for Remain, David Cameron has seen his reputation badly damaged by the vote to leave. While stopping short of calling for the UK to rejoin the EU, his plea for closer cooperation suggests a desire to rehabilitate his standing on the international stage.\nSpecifically, Cameron argues that Britain should align more closely with Brussels on security and defence policy. This reflects a belief that shared European interests in areas like Ukraine make pragmatic cooperation vital regardless of membership status. Implicit within this is a hope that improved relations could also ease disputes over issues like the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nSceptics Dismiss Cameron’s ‘Gravy Train’ Mentality\nFor ardent Brexiteers like former Brexit Party politician Belinda de Lucy, however, Cameron’s comments smack of an anti-democratic and self-serving mentality. De Lucy argues that while the former PM claims greater cooperation is needed, his real motivation is to repair relations with his pro-EU friends and secure global acclaim.\nSimilarly, de Lucy cautions that the EU will exploit any openings to gradually erode British sovereignty and democratic consent. From her perspective, the UK must maintain clear red lines on involvement with EU structures to prevent a gradual drift back into the bloc. This demonstrates how underlying distrust of EU motives continues to influence certain Conservatives.\nWhat Do Cameron’s Comments Mean for the Conservatives?\nCameron’s call for alignment also has significant implications for the embattled Conservative government led by Rishi Sunak. Sunak has already provoked Tory unease for appointing ardent Remainer Greg Hands as Trade Secretary. The emergence of Cameron’s pro-EU views compounds a fear among Brexiteers that the government plans to edge closer to Brussels over time.\nAs political commentator Matthew Stadlen notes, this risks further inflaming divisions within Conservative ranks. Hardline Leavers will blast Cameron’s comments as proof that senior Tories still harbour hopes of eventual EU reintegration. With the Conservatives trailing heavily in the polls, reopening the Brexit divide seems politically reckless and unlikely to tempt back voters who defected over the issue.\nThe Brexit Legacy\nWhile a thought-provoking intervention, Cameron’s call for closer ties looks destined to further alienate Leavers rather than build bridges. It speaks to the immense challenge facing Conservative leaders in reconciling the two warring EU factions within their ranks. Until they can finally settle the Brexit question, votes will continue bleeding to rival parties.\nThe heated responses also highlight that the scars from the polarising 2016 campaign remain raw for many,colouring how Cameron’s motives are perceived. Rightly or wrongly, he failed the test set for him by millions of Leave supporters and risks being forever seen by them as the PM who refused to implement their democratic will.\nConclusion\n• Former British PM David Cameron has controversially argued that the UK should seek closer ties with the EU on foreign policy and defence matters.\n• Cameron says Britain needs to cooperate more with Brussels and has described the EU as a “friend, neighbour and partner”.\n• His comments have sparked fury among pro-Brexit Conservatives who warn he risks reigniting bitter divisions.\n• Cameron likely wants to rehabilitate his reputation after being damaged by Brexit vote.\n• He specifically argues for alignment on security and defence policy due to shared European interests.\n• Ardent Brexiteer Belinda de Lucy cautions EU will exploit openings to erode British sovereignty over time.\n• De Lucy says Cameron is motivated by desire to please pro-EU friends and secure personal international acclaim.\n• Cameron’s call risks inflaming tensions within the divided Conservative Party led by Rishi Sunak.\n• Reopening Brexit rifts seems politically hazardous with Conservatives trailing heavily in polls.\n• Cameron’s plea for cooperation faces being ignored as trust in EU severely depleted among Brexiteers.\n• Until Conservatives resolve Brexit divides, they will keep losing votes to rival parties.\n• For many Leavers, Cameron failed test posed by Brexit vote and can’t be redeemed.\n• Cameron’s EU vision seems destined to widen Tory splits rather than healing Brexit rifts.\nDavid Cameron’s desire for renewed UK-EU cooperation holds some logic but looks a forlorn hope given current Tory divisions. With trust in Brussels so depleted among Leavers, pragmatic alignment seems unlikely barring a change in government. For now at least, both camps appear destined to continue staring across an unbridgeable Brexit divide.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-migrant-crisis-is-a-threat-to-eu/content_964.html": "The migrant crisis is a threat to EU\nThe Mediterranean Migrant Crisis: A Looming Threat to the Future of the EU\nIntroduction\nAs the Mediterranean migrant crisis continues to escalate, the European Union faces a daunting challenge that threatens to undermine its very existence. Keir Starmer’s plan to strike a deal with the EU regarding asylum-seekers from other European countries, in exchange for those arriving in Britain via small boats, has exposed a glaring flaw in the EU’s asylum system. How can the EU negotiate with the UK when it struggles to manage the issue of migrants among its own member states? In this article, we delve into the complexities of the Mediterranean migrant crisis and its potential to erode the unity of the European Union.\nThe Ideal Asylum System\nStarmer’s proposal mirrors how Europe’s asylum system should ideally function. Asylum-seekers should be required to file their claims in the first safe country they reach. Those who move between safe countries should be promptly returned to the first safe nation they entered or sent back home. Furthermore, the burden of processing asylum applications should be distributed equitably among EU member states.\nEU’s Faltering Asylum System\nHowever, the EU has failed to establish an effective asylum system, leading to dire consequences. A glaring example is the recent influx of 7,000 migrants on the Italian island of Lampedusa in just two days, outnumbering the island’s permanent population of 6,000. Italy is left to grapple with this crisis largely on its own, having dealt with 124,000 arrivals in 2023 so far.\nWhile the EU introduced a voluntary resettlement scheme for asylum applications in 2015, many member states have chosen not to participate. In 2022, Cyprus faced a staggering 22,190 asylum applications, equivalent to 24,119 for every million inhabitants, while Hungary, excluding refugees from Ukraine, managed a mere 45 applications, or 4.7 for every million inhabitants. Hungary has also fortified its borders with a Trump-style fence to deter migrants traveling from Greece to Germany.\nEven countries that previously supported a fair share approach are wavering. Germany, with 243,835 asylum applications in 2022 (2,892 for every million inhabitants), suspended its agreement to accept asylum seekers from Italy, and Belgium intends to ignore a ruling by its supreme court regarding shelter for single young male asylum-seekers.\nEU’s Sovereignty Challenges\nThe principle of free movement, a cornerstone of the EU, seems to crumble when it comes to asylum applicants. Member states readily deploy barriers, such as Hungary’s border fence, to keep migrants out. This stark contrast to the EU’s stance on free movement, as seen during David Cameron’s pre-referendum negotiations, is disconcerting.\nA Potential EU Breakdown\nIf the EU cannot find consensus on how to address the migrant crisis, it risks rendering itself irrelevant. As formerly migrant-friendly countries like Germany and Sweden distance themselves from those arriving on Europe’s southern shores, a “every country for itself” mentality may prevail. This would undoubtedly provoke strong reactions from nations significantly affected by migrant flows.\nConclusion\nOver a decade ago, the EU weathered the sovereign debt crisis, but the Mediterranean migrant crisis poses an even greater threat to its stability. The lofty ideals that underpin the EU are being severely tested, and the bloc’s structural integrity may be found wanting. As the Mediterranean migrant crisis continues to escalate, it becomes increasingly crucial for the EU to address this issue collectively and with determination to ensure the unity and future of the European Union.",

Didn’t Margaret Thatcher lie, when she campaigned to take us in to the ‘Common Market’ she admitted years later, that she could not tell us what the real agenda was, because the British public, would not agree!\nShe lied and contributed to us entering in to an unelected, unaccountable club, with the agenda of ‘ever closer union’\nAll the rest of her little battles, were little more than window dressing, an issue that divided an entire nation.\nDid Callaghan not lie? John Major? He signed us up to the Maastricht treaty, further tightening the EU noose around our necks, he denied it at the time, but since leaving office, he has revealed his Globalist support.\nDid Tony Blair lie, when he started a war in Iraq, in his search for the elusive ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction’ which on reflection, can be seen as the start of the great migration onslaught that threatens our very society.\nWho agreed the UN compact on immigration? A worldwide agreement for ‘sustained immigration’ which actually means that we are now facing continued and increasing immigration.\nDo they not lie to us when they give us the figures of the immigrants? They only count the head of the family, so 10 immigrants, could actually be 20, or 30, or 40+\nWhat did Boris actually do? He resisted from actually stating..\n“My wife Carrie arranged a surprise cake for me and invited one of her friends”\nWho would have done that?\nAs for Pincher, what would have happened, if he were actually Gay & Black? Would have any Prime Minister even dared to refuse him/her a position, because of an allegation? No!!!\nBoris has delivered on everything he promised, to the best of his ability. He did not want tax hikes, he did not want to lock us down, refusing to grasp the opportunity to use Covid as cover, to implement a ‘Police state by stealth’\nThat’s rather different to the bitter, toxic First Minister of Scotland has done, as have certain other countries.\nThe media which is predominantly left, were always going to smear Boris, why?\nBecause without Boris, the odds of a Labour Government have just increased.\nSo here we are ladies & gentlemen, (yes, there are only the two) we are now faced with choosing between a Snake, or the most boring speaker since my Woodwork teacher. In fact, I feel that Liz Truss should be preceded by a warning before she speaks in public…\n“Do not operate heavy machinery whilst listening to this woman!”\nBoris remained neutral over the last few weeks, he continued to execute his role to the best of his ability and I am in total agreement with him, he leaves with his head held high. Meanwhile, the Conservative party have their heads in their hands, for they know that they have committed political treason, removing the greatest asset since Margaret Thatcher………..who also lied!\n“Hasta la vista, baby!”\nBoris leaves a legacy of a true statesman.\nCompletely agree! This is not democracy, we voted for Boris, we did not want him removed, simply because he eat a piece of a cake, this is ridiculous.\nIt beggars belief!\nSo true! These people removed Boris without the mandate of the people, then they are able to back whoever they wish, for their own reasons, even if they are voting tactically, with complete anonymity.\nNo matter what happens, we will not have a leader anywhere near the calibre of Boris, that was not by our choice………Disgraceful.\nWe have a right to know who they voted for, they do not deserve the privilege of anonymity.\nWatching the last PMQs yesterday was almost poetic justice.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-high-cost-of-proving-innocence/content_248.html": "The High Cost of Proving Innocence\nThe High Cost of Proving Innocence: One Man’s Story of Fighting a Wrongful Conviction\nIntroduction\nEach year in England and Wales, thousands find themselves trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare – accused and convicted of crimes they did not commit. Even if acquitted, these innocent people face financial ruin and emotional devastation just to prove their innocence.\nBrian Buckle knows this traumatic ordeal first-hand. Wrongfully imprisoned for child sex abuse, he spent over 5 years fighting to clear his name. The steep cost: over £500,000 and the emotional wreckage of a life derailed.\nBrian’s story highlights the urgent need for reform. The current system often fails those wrongly accused who deserve justice. Without support, the innocent may plead guilty or serve sentences for crimes they didn’t commit. The financial and emotional tolls can irrevocably damage lives and families.\nDescending Into a Nightmare\nIn 2017, Brian Buckle’s life imploded when he was accused of historical child sex abuse. Though maintaining his innocence, a jury convicted Brian of 16 counts, sending the stunned father to prison for 15 years.\nBrian recalls the nightmarish first night in his cell, crying uncontrollably. In prison, he lived alongside real sex offenders while his name and reputation sank into ignominy outside the walls.\nBrian’s bewildered family refused to accept the guilty verdict. His steadfast wife Elaine resolved to do whatever necessary to prove his innocence. She recognised the uphill battle facing them. “You’re guilty until you can prove you’re innocent, and it’s you who has to do the work,” she laments.\nWithout financial assistance, Brian’s middle-class status ironically worked against him. His household income disqualified him from legal aid. The government only provides legal aid to the poorest defendants who pass an income threshold – currently just £37,500 per year for families like the Buckles.\nThis gaping hole in the system forces many acquitted defendants into bankruptcy from legal costs. With no choice but to shoulder the financial burden, Brian’s family scrambled to begin the arduous process of overturning his conviction.\nAll-Consuming Fight for Freedom\nFrom their Welsh home, Brian’s family spearheaded the campaign to free him. Wife Elaine, mother Jackie, aunt Daphne and daughter Georgia exhaustively researched his case, poring over transcripts, consulting experts and hiring private investigators.\nThey turned their home into appeal headquarters, devotionally working long hours fueled by a visceral need to exonerate Brian. “I don’t care what we do, how much it costs, we have got to prove his innocence,” Elaine insisted.\nThe Buckles cobbled together over £500,000 to fund Brian’s defense, draining their accounts, borrowing from relatives and spending inheritance money. Their case even captured the attention of former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques, who believes police sometimes rush to charge suspects without thoroughly investigating.\nSuch intense focus on getting a conviction can leave the accused vulnerable, regardless of innocence. The Buckles recognized Brian’s helplessness within a system that offered little support despite his wrongful imprisonment.\nDNA Evidence Opens the Cell Door\nThe tedious hours finally brought a major breakthrough when new DNA analysis invalidated the original conviction. Brian’s barrister succeeded in winning an appeal hearing by convincing the judges the DNA could have been planted.\nStunned in his prison video suite, Brian struggled to follow the convoluted legal arguments. Suddenly the clerk notified him the judges unanimously quashed his convictions citing the DNA evidence. Brian shook with joy, scarcely believing he would walk free after years of torment.\nBut the celebration proved premature. Despite the DNA revelations, prosecutors inexplicably demanded a retrial. Brian’s living nightmare dragged on, justice still out of reach.\nThankfully during the retrial, Brian’s fortified legal team presented irrefutable forensic evidence discrediting the prosecution’s case. After brief deliberation, the jury decisively acquitted Brian on all counts.\nOver five years after his conviction, Brian finally left prison vindicated yet battered, not fully grasping his profound loss.\nPick Up the Pieces of a Shattered Life\nClearing his name came at an unconscionably steep price. Brian estimates total costs over £500,000 between legal fees, experts, private investigators and lost income. The Buckles’ life savings evaporated paying for his defense.\nBrian lost his construction management job and pension. He missed his daughter’s 18th and 21st birthdays, her first driving lesson – precious milestones gone forever. His father passed away, the strain of Brian’s conviction likely contributing to his death.\nBrian remains haunted with post-traumatic stress from prison. He developed obsessive behaviors like repeatedly cleaning the house. “I’m not the old Brian Buckle,” he laments. His wife Elaine agrees the experience irrevocably changed him.\nYet Brian shudders to think of still languishing in prison were it not for his family’s support. He feels the system abandoned him to prove his own innocence. Without financial means, the wrongfully convicted may submit to injustice, their lives destroyed for lack of a proper defense.\nSeeking Justice: Brian’s Story is Far Too Common\nBrian Buckle’s harrowing experience reveals systematic failures. Thousands each year face financial catastrophe defending themselves against wrongful convictions.\nCampaigners warn innocent defendants suffer an “innocence tax”, forced to pay crippling legal costs when the state should provide support. £37,500 is inadequate for legal aid in today’s economy, leaving many in limbo. This financial burden falls heaviest on middle-income families who lose savings fighting for justice.\nBrian Buckle’s story highlights the urgent need for reform. The wrongly accused deserve robust support to prove their innocence. The government must strengthen legal aid and provide recourse for financial losses sustained under a flawed system. Only then can citizens like Brian Buckle clear their names without incurring unfair penalties.\nTrue justice requires protecting the innocent against wrongful convictions. Brian Buckle’s courage in sharing his experience sheds light on changes needed to uphold justice for all citizens, regardless of means. The cost of innocence should never spell financial ruin.",

This is the result of investigating the complaints of Themis Thomas and Associates, which are listed in a three-letter letter to the municipalities and communities adjacent to the airport and within the limits of which the commercial activities of this kind are being developed.\nOnly the four private car parks, out of more than 18, which operate in total for the service of Larnaca Airport travelers, appear to be licensed.\nMr. Thomas, whom POLITIS spoke to, represents some of the licensed businesses of the kind and, as he said, only four of these sites operate with the required licenses. As we confirmed in conversation with the municipal authorities, the two legal parking spaces are operating in Larnaka Municipality and the other two in the Municipality of Dromolaxia-Meneu. In Dromolaxia-Meneu there is a licensing process and a third parking space, which has been operating illegally. All licensed developments have town planning permission by derogation. In the Municipality of Aradippou, as the mayor has confirmed, no such license has been issued nor has it been found to operate illegally a parking space that would serve air travellers during their short absence abroad.\nIn the Municipality of Aradippou, as the mayor has confirmed, no such license has been issued\nMayor Kiti said there was no approved-licensed parking, nor did he say he is aware of an illegal operation and referred us to the provincial administration, which grants the building permits. From the office of the Larnaca District Office we learned that no such permission for such a parking space has been issued, so if such spaces are operating in the community boundaries of the Larnaca Village or Tersefanou, in the nearest villages of the airport, they will not be licensed. Hermes Airports, as the POLITIS knows, does not know the status of these companies.

The letter is also addressed to the Commission for the Protection of Competition for a complaint about unfair competition between legal and unlawful enterprises whereby the former invest and have all the required specifications and the second ones are speculating without having any obligation. Thomas explains that unlicensed parking facilities pick up the private cars of unsuspecting citizens after telephone conversation and then carry them to their allegedly approved parking areas, which are “other than observed spaces or areas belonging to unsuspecting citizens and exploited by third parties. Please note, “Thomas said in the same letter,” that there have been several incidents of damage, theft, but also misuse of property. ” Please note that businesses offering this service, whether they are picking up airport travelers or their customers, leave them at their premises and transfer them to the airport. They also offer other services such as car washing. whether they are picking up airport travelers or leaving their customers at their premises and transporting them to the airport.

As he explains, “no security is provided to private cars transported to these car parks, but at the same time remains security of the airport. As he explains, “perimeter of the fenced parking area of Larnaca Airport has become an intervention by unauthorized parking garages, creating large openings in order to be able to penetrate undisturbed and carry out their illegal activity. The site remains exposed by giving access to anyone. ” From time to time, he notes, his clients made complaints, but without the bosses to bother to answer.\nReferring to a specific incident, Mr. Thomas notes that a car was fired in a non-licensed parking area across from Larnaca Airport. “Initially, the fire started off a vehicle without knowing the real reason, since all the illegal sites did not respond to the security measures they should have, such as providing security systems, monitoring, etc. Then the fire was transported to adjacent vehicles, resulting in the total destruction of five “. This parking area is also close to a fuel storage area, he points out.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_eus-embarrassing-climbdown-falklands-sovereignty-confirmed-as-british/content_272.html": "EU’s Embarrassing Climbdown: Falklands’ Sovereignty Confirmed as British\nIntroduction:\nIn a recent turn of events, the European Union found itself in an embarrassing climbdown after mistakenly referring to the Falkland Islands as the ‘Islas Malvinas’ and suggesting that the sovereignty of the islands was disputed. This diplomatic misstep sparked immediate criticism from Downing Street and war veterans, leading to a swift clarification from EU officials. Let’s delve into the details of this incident, the implications it carries, and the resounding victory for the Falkland Islanders in asserting their right to self-determination.\nThe EU’s Controversial Remarks:\nThe contentious remarks by the European Union came to light following talks in Brussels with Latin American and Caribbean political leaders. In an official communique released after the EU-CELAC heads of state conference, the EU referred to the Falkland Islands as the ‘Islas Malvinas,’ aligning with Argentina’s longstanding claim over the territory. The statement further called for a ‘peaceful solution of disputes’ surrounding the islands’ sovereignty, causing an uproar among those supporting the British claim.\nRebuke from Downing Street and War Veterans:\nThe remarks from the EU drew sharp criticism from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his official spokesperson. They called it a ‘regrettable choice of words’ and emphasized that the Falkland Islands are unequivocally British. They reiterated that the islanders themselves had chosen this status, and the EU’s position on the matter had not changed. The UK government vowed to continue defending the Falklands’ right to self-determination in international forums and urged the EU to respect the democratic rights of the Falkland Islanders.\nEU’s U-Turn and Clarification:\nFollowing widespread backlash, EU officials issued a clarification, emphasizing that the member states’ views and positions regarding the Falklands/Islas Malvinas had not changed. They asserted that the EU was not in a position to express any official stance on the matter, as there was no council discussion on the issue. This clarification was a crucial victory for the Falkland Islanders, reaffirming the international recognition of their status as a British overseas territory.\nImplications of the Incident:\nThe incident raises concerns about the EU’s handling of delicate geopolitical matters and its potential impact on diplomatic relations with the UK and other nations. Given that the Falkland Islands are no longer an overseas territory of an EU member state after Brexit, the EU’s misstep is seen as a provocative move by some, aimed at undermining the UK’s sovereignty.\nSupport for the Falkland Islands’ Status:\nThe people of the Falkland Islands have demonstrated their overwhelming support for remaining a part of the UK family. In a referendum ten years ago, 99.8% of the islanders voted to maintain their status as a British territory. Furthermore, the UN Charter recognizes their right to self-determination, and the EU’s own 2009 Lisbon Treaty acknowledges the islanders’ right to determine their future. The EU’s initial remarks thus stood in stark contrast to these established principles.\nConclusion:\nIn the wake of the EU’s embarrassing climbdown over the Falkland Islands, it is evident that the international community stands united in recognizing the islanders’ right to self-determination. The swift response from Downing Street and war veterans, coupled with the subsequent clarification from EU officials, highlights the importance of respecting the democratic rights of nations and territories worldwide. The Falkland Islanders can rest assured that their voice has been heard and their status as a British overseas territory remains firmly acknowledged on the international stage.\nComment:\nThis is an insult to the United Kingdom, but even more so, to the gallant soldiers who fought and won, against the odds, back in 1982. I believe that the EU owes them an apology for this pre-meditated act against out nation, which is one of a long list of despicable actions that this arrogant, unaccountable and malicious organisation is responsible for.",

The 63-year-old broadcaster, once a familiar and trusted face on televisions across the nation, was handed a six-month suspended jail term, prompting widespread criticism and claims of a deeply flawed justice system.\nThe case has ignited a fierce debate about the apparent disparity in sentencing between offences involving child exploitation and those related to controversial social media posts. Critics argue that this verdict sends a troubling message about the perceived gravity of crimes against children in comparison to online misdemeanours.\nEdwards pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children, a charge that typically carries the potential for immediate imprisonment. Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard the disturbing details of how the disgraced journalist had engaged in highly inappropriate communications with Alex Williams, a convicted paedophile.\nThe court was told that Edwards had transferred £1,500 to Williams after receiving 41 indecent images of children via the popular messaging application WhatsApp. In a particularly chilling revelation, it emerged that when asked if he desired “naughty pics and vids” of someone described as “young”, Edwards had responded with the encouraging phrase “go on”.\nThe prosecution detailed that the majority of the illicit images viewed by Edwards depicted children between the ages of 13 and 15. However, in a shocking escalation, one video sent to the former BBC star featured the abuse of a child estimated to be between just seven and nine years old.\nDespite the severity of these offences, Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring opted for a suspended sentence. Edwards was given a six-month jail term, suspended for two years, meaning he will avoid immediate imprisonment unless he reoffends during this period. Additionally, he was ordered to complete 25 rehabilitation sessions and participate in a sex offender treatment programme for 40 days. The court also imposed a fine of £3,000 in prosecution costs and mandated that Edwards be placed on the sex offenders’ register for a duration of seven years.\nThe sentencing has provoked a strong reaction from various sectors of society, with many expressing disbelief and anger at what they perceive as undue leniency.\nSir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, expressed his shock and dismay at the case, stating he was “appalled” by Edwards’ crimes. However, he refrained from commenting directly on the sentence, noting that it was a matter for the courts to decide.\nThe BBC, Edwards’ long-time employer, issued a statement distancing itself from its former star presenter. A spokesperson for the corporation said: “We are appalled by his crimes. He has betrayed not just the BBC, but audiences who put their trust in him.” This sentiment echoes the feeling of betrayal experienced by many who had welcomed Edwards into their homes through their television screens for decades.\nMiriam Cates, a former Conservative MP and vocal online campaigner, suggested that the verdict exemplified a troubling two-tier system operating within the courts. She argued, “As we have seen in recent weeks, courts are not afraid in principle to issue custodial sentences for online crimes. But the creation and sharing of child sexual abuse material is still seen too often as a ‘victimless crime’.”\nNigel Farage, the outspoken leader of Reform UK, didn’t mince words in his criticism of the verdict. Speaking to The Telegraph, he stated, “This is not a good look for our criminal justice system when we have recently seen offenders get custodial sentences for unpleasant things said on social media. It is no wonder the public have lost faith in our institutions. Something doesn’t feel right.”\nAdding his voice to the chorus of disapproval, Brendan Clarke-Smith, who previously served as a children’s minister, emphasised the potential ramifications of such a high-profile case resulting in a non-custodial sentence. He expressed concern that it “sends out completely the wrong message to other offenders” and suggested that a review of sentencing guidelines might be necessary.\nThe Edwards case has inevitably drawn comparisons with recent instances where individuals have received custodial sentences for offences related to social media posts. This juxtaposition has fuelled the argument that there exists an imbalance in how different types of offences are treated by the justice system.\nOne such example is the case of Lee Dunn, a 51-year-old man who was sentenced to eight weeks in prison in August for the offence of sending a grossly offensive message. Dunn had pleaded guilty to posting offensive images about Muslims on Facebook, despite promptly deleting them and issuing an apology when he realised his mistake.\nAnother case that has been brought into the spotlight is that of Julie Sweeney, who received a 15-month custodial sentence for writing a Facebook post calling for a mosque to be blown up. Her husband, David Sweeney, expressed his outrage at the Edwards verdict, describing it as “appalling” and calling for a comprehensive overhaul of the justice system.\nToby Young, director of the Free Speech Union, highlighted this perceived inconsistency, stating, “Last month, a man was jailed for re-posting three offensive images about Muslims on Facebook, even though he deleted them shortly afterwards and apologised. Yet Huw Edwards, who pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children, has been given a suspended sentence. It’s hard not to conclude we have a two-tier criminal justice system in which Islamophobia is punished more severely than paedophilia.”\nChild protection advocates have expressed particular concern about the message this sentence sends regarding the seriousness of offences involving the exploitation of minors.\nSusie Hargreaves, an online safety consultant and former chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, which is dedicated to removing child abuse images from the internet, voiced her disappointment with the verdict. She emphasised that accessing indecent images of children is far from a victimless crime, stating, “As someone who has seen lots of category A images and seen the devastating impact on those children, which they carry their whole lives, I think you need to send out stronger messages on this.”\nHargreaves acknowledged the complexity of cases involving mental health issues but maintained that the sentencing risked sending mixed messages to potential offenders. She warned that it could imply that mitigating personal circumstances might lead to more lenient sentences, even for serious offences against children.\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Edwards’ defence team presented several mitigating factors for consideration. Philip Evans KC, representing Edwards, conveyed that his client was “profoundly sorry” for “betraying the priceless trust” of viewers and recognised the “repugnant nature of such images”.\nThe court heard how Edwards had sought to explain his behaviour to psychiatrists by referencing a difficult relationship with his “monstrous” father and struggles with low self-esteem. These issues were reportedly exacerbated by his perceived academic shortcomings, specifically his failure to secure a place at Oxford University, resulting in his attendance at Cardiff University instead.\nChief Magistrate Paul Goldspring, in his sentencing remarks, acknowledged these factors but emphasised the gravity of Edwards’ actions. He told the former newsreader, “It is not an exaggeration to say your long-earned reputation is in tatters.” However, the judge declined to impose a sexual harm prevention order, stating, “I am of the clear view that you do not present a risk or danger to the public at large, specifically to children. There is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation.”\nThis case has reignited discussions about the adequacy of current sentencing guidelines for offences involving child exploitation materials. Many are calling for a comprehensive review of how such crimes are punished, arguing that the current system fails to reflect the severe and lasting impact on victims.\nThe controversy surrounding Edwards’ sentence also raises questions about celebrity influence in the justice system and whether high-profile individuals receive preferential treatment. While the judge in this case explicitly stated that Edwards’ public status did not influence the sentencing decision, the public perception of inequality before the law remains a significant concern.\nFurthermore, the case has highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement and the judiciary in addressing online crimes, particularly those involving the exploitation of minors. As technology continues to evolve, so too must the legal framework and sentencing guidelines to ensure they adequately address the severity and complexity of these offences.\nThe Huw Edwards case has undoubtedly left a lasting mark on the British public consciousness, challenging perceptions of justice, celebrity, and the protection of society’s most vulnerable members. As the dust settles on this high-profile sentencing, it is clear that the debate it has sparked will continue for some time.\nThe coming months are likely to see increased scrutiny of sentencing guidelines, particularly in cases involving child exploitation materials. Campaigners, politicians, and members of the public will be watching closely to see if this case prompts any significant changes in how such offences are handled by the justice system.\nUltimately, the Huw Edwards case serves as a stark reminder of the complex challenges facing society in the digital age, where the lines between public and private behaviour are increasingly blurred, and where the exploitation of children remains an ever-present threat. As the nation grapples with these issues, the hope remains that this controversial verdict will catalyse meaningful change in how such crimes are perceived, prosecuted, and punished.\nLet’s not forget that he was in possession of class A images, how they were captured is too sick to imagine and this monster walked free.\nWhere is the justice for the innocent children? Let that sink in!",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_lets-talk-about-education/content_148.html": "Let’s talk about education\nIn the UK, there are approximately 600,000 pupils who attend independent schools, formerly referred to as public schools. The average fee is £18,000 per child per year, and Labour are planning to add VAT to this, which will increase fees by roughly £3,600 per year per child. Considering that less than 5% of the workforce earn over £100,000 per year, it would be reasonable to estimate that no more than 10% of pupils in independent schools come from families who can comfortably afford these fees. The vast majority are everyday people working two jobs and making sacrifices to give their children a better start in life with a better education.\nHowever, Labour despise this. They have meddled with education in the past and intend to do so again. This is little more than politics based on envy. They have not considered that less than 10% of children in independent schools come from families who would likely be able to afford the additional cost. This means that tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of children would be taken out of independent schools and placed into state schools, where they would cost the state far more than what would be raised in VAT.\nHow would our education system cope if, from September, there were an additional 200,000 to 300,000 pupils coming from independent schools back to state schools because their parents cannot afford the fees? Reform UK, on the other hand, understand that most parents are making a sacrifice to help their children attend independent schools. By sending their children to independent schools, they are also saving the state money, as the state would not have to spend money to educate these children.\nRather than add £3,600 on average to school fees, Reform UK would offer a 20% tax break to parents for sending their children to independent schools as a reward for contributing to their children’s education and saving the state money. Reform UK celebrates success and wishes to encourage it. The difference in what parents will pay for a child in an independent school under Reform UK and Labour is not just £3,600; it could be almost double that.\nIf you truly want to offer your children a better future, think very carefully and do not let Labour come to power. Thank you very much, and see you in the next video.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-roman-cyprus/content_374.html": "Overview\nThe Imperium Romannum differed fundamentally from Alexanders [the Great] empire in its social system, in its government, and as a geopolitical structure. The main territory and the centre of the power now lay in the west, while the control over part of the Near East (which Seleucid empire had already been unable to hold) was lost forever. Iran, Mesopotamia, and Arabia stayed outside the Roman Empire; from the first century onwards, they provided the setting for the Arsacid Parthian Empire, the new great power in in the East and Romes chief opponent, whose political successors were to include the Sassanids and, in the course of time, Islam. The “eastern question”, seemingly resolved through Hellenism, once more came to the fore.\nRoman Cyprus was a minor senatorial province within the Roman Empire. While it was a small province, it possessed several well known religious sanctuaries and figured prominently in Eastern Mediterranean trade, particularly the production and trade of Cypriot copper. As it was situated at a strategically important position along Eastern Mediterranean trade routes, Cyprus was controlled by imperial powers throughout the first millennium B.C. including: the Assyrians, Egyptians, Macedonians, and in particular the Romans. Cyprus was annexed by the Romans in 58 B.C., but until 22 B.C. when Cyprus became an official senatorial province, control over the island fluctuated between the Romans and the Ptolemaic Empire. From the Battle of Actium in 31 BC until the 7th century Cyprus was controlled by the Romans. Cyprus officially became part of the Eastern Roman Empire in 293 AD.\nUnder Roman rule, Cyprus was divided into four main districts, Salamis, Pafos, Amathous, and Lapethos. Pafos was the capital of the island throughout the Roman period until Salamis was re-founded as Constantia in 346 AD. The geographer Ptolemy recorded the following Roman cities: Pafos, Salamis, Amathous, Lapethos, Kition, Kourion, Arsinoe, Kyrenia, Chytri, Karpasia, Soli, and Tamassos, as well as some smaller cities scattered throughout the island.\nInformation about Cyprus during Roman rule is based primarily on archaeological findings and epigraphy. There is sparse literary evidence and very infrequent texts on which to base our knowledge\nWith the new border between East and West running along the edge of the Syrian desert and through the mountains of Armenia, Cyprus again changed its historic position. During the Hellenistic period, After Alexander had abolished the threshold between Europe and Asia, it was a secondary border zone between Egypt and Seleucid Syria. Now it was placed closer to the centre, amidst the political calm of Pax Romana.\nHowever, almost twenty years of turmoil under the declining republic had to pass before Cyprus could enjoy the quiet and uneventful existence of a minor Roman province. Rome had annexed the island in 58 B.C. under a double pretext. The disputed will of the last legitimate Ptolemaic ruler had promised Egypt -and thereby Cyprus- to Rome; at the same time, Cyprus, as a base of piracy in the eastern Mediterranean, was to lose its autonomy altogether. But the real reasons behind this scheme were political and economic. After the annexation of Syria, Cyprus as the only independent Hellenistic monarchy, represented the last stage in the encirclement of Egypt; its wealth and its natural resources further made it almost irresistibly attractive to a government and an aristocracy permanently in financial straits. Another important point had to be considered; by `entrusting’ M. Porcius Cato with the official takeover of the island, Clodius Pulcher, one of Caesars chief followers, had succeeded in removing from Rome a difficult contender at a critical time.\nThe fate of the island, for the time being incorporated in the province of Cilicia, illustrated the part played by straightforward greed and financial speculation in the Roman takeover. Like other provincial territories in the late republic, Cyprus provided many an opportunity to make or at least recover fortunes. Ptolemaios, whom Cato offered the position of High Priest of Aphrodite in place of his former throne, had committed suicide by poison, and Cato administered the former royal fortune, which had yielded a revenue of 7,000 talents per year, with the utmost integrity. Cicero, who was governor of Cyprus 51-50 B.C., though ostensibly correct, proved himself in the end unable to resist some unsavoury financial machinations. Otherwise, the island was ruthlessly exploited by officials and businessmen for the next ten years. The terms of a `loan’ given to the city of Salamis by a consortium headed by M. Brutus were highly revealing; the interest fixed at 48%, was collected by Roman cavalry.\nDuring the Roman civil war, Cyprus resumed a brief romantic role under the Egyptian crown, when it was returned to Cleopatra, first by Caesar (47 B.C.) after the end of the Alexandrine war, and again by Marcus Antonius (36 B.C.). Octavians victory at Actium (31 B.C.) finally brought the island under Roman rule, under which it was to remain for nearly three centuries.\nIn the Roman inland lake, which the Mediterranean had become, Cyprus had little strategic significance. In 22 B.C. after the general consolidation in the east, Cyprus exchanged its status from an [imperial]- i.e. under the direct administration of Augustus (Octavian) and under military occupation- to a [senatorial] province. Separated from Cilicia in 27 B.C., Cyprus was ruled by a pro-consul as civil governor. Its capital was still Paphos, -Augusta Claudia Flavia Paphos-, which had steadily grown in importance since the Ptolemies as a political and religious centre and, as a result of the silting-up of the harbour of Salamis, one of the major ports. Paphos, Amathus, Salamis, and Lapethos each formed and administrative region. With municipal autonomy, elected officials and a considerable degree of independence in religious and cultural matters, the island enjoyed greater freedom than under Egyptian rule. The -Koinon- of the different cities, which was still chiefly an institution for the advance of the cult of the Emperor and for the organization of games, like the Roman senate, had the right to issue bronze coinage.\nTo Cyprus, the centuries of the Pax Romana formed an uneventful, though contended period. a population unused to political independence or democratic institutions did not find Roman rule oppressive. The political peace of the island suffered a single interruption through the great Jewish rising of A.D. 115-6 which affected Cyprus as it did Cyrenaica and Egypt; the excesses of the rebels -vastly exaggerated contemporary figures speak of 240,000 dead on Cyprus alone- were followed by terrible counter measures under Trajans general Lusius Quietus and by the expulsion of the Jews from the island.\nIn other spheres, after a brief depression in the first century B.C. Hellenism continued to flower under a competent and liberal Roman administration. The early years of the Roman empire brought outstanding prosperity to Cyprus; the luxury of its cities, as well as the reputation for immorality and indolence -[infamem nimic calore Cypron]- inevitably bring to mind the years of Lusignan rule, except that, in contrast to the Middle Ages, it was thriving in the centre of a peaceful political system and enjoying all the advantages of a great self-sufficient economic region with a unified legal and financial system. The old-established trade of India and Southern Arabia with Italy and the west, in which Cyprus had long established a secure place, intensified; the island itself was opened up by a system of Roman roads and the ports were further developed. Its diverse produce -timber, wine, oil, grain, copper, and silver- found a ready market throughout the imperium; it was a Cypriot boast of this period, that it was possible to build and equip a ship entirely with local materials.\nAll the important centres were transformed by the town-planners, even more than in Hellenistic times. Great -Fora-, colonnaded squares, temples, theatres, thermae, and aquaducts were built, above all in Paphos and Salamis; Soli acquired its first theatre and a public library, Curium extended the sanctuary of Apollo Hylates. In Cyprus, as elsewhere, every aspect of day-to-day existence as well as the cultural and intellectual life was deeply influenced by the Mediterranean, Hellenistic-inspired, civilisation of Imperium Romanum. The process of the assimilation and Romanization /Hellenization of the people of the island, begun in the fourth century B.C., was completed, although as in other eastern provinces, the oriental tradition lay below the Hellenistic veneer. Thus the cult of Aphrodite, whose origins in the rites of the eastern goddess of fertility had never been forgotten, continued; her temple in old Paphos has remained one of the most famous shrines of the Mediterranean until the present day. Roman coins displaying the temple temple with the conical stone (which takes place of the cult image or fertility symbol) carried the fame of the goddess throughout the whole empire; emperors like Titus and Septimius Severius brought offerings to her. A road flanked by small chapels led from New Paphos to a much frequented pilgrimage centre; `Men and women from many cities annually march in procession to Paphos along this road’.\nYet, in the course of time, the cult of Aphrodite gave way to Christianity, leading eventually to the replacement of the goddess by the Panagia. Its geographic position, as well as its strong Jewish population -composed to some extent of refugees from various persecutions- helped to make Cyprus one of the earliest missionary realms. Although St Paul and St Barnabas (Joseph, the Levite, from Salamis) met with little success amongst the Jews of Cyprus during their mission of the year A.D. 45, St Paul was able to convert the Roman Pro Consul Sergius in Paphos; the island thus became the first territory to be ruled by a Christian, even though only for a short span. On a second missionary journey the hostility of the Synagogues proved Barnabas undoing and he suffered martyrdom in his native city. The rise of the Cypriot church between these events and the reign of Constantine the Great is shrouded in legend; its first genuinely historic representatives -St Hilarion, St Epiphanios of Salamis, and St Spyridon of Tremithus- are contemporary with the Council of Nicaea (325). At least three bishoprics, Paphos, Salamis, and Tremithus, were established at that time. The expansion of Christianity therefore cannot have been altogether negligible, although the temples of Paphos and Soli, amongst others, were still in use in the fourth century A.D. While we know practically nothing of the relationship with pagan cults and their centres on the island, it is clear that the synthesis of old and new cultures- by no means confined to Cyprus even then- had already begun, as the church of Panagia Aphroditissa, which was built slightly later at Paphos, proves. The most remarkable evidence of the meeting of old and new faith is the early fifth century A.D. mosaic inscription at Curium, where Christ is described in archaistic couplets as the protector of the city in place of Phoebus Apollo.\nThe turmoils of the third century, the military anarchy of the soldier emperors and the wars on the northern and eastern frontiers of the empire obviously barely touched the island except, briefly, in A.D. 269, when a Gothic fleet reached Cyprus in the course of its Mediterranean travels in search of pillage, having previously attacked Crete and Rhodes. The economic depression, similarly, is less marked than in the west of the empire, although the trade with the east suffered noticeably under the pressure of the new Persian dynasty of the Sassanids, who had come to power in A.D. 224. Only the struggles within the Empire under Diocletian and Constantine (A.D. 284-337) ended the peaceful isolation of Cyprus. Once more, the island was cast into the stream of events and its destiny took a new turn.\nPolitical timeline\nCyprus had been under the rule of Ptolemaic Egypt prior to it becoming a Roman province. King Ptolemy, son of the King of Egypt Ptolemy IX Lathyros, reigned over Cyprus from 88 to 58 BC. After Ptolemy refused to put up ransom when Publius Clodius Pulcher was kidnapped by Cilician pirate, Cyprus was abruptly annexed by Rome and added as part of the Cilician province. The Lex Clodia de Cyprus was passed by the Concilium Plebis in 58 BC and Cato was sent to Cyprus as its new proconsul. Cato offered Ptolemy the position of the High Priest at Pafos but Ptolemy refused and instead took his own life. Cato sold much of the royal possessions and brought back 7000 talents to Rome after taking his share of the profits.\nDuring this time Cyprus was exploited by the Roman rulers who saw positions in the provinces as stepping stone in Roman politics. In 50 BC Cicero Minor, son of the famous orator, was given the proconsulship in Cyprus and was more sympathetic to the Cypriot people. However, by the end of his proconsulship there was much political turmoil in Rome and Rome lost control of Cyprus in 47 BC. Marc Antony and Octavian, later Augustus, were struggling for power after Julius Caesar’s death and in 40 BC Marc Antony gave Cyprus to Cleopatra VII, Queen of Ptolemaic Egypt, as a gift. The Battle of Actium in 31 BC marked the end of the civil war with Octavian gaining control of all of Egypt and Cyprus. Cyprus was left under control of Octavian’s legate until it could be further dealt with. In 22 BC Cyprus was separated from the Cilicia and became a senatorial province without a standing army.\nCyprus was divided into four regions with thirteen known cities with Nea Pafos becoming the capital.[7] Cyprus was allowed a large amount of autonomy remaining mainly Greek in culture while adopting and adapting Roman customs. No Roman colonies were settled on the island. During this time period there are very few primary literary sources that mention Cyprus, let alone provide a detailed history. However, epigraphic and archaeological evidence indicates thriving economic, culture and civic life in Cyprus throughout the Roman period.\nIn 45 AD Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas visited Cyprus as part of Paul’s first missionary journey to convert the people to Christianity.[8] St. Barnabas returned for a second visit in 49 AD but the spread of Christianity was slow, especially in the rural areas. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD by Vespasian, the Roman Emperor, and his son Titus there was a large influx of Jewish refugees into Cyprus. In 115-117 AD a widespread Jewish revolt (Kitos War) resulted in thousands of deaths in Cyprus and around the Eastern Empire and in the expulsion of Jews from Cyprus. In 269 AD there was a brief Gothic invasion (Battle of Naissus) throughout the eastern empire including Cyprus. In 293 AD Cyprus became part of the Eastern Empire as the Roman Empire was divided under the Diocletianic reforms.\nRoman military on Cyprus\nThere was very little significant Roman military presence on Cyprus, with the exception of two notable incidents; a local council was barricaded into their own council house by an equestrian troop and the Jewish massacre at Salamis which required outside military intervention. The proconsul had a legatus subordinate, which points to at least a token military presence, but there is almost no evidence of there being anything larger than the praetorian bodyguards on the island.\nEvery province of the Roman Empire was required to send men to fill the ranks of the Roman army as conscripts and Cyprus was no exception. The Cypriots contributed some 2000 men to the foreign auxilia at any one time, but there are no notable military figures from Cyprus. There are two cohorts of auxiliary troops that performed well enough to be given the honor of citizenship before their 25 years of service was up, but other than those there is no other known outstanding Cypriot units.\nRoman administrative system\nThe Roman administrative system was also fairly light; it seems that only unfavored citizens were sent to govern the island. The basic structure consisted of a proconsul at the top representing the Roman Senate and the emperor with two assistants in the form of a legatus and a quaestor. The proconsul had several duties, including:\nHigh court judicial duties; if the magistrate and the local council couldn’t rule on it, it was brought to the proconsul investing the high priest (of the Imperial cult) with his power as the representative for the emperor consecrating Imperial statues and buildings in the name of the emperor he promoted public and civic (construction) works such as aqueducts, roads, and centres of entertainment (such as theatres) it was his responsibility to decide on funding for “extravagant projects” such as honorary equestrian statues or repaving sanctuaries he was also responsible for the internal security of the island\nThe Cypriots were essentially peaceful; there is no mention of outlaws needing to be dealt with or crimes severe enough to need police intervention, there was no real policing force on the island for the proconsul to oversee. The closest thing to a police force was a hipparch in office in Soli under Hadrian’s rule, but this seems to have been a temporary situation.\nUnder the proconsul and the legate were the local councils; these were led by archons who were elected annually from among the members of the council. There were several other positions associated with the councils, but they are all local officials and not directly part of the Roman administrative structure.\nThe quaestor handled tax collection on the island; he had a board of ten Cypriots in each city to help him with his duties. In addition to this force, there were publicani who would bid for the right to collect taxes in each region. The terms of office for the proconsul and the legate were staggered with that of the quaestor, that is to say the proconsul and the legate would see the last six months of the old quaestor’s term and the first six months of the new one’s term.\nEconomy and trade\nEconomy\nThe Roman period was one of the most prosperous in Cyprus’ history. Evidence of luxury items acquired through trade, impressively large administrative buildings in cities like Salamis, and richly decorated mansion homes like those found in Pafos point to a thriving economy. The island was mostly self-sufficient and prospered through the utilization and trade of natural resources. After the Romans annexed Cyprus in 58 B.C., it entered into a period of production and widespread trade facilitated by the pax romana. This is shown in the archaeological evidence of the coastal cities flourishing, Cypriot markets in Syria and Palestine, and extensive coin circulation.\nThe City was the basic economic unit of the Roman Empire; it could interact with its surrounding agricultural hinterland in one of two ways. In the first, a sort of symbiotic relationship, the city would act as a redistribution center and manufactured goods needed by the agricultural area supporting it. In the second, a more parasitic relationship, the city center would redistribute agricultural surplus while manufacturing goods to be sold or traded with other centers. The role of the city was determined by its proximity to an important trade route. The major coastal cities of Cyprus which showed this kind of economic growth were Pafos, Amathous, and Salamis.\nThe Roman emphasis on the importance of cities was indicated by its dedication to constructing a network of roads. In Cyprus, roads were initially funded by the Emperor, but the island soon grew rich enough to finance its own construction in the period of Severan dynasty.\nThe great wealth of Cyprus came from its vast system of trade. Cypriot trade economy was based on resources of the island: wine, oil, grain, copper, minerals, timber, glass, and shipbuilding. With the port cities acting as distribution centers, Cyprus had connections with other locations across the Mediterranean, and seafaring was an important aspect of Cypriot daily life and culture. The extent of trade can be proven archaeologically through the wide array of foreign items found on the island, particularly coins.\nDespite the destruction caused by six earthquakes that wracked the island in the Roman period, the Cypriot economy remained relatively steady. The role of the port cities in trade were crucial to the Roman administration; after an earthquake in AD 76 destroyed the city of Kourion, Imperial Rome sent immense amounts of funding to rebuild the city, as evidenced by a large influx of coins in the following year.\nRoads\nAncient roads can be studied through literary, epigraphic (e.g. milestones), topographical, and archaeological evidence. The division of Cyprus into two, the buffer zone and military occupied areas make many parts of the island unavailable for study. It is estimated that 10% of the island is inaccessible for various reasons.[12] Studying the Roman road system and its milestones helps in partially establishing the boundaries of territories in Cyprus.\nThere are several sources that can be used to get information about Cyprus’ ancient roads. The Geography of Strabo (23 AD) gives several distances and mentions the highway between Palaipafos and Neo Pafos. Pliny the Elder, in Natural History (77-79 AD) talks about the size of Cyprus and lists fifteen cities, including three no longer extant.\nThe Peutinger Table (Tabula Peutingeriana) is a 13th-century AD copy of an older map of Roman Cyprus. The exact date of the original Peutinger Table is unknown, but is estimated to be from the 2nd to 4th century BC. It is an illustrated version of an itinerary, which is a list of notable places with descriptions and the distances between each place. The map is distorted, north-south is compressed and east-west is stretched out. The roads on Cyprus are shown as an oval which is bisected by a diagonal section of the road. No other roads are depicted.\nThe Geography of Claudius Ptolemy also talks about Cyprus but the accuracy of this information varies for different areas of Cyprus. For example, some distances are overestimated, underestimated, or come very close to reality. Ptolemy doesn’t mention any roads. Another map is the Kitchener map (1885). It is useful because it helps to distinguish older roads from the twentieth century roads.\nThere are also travellers’ reports and local informants. Claude D. Cobham compiled travellers’ reports and descriptions in Excepta Cypria (1918). There are also the works of Luigi de Palma Cesnola and D.G. Hogarth, both of whom used local informants. Their works are useful because it has information about Cyprus during its late Ottoman stage, before the British changed anything.\nMilestones are an important source because they give route information and they can be dated. Thirty Roman milestones have been found and recorded. Most of them were in mountainous regions and all are located in the coastal highway circling the island. In other areas of the island, where building materials were scarce, milestones were reused. Milestone inscriptions included the mileage and the names and titles of the rulers that contributed to the milestone placement. From these inscriptions other types of information can be inferred. For example, we know that the major road along the southern coast was a part of the Imperial network. Mitford uses the inscriptions to describe the Emperors’ and other government involvement in the roads. He says that three phases of the Roman Cyprus road network emerges from the inscriptions. First, Augustus and Titus are the self-proclaimed creators of the road system. Second, in the Severan period the responsibility of road repairs was given to cities while the proconsul coordinated their activities. The third phase was a century and a half of stagnation and milestones were reused for Imperial propaganda or to express loyalty.\nIn the Roman Empire, roads were open for everyone to travel. People traveled on foot, by two and four-wheeled vehicles, or by horse and donkey. In the ancient world, where very few people had maps, roads offered predictability and a guarantee that there were no natural obstacles ahead, which usually meant long detours. Traveling on a road also meant greater speed and the possibility of encountering inns, shrines, and springs.\nBefore the Roman period Cyprus already had a system of main roads and during Roman rule secondary roads were added. The roads in Cyprus often did not meet Roman standards and preexisting roads were not changed to meet them. Although, milestone inscriptions indicate renovations in AD 198, at least in West Cyprus. During the Severan period road maintenance was a civic duty. Throughout the Roman period it is uncertain if the central government paid for the roads completely or shared the costs with nearby cities.\nInformal cross-country roads were used in addition to the formal roads. The roads converged on the main economic center, Salamis. Along with the main roads, minor roads radiated from a city. This layout shows the influence of economic forces in creating roads. These minor roads connected the surrounding areas to the urban market. There were also the benefits of ensuring the import of food into cities, thus reducing the risk of famine.\nCoinage\nAlthough the minting and circulation of Cypriot coins has not yet been exhaustively studied, there is sufficient evidence to show widespread trade routes and interaction with other cultures in the Roman world. There are two main types of evidence in coinage: coins minted in or for Cyprus, and all coins circulating within the province during Roman times. After 30 B.C. the nature of coinage became more “Romanized”; coin type and manufacture did not remain static over time, and styles and imagery of coins changed frequently. Provincial coins were minted at Pafos and Salamis, as well as “regal” coins specific to each reigning Emperor in his time. The Koinon was responsible for the coinage, as well as the emperor cult and organization of festivals. For a detailed compilation of each type of coin for each Emperor during this period.\nCopper\nCopper mining in Cyprus has an extensive history which flourished in the Bronze Age and continued into the Roman Period. The extent of copper mining in the Roman Period was scaled down significantly, and were under direct imperial control. The three important cities that continued copper mining in the classical period were Amathous, Tamassos, and Soli. The well-preserved mining site located near Soli was Skouriotissa, which contains chaclopyrite deposits that were extensively mined during Roman Period.[18] Recent analysis and location of slag heaps from Roman mines suggests a shift in the social organization of mining in classical times. Some slag heaps were located almost 2 miles away from the mining location[17] suggesting that the copper workers transported the copper ore away from the mines before they decided to smelt the copper out and work with it. This is a significant change from earlier mining settlements in which the copper was melted on site or very near the place where it was extracted.\nReligion and social history\nKoinon\nIn order to maintain some degree of autonomy after control of the island shifted to the Roman Empire, the various cities of Cyprus maintained a collective administrative body that reflected Hellenistic values introduced by the Ptolemaic dynasty at the end of the 4th century. Under the Ptolemies, the cities of Cyprus were allowed a degree of autonomy that was unfamiliar and somewhat unexpected. In order to maintain solidarity throughout the kingdom, the cities formed parliamentary committees with each other. Though the resulting confederation of Cypriot cities does not have an exact date of origin, the term Koinon—meaning “common”—began to appear on inscriptions around the middle of the 2nd century B.C. Little is known about the exact function of the Koinon, though it seems to have been grounded in religion due to its initial associations with religious festivals at the Temple of Aphrodite, which was located at Palaipafos.\nThe large number of people that gathered at the Temple likely realized a need for religious unity amongst all of them; thus, the Koinon was formed to coordinate pancyprian religious festivals. Soon, the meetings of the Koinon began to stray from strictly religious matters and focus more on the social and political aspects of the country, including unifying the various districts and cities in terms of political representation. These assumptions are based on inscriptions on statues and other dedicatory epigraphical evidence around the island that implies that the Koinon had a presence all over Cyprus, as well as the money and influence to affect many different cities. Thus, the purpose of the Koinon shifted from autonomous parliamentary committees during the Hellenistic period to a religiously motivated pancyprian political body. The administrative privileges of the Koinon, by the end of the Roman period, included minting its own coins, participating in political relations with Rome, and bestowing honorary distinctions upon notable individuals. Inscriptions on statues, as previously mentioned, attest to this final function and indicate the fact that the Koinon was most likely a funded organization which received its dues in the form of an annual contribution from each city.\nThe Koinon therefore maintained a great deal of power because it essentially controlled all forms of religion on the entirety of Cyprus. This power is later utilized to deify some of the Roman emperors starting with Augustus and ending with the dynasty of Septimius Severus. Known evidence in the form of inscriptions and dedications indicates with certainty that the emperors Augustus, Caracalla, Titus, Tiberius, Trajan, Vespasian, Claudius, Nero, and Septimius Severus and his succeeding dynasty all formed imperial cults that were represented on Cyprus. These cults were mostly formed by the emperors in an attempt to solidify their right to rule and gain religious support as peers of the Roman pantheon of gods.\nReligion and imperial cults\nAs far back in Cyprus’ history as archaeological evidence exists, so too do examples of religion. Around the middle of the 4th century B.C., a new ruling dynasty—the Ptolemies—gained power over Cyprus and established imperial cult over the existing religions on the island. This imperial cult put the king at the head of religious observance on the island, and dictated that he was on an equal footing with other gods. To the average citizen, the king was considered a direct representative or descendant of the gods. It is easy to see the extent to which politics and religion became intertwined not only with each other, but with society as well; the king maintained control over the Koinon, an administrative body founded by the various cities scattered across Cyprus for the purpose of coordinating religious activities and festivals. Imperial cult continued to exist throughout Roman occupation of Cyprus, and a number of unique cults emerged from this transition to the Roman period.\nAfter Augustus gained control of Rome—and Cyprus with it—the island’s inhabitants seemed perfectly willing to accept the divinity of the new emperor. Much of our information about Roman religion on the island comes from five sources: ancient literature, Cypriot numismatics, excavations and archaeological work, epigraphy, and burials. Through an analysis of these sources, where appropriate, scholars have been able to come up with an idea of how Roman involvement affected Cypriot religion.\nOne example of epigraphy that illustrates the Roman Imperial cult is found on a white marble slab that originated from the Temple of Aphrodite at Palaipafos. Essentially, this text contains an oath of obedience that the priests at the temple would be forced to abide by. The oath invokes the names of the Roman gods in a manner that suggests that the ruler—in this case, the emperor Tiberius Augustus—is comparable or equal to the pantheon of other gods. Each god and goddess named represents a different region of Cyprus; thus, the tablet is basically confirming the entire island’s allegiance to the Roman empire. The tablet leaves little doubt that future generations must continue to support the emperor and his family in all regards. Evidence of imperial cult through inscriptions can be found as far back as the earliest Ptolemaic rulers, and continue on until 391 A.D., when the Roman emperor Theodosius I outlawed all pagan worship in the empire.\nThe pagan Temple of Aphrodite at Palaipafos retained its religious importance to the island even after the founding of Pafos at the dawn of the Hellenistic period. Ancient literary sources tell us that men and women from all over the island would walk from Pafos to Palaipafos as part of a religious ceremony honoring Aphrodite. It seems that the importance of this religious festival helped maintain the status of the city throughout the Roman period.\nThe importance of the cult of Aphrodite is unquestionable, along with its wealth. For this reason, the high priest at Paphos was granted far more power than his involvement in mere religious functions; instead, the priesthood became more like a theocracy. Evidence from inscriptions suggests that the high priest may have had a hand in all religious matters across the entirety of the island.\nThe temple at Palaipafos was the leading center for the emperor cult. At the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., a statue of the Roman emperor Caracalla was consecrated at Pafos. In the year proceeding, a second statue of the emperor was erected, this time at Palaipafos. Inscriptions at the old city suggest that aside from Aphrodite, only the Roman emperor was worshiped there. Even at the new city, worship was reserved to only a few gods and the emperor. These gods were most likely Zeus Polieus, Aphrodite, and Hera, while the emperor was worshiped down to the end of the Severan Dynasty–Septimius Severus—the final emperor who enforced imperial cult. Beginning with Augustus in the early first century, Pafos welcomed the emperor as a living god, and inscriptions prove the promised fidelity of the inhabitants of not only Pafos, but all of Cyprus to the new emperor.\nDespite seeming reluctant to acquire the title, Augustus, the first Roman emperor, was treated as a god on Cyprus. Even the emperor’s daughter, Julia, and his wife, Livia, became “the Goddess Augusta and the Goddess the New Aphrodite,” respectively. It seems that there was no shortage of priests and other religious figures more than willing to acknowledge the emperor’s divinity in exchange for recognition from Rome. Titles began to be conferred between Rome and the priesthood to solidify each other’s right to authority. As previously mentioned, the main method by which the imperial cult ordained its members was through an oath of allegiance to the emperor. Countless statues and other monuments were erected in nearly all of the cities of Cyprus; for instance, a statue of the emperor Vespasian was erected in Salamis by the gymnasiarchs there, but was consecrated by a religious figure. This monument to the emperor reinforces the idea that there was a strong connection between the activities of the state and the pagan cults.\nA number of other pagan cults are known to have existed across the island, centered primarily around the major cities of Cyprus. These cities usually had large temples that were dedicated to a specific patron god of the city: in Amathus as in Palaipafos, Aphrodite had her own cult; in Salamis, Zeus Olympius; Pafos contained cults for the gods Asclepius, Hygieia, and Apollo; in Curium, Apollo Hylates. Though these are but a few examples of the many numerous cults, it is important to note that many gods had temples and dedications in many different locations, but not every god is represented. Because Aphrodite is said to have been born from the sea foam around Cyprus, she appears to be consistently worshiped across the island, as evidenced by recurring temples dedicated in her honor. For each of these cults, the method of worship was different; it is hard to say with certainty what each temple did specifically, but we do know from numismatic evidence and literary records that the cult of Aphrodite likely involved prostitution but not blood sacrifice of animals. It is assumed that a majority of these cults followed similar worship services to those found in the corresponding temples in Rome and other locations around the Empire. Despite this assumption, there does not seem to be much evidence to pinpoint specific details surrounding the cult procedures.\nWhile Roman imperial cult maintained significance up until the late 4th century, the ancient pantheon of gods slowly faded out of existence along the way. Following the emperor Caracalla’s death in 217 A.D., inscriptions have nothing more to say about cults such as the Paphian Aphrodite, the Zeus of Salamis, or the Apollo of Hyle at Curium. Each of these cults had enjoyed a long and prosperous history on the island, and, like the imperial cult, seemed to disappear rather suddenly around the 3rd and 4th centuries—the period of Severan rule. All across the island, both imperial cult and the traditional gods began to lack the necessary power to sustain religious faith; after the Roman period, the citizens of Cyprus began to turn to newer, more private gods that were easily accessible and suited to the needs of the individual.\nJewish Revolt\nUnder the reign of Ptolemy I, there was a large exodus of Jews from Palestine to other areas of the Mediterranean. (Hill 241) Their increasing presence on Cyprus most likely occurred due to the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD. (Karageorghis 181) A large representation of the Cypriot population, the Jews were also strongly involved in the copper industry. As noted by inscriptions on the construction of a local synagogue, the community of Jews were also possibly on the island to supply wine for the services at the Temple of Jerusalem. (Mitford 1380) With years of building tension with the Romans, during the reign of Trajan in 116 AD, the Jews revolted at Salamis, as well as in Egypt and Cyrene (Hill 242). The most destruction however occurred at Salamis, where there were no stationed Roman garrisons or troops. Led by Artemion, it is estimated that over 240,000 perished in the revolt (Hill 242). Detailed by the writings of Cassius Dio, the Jews brutally massacred every non-Jew in the city. (Mitford 1380) The revolt was quickly quelled by the Roman General Lusius Quietus (Hill 242). All Jews were expelled permanently from the island and even those that were driven there by storm were executed immediately. (Karageorghis 181) Although archaeological evidence suggests that in later centuries the Jewish community was re-established.\nIntroduction and spread of Christianity\nIn AD 45, St. Paul went on his first missionary journey to Cyprus with St. Barnabas, a native Cypriot Jew, and John Mark. Starting at Antioch, they traveled to the port of Seleucia and onwards to Salamis to preach Christianity. As noted in the Acts of the Apostles 13:1-14:27, on their journey to Pafos, Paul and Barnabas encountered the Roman Proconsul Sergius Paulus and a Jewish sorcerer, Elymas Bar-Jesus. Upon hearing Paul’s words, Bar-Jesus was temporarily blinded, and this act convinced Sergius Paulus to convert to Christianity. He was the first Roman governor to do so.\nAfter a quarrel with Paul, Barnabas and John Mark traveled back to Cyprus on his second missionary journey. During his preaching at Salamis, Barnabas was murdered by a group of Jews. John Mark buried him with a copy of the gospel of St. Matthew, which Barnabas always carried with him.\nMajor basilicas and churches\nThe ancient village of Kopetra in the Vasilikos valley contains the remains of three churches dating to the Late Roman period. The first, a small basilica located at the site of Sirmata, dates to around the beginning of the 7th century. The basilica contains a crypt with two tombs. The construction styles of the tombs suggest the second was added later, around the middle of the 7th century. The central courtyard of the basilica was surrounded on three sides by rooms which may have served as domestic spaces for the religious community living there. A cistern had also been cut into one corner of the courtyard. The basilica was close to and yet separate from the nearby village, reflecting the spirit of monasticism in early Christianity. The second church, which was located to the south of Kopetra, was similar in design and proportions to the Sirmata basilica. The remains of a mosaic floor have been found in the sanctuary, although the original subject remains a mystery. The third and largest of the three churches lies to the northeast of Kopetra. The architectural style is similar to the other two Kopetra churches, yet also reflects many characteristics of churches built across the island during the 5th and 6th centuries. The dome covering the sanctuary once held a colorful glass mosaic. All three churches were likely maintained and used until they were abandoned some time in the 7th century.\nThe basilica of Kourion was built over the remains of the buildings destroyed in the earthquake of A.D. 365. Although its proportions were a little longer than other examples, the basilica was internally similar in architecture to other 5th-century churches and basilicas. The ruined buildings provided all the limestone, granite, and marble needed to build the new church. Remains of a mosaic between the windows in the sanctuary have been found among the ruins. A well-preserved mosaic belonging to one of the previous buildings has been found beneath the floor of the diakonikon. A total of forty inscriptions have been found in and around the basilica, although most remain only in fragments and were only preserved by the reuse of materials after the basilica was abandoned. The earliest inscription dates from the 3rd century BCE, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphos. The inscriptions dating to the Roman Period on Cyprus include one honoring the proconsul Julianus, and another which mentions the gymnasium of Kourion. The basilica was destroyed by an earthquake in the 7th century. Remains suggest that the building was not immediately abandoned, but was still used until the 8th century.\nThe Late Roman site of Maroni Petrera is located along the south coast of Cyprus in the Maroni Valley near the modern village of Maroni. The remains of a church have been uncovered at this site as part of the Maroni Valley Archaeological Survey Project (MVASP) founded in 1990. The Petrera church was the religious center for the Maroni valley, yet archaeological evidence of a complex of rooms and courtyards separate from the church indicate that the site was also associated with storage and agricultural production. Recovered remains indicate that the decoration of the church was relatively plain; there is almost no evidence of mosaics, wall-paintings, or the use of marble. Otherwise, the Petrera church was architecturally similar to contemporary Christian buildings in Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean.\nRoman Cypriot burials\nBurial customs are typically slow to change, even during times of social transition and foreign influence. Burial customs on Cyprus during the Hellenistic period were largely retained during the Roman period. Nevertheless, the study of these customs can still provide a great deal of insight into who was living in Cyprus at the time and the extent of their influence. The tombs of Roman Cyprus typically were cave-like chambers with sloping dromos, the ends of which were sealed with earth and occasionally with stone. The number, size, and ornamentation of these chambers in differed according to wealth, ethnicity, and the dates of construction. Multiple burials, in which all members of a family shared a tomb, continued to be popular into the Roman period. The typical burial chamber was an elongated rectangle, with side niches or accompanying chambers. Loculi, or rectangular bed-like areas for the dead, were often attached to the chambers, radiating in a symmetrical fashion. Plaques next to loculi with inscriptions of the names of the dead or proverbs in honour of the dead were not uncommon. Epitaphs containing ethnic adjectives, or titles indicating rank or status, have proved helpful in determining the context of certain burials. Identification of the dead was also located on cippi, located directly above the tomb. Cippi are carved-stone altars comprising a base, a narrow shaft, and a cap. Inscriptions labelling the tombs were made on the shafts of the cippi, and other forms of ornamentation (such as foliage) were common. The living could honor their dead by placing flowers on the cippus or pouring libations on the cippus. Gifts continued to be incorporated into burial, as seen in early period of Cypriot history. Jewellery, imported Roman pottery, local imitation pottery, gold wreaths, and glass were common burial gifts. Mummy portraits, depicting the deceased wearing gold wreaths and busts or stelae of the dead, began to emerge as a result of Alexandrian influence. Lamps, cookware, and libation vessels have been excavated in these tombs, suggesting the continuation of funerary feasts of the living during the Roman period on Cyprus.\nTomb structures that are unique or scarcely located are assumed to be those of the elite, or foreign. Uncommon burial practices that occurred during Roman Cyprus included cremation, tumulus tombs, sarcophagi, and peristyle tombs. A multitude of tombs in Nea Pafos, excavated by M. Markides in 1915, represent Peristyle tombs. Peristyle tombs typically had a long, stepped dromos, a long rectangular vaulted room with radiating loculi, and several minor chambers (one located directly behind the other). These are attributed to either Egyptian-born individuals, or Cypriot elite who wished to be buried in the Alexandrian fashion, because Nea Pafos was a significant site of contact with Egypt. Luigi palma di Cesnola and others extensively excavated the site of Kourion. The Roman tombs excavator here were elaborate and highly representative of Roman burial outside of Cyprus. Tomb 8, detailed my George McFadden had a stepped dromos with oblong ashars along the sides. The tomb had a saddled roof, and two large chambers with doorways. The doorways were accented by decorated posts and lintels. The interpretation of the complexity of this tomb is under debate. Another example of a tomb likely belonging to a foreign family is tomb 26 of the Swedish Cyprus excavation in the early 20th century at Amathus. The tomb is an unusual, large, flat tumulus tomb built upon a rock. The tomb has a circular shaft with a stone pithos in middle. Inside the pithos is an alabastron containing carefully washed, cremated bones. Other rare discoveries of Roman-period cremation remains have been found in cylindrical lead urns.\nUnfortunately, Cypro-Classical and Hellenistic tombs have been difficult for archaeologists to define because of haphazard excavation of tombs on Cyprus, as with other sites. Looting or treasure-seeking individuals often left tombs in unpreferable conditions, void of archaeological context, making modern research difficult, if not impossible.[40] Additional prime examp les of burials during the Roman period on Cyprus can be observed at the sites of Agioi Omologites – Nicosia, the necropolis at Marion, the necropolis near Skouriotissa, and tombs of Pafos, Curium, Kition, and Salamis.\nWomen in Cyprus\nFor women on Cyprus during the Roman period, life was restricted mainly to domestic activities. Based on the large amount of epigraphical material from Mesaoria and the southern coast of Cyprus, women did have a part in public life. One-third of these epitaphs are to women. Most of these women mentioned are married to men of status and wealth, or come from wealthy families. This was the most common way for a woman to have a public life. For example, a woman from Salamis, the wife of a Salaminian High Priest of the Augusti, was honored by the Koinon for her public spirit. In addition, a Claudia Appharion, the High Priestess of Demeter for the entire island, was distinguished publicly as well. A woman belonging to a Senatorial family, and a benefactress of Pafos were also honored for their public spirit. Women were mainly left to household duties, but those of particular wealth, or married to men of political or high social status could make a name for themselves. Religion was really the only other avenue left to women to create a public identity.\nArt and culture\nGlass in Roman Cyprus\nBefore the invention of glass blowing in the mid first-century BC, glass had been a fairly rare and expensive luxury commodity, the use of which was mostly confined to containers for perfume and cosmetics. However, with the invention of glass blowing, glass became much more widely available and affordable and began to be produced on a much larger scale with factories dedicated to the production of glass being established throughout the Roman world, including Cyprus. Though it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between locally produced Cypriot glass and imported glass in Cyprus, it can be conclusively stated that glass was in fact being manufactured locally within the island. Evidence for this can be found in sites such as Salamis, Tamassos, Limassol and Amathus. A glass workshop was discovered at Tamassos by Ohnefalsch Richter though he was unfortunately unable to fully publish his findings. He does however mention the discovery of a glass furnace which points to glass being manufactured at the site. Although his discoveries were never dated precisely, many consider it likely that they dated to the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD. Blocks of glass were discovered at Salamis which seems to indicate that this was another glass production center though a furnace associated with this site has not yet been discovered. Cypriot glass is thought to have flourished in the Antonine and Severan periods, or from 140 AD to 240 AD and indeed most of the glass discovered is dated to this time. The fact that the economy in Cyprus was flourishing during this period further supports this conclusion.\nOlaf Vessberg studied the large quantities of glass found in the tombs of Limassol and Amathus and made several discoveries. First of these was that Cypriot glass is fairly homogeneous. Its function was for the most part limited to daily use, being employed either toward cosmetic purposes or as tableware. The principal shapes being produced by Cypriot glass blowers consisted predominantly of jars, beakers and unguentaria, or flasks that contained oil or perfume. Though it is often difficult to distinguish between beakers and jars, the word beaker is mostly used to describe drinking-vessels while jars are considered to be containers for salves and cosmetics.[48] Distinguishing between the two can often be done through examination of the rim of the vessel which would often be unworked if it was not a drinking vessel. Furthermore, jars often had decorated lids that had a design enamelled on the side facing the interior. Among the unguentaria, there were bell-shaped, candlestick, and tubular. As stated before, many held oil or perfume but some think the tubular unguentaria, named tear-bottles by archaeologists, may have contained the tears of relatives or the deceased. Glass was also being used in Cyprus to produce sack-shaped beakers. These are significant as they are only found in Cyprus. This, and the presence of several defective pieces in Cyprus gives further evidence of glass manufacturing in Cyprus.\nCypriot sculptures of the Roman period\nRoman influence can be seen in the use and import of marble as a medium for sculptures, and the display of these sculptures within civic centers and private homes. This use of marble was limited to economically and politically powerful cities located near harbors such as Salamis and Pafos, where there was easier access to imported marble and means to afford and display these statues. It is unknown whether the marble was carved prior to shipment to Cyprus, or if the marble was shipped as blocks and carved on the island. Although marble was a key part of Roman period sculptures on Cyprus, limestone was still being used for sculptures. The use of limestone has been seen to reflect the easy access, and more likely cheaper material from which to carve from, but it has also been viewed as a reflection of Cypriot art style. Limestone may have been a deliberate choice made by the artist, or buyer, to have a Roman style sculpture carve in Cypriot limestone. This is assumed to reflect the idea of a Roman Cyprus, by combining the Roman art style with the Cypriot limestone. The sculptures discovered on the island do not cover the full Roman style, for example togate figures and busts have yet to be found. There are however many Roman-style portraits, statues, and a few reliefs found on the Island (Vessberg and Westholm, 1956). Inscribed bases attest to the existence of bronze sculptures during the Roman period. The one surviving statue is of the emperor Septimius Severus.\nAnother key change to sculptures during the Roman period, was how the Cypriots displayed their work. Cypriots had reserved their sculptures generally to sanctuaries, and were not meant for large public displays. This changed with the Roman period, as Cypriots began to move their sculptures into the public eye, and into large urban areas. This allowed the island to show off the grandeur and splendor of Rome, and to honor the Roman emperors.\nWith the transition to Christianity the older sculptures were modified to reflect Christian values, such as covering or destruction of nudity, or modification of old Greek gods into Christian figures.\nPresently, Salamis is the most important city for Roman period sculptures, but Pafos, Kourion, and Soli are also important archeological sites.\nEarthquakes\nCyprus is located at the boundary between the African and Eurasian plate, an active margin in which the African plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. This collision between two plates is the cause for the large magnitude and frequent earthquakes, especially seen in the southern portion of the Island where a portion of the African plate is thought to be subducting underneath Cyprus. Historically Cyprus has been affected by 16 destructive earthquakes, 7 or higher on the modified Mercalli scale, from 26 B.C. to 1900 A.D. Six earthquakes of note affected Cyprus during the Roman period. In 26 B.C. an earthquake with an intensity of 7 with an epicenter located southwest of Cyprus caused damage in the city of Pafos. In 15 B.C. many towns in Cyprus experienced a magnitude 8 earthquake, but at Pafos and Kourion it registered as a magnitude 9. Its epicentre was southwest of Pafos and it left the city in ruins. Pafos was subsequently rebuilt and renamed Augusta by the Romans. The earthquake of 76 A.D. was among the most destructive earthquakes, with a magnitude between 9 and 10, and it was reported to have created a tsunami. Its epicentre was located southeast of Cyprus. Salamis and Pafos took the brunt of this earthquake, and fell into ruin, with other cities such as Kition and Kourion have been assumed to share the same fate due to magnitude of the earthquake. The destructive nature of the earthquakes can also be recorded in the transfer of Roman mint to Cyprus, as a means to alleviate the island from this disaster. A magnitude 7 earthquake that left Salamis and Pafos in ruins occurred sometime between 332-333 A.D.[54] Its epicenter was located east of the island. In 342 A.D. a magnitude 10 earthquake struck Pafos[53] and Salamis, destroying the cities. It may also have changed the course of some small rivers, as well as causing a series of landslides and fault displacements. The final Roman-period earthquake, a magnitude 7 to 8, occurred in 365 A.D. The south coast of Cyprus was greatly affected by the quake, especially Akrotiri and Kourion. A series of earthquakes following upon the initial quake laid waste to Kourion, and marked the transition into Christianity.\nCities\nNea Pafos (“New Pafos”)\nNea Paphos officially became a city in 312 BC under Nikokles, the last king of the Pafian kingdom. It wasn’t until the second century that the city grew in importance and became the capital of Roman Cyprus. The earliest account of Pafos as the capital of the island actually comes from “The Acts of the Apostles” in the New Testament, where Paul and Barnabas stayed to preach to Sergius Paulus, who then converted to Christianity. Roman Pafos reached its golden age under the Severan Dynasty (and it is attested that there was even an imperial cult to Septimius Severus). Nea Pafos is not to be confused with Palaipafos (“Old Pafos”). However, it is difficult to separate the two, because they were considered to be the same city under Roman rule, and were connected by “a sacred way”. Nea Pafos was the city center, whereas Palaipafos, where the Temple of Aphrodite was, acted as a religious center.\nThe temple of Aphrodite at Palaipafos was one of the most important temples in all of Cyprus. It seems that the importance of this religious festival helped maintain the status of the city throughout the Roman period. It is even said that the emperor Titus visited the Temple of Aphrodite at Pafos on his way to Syria. Once there, Titus was awed by the lavishness of the sanctuary and inquired as to his future endeavors as emperor. The high priest and the goddess Aphrodite herself, supposedly, confirmed the ruler’s favorable future and successful journey to Syria.\nThe temple at Palaipafos was the leading center for the emperor cult. At the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., a statue of the Roman emperor Caracalla was consecrated at Nea Pafos. In the year proceeding, a second statue of the emperor was erected, this time at Palaipafos. Inscriptions at the old city suggest that aside from Aphrodite, only the Roman emperor was worshiped there. Even at the new city, worship was reserved to only a few gods and the emperor. These gods were most likely Zeus Polieus, Aphrodite, Apollo, and Hera. The Sanctuary to Apollo was to the southeast, right outside of the ancient city. It was composed of two underground chambers – a front rectangular one and a back circular one with a dome. This Sanctuary might be contemporary with the foundation of the city. The emperor, on the other hand, was worshiped down to the end of the Severan Dynasty–Septimius Severus—the final emperor who enforced imperial cults.\nImperial cults were not the only way in which Pafos showed its devotion to the empire. In fact, Pafos created a calendar, called either the Imperial or Cypriot calendar, sometime between 21 and 12 BC. This was done to praise Augustus and the Imperial family. It is likely that the calendar was created in 15 BC when the emperor provided funds to rebuild the city after a large earthquake. Although it originated in Pafos, it quickly grew popular and dominated the western and northern areas of Cyprus, and perhaps the southern coast as well. However, it was not the only calendar used throughout the island. The other was the Egyptian calendar used in Salamis, a city who remained loyal to her Egyptian past rather than the empire. Pafos was also given several titles under various emperors. After it was damaged by an earthquake in 15 BC, it received financial aid from the Augustus and the title “Augusta.” The additional name of Flavia, which Pafos bore in Caracalla’s reign (Paphos Augusta Claudia Flavia), was evidently added as a result of the rebuilding of the city under the Flavians after it suffered from another earthquake. It was at this time that the mint was transferred from Syrian Antioch to Pafos. These silver coins, however, were short lived. The city was given the title of “Claudia” in A.D. 66. Pafos was also the favorite city of Cicero, a prominent Roman orator and politician.\nThe Koinon was a confederation of the various Cypriot cities that maintained political and religious power over Cyprus. Acting as a representative body for all of Cyprus’ cities, the Koinon was likely founded at Palaipafos because the Temple of Aphrodite located there hosted a number of religious festivities which attracted Cypriots from all corners of the island. By the end of the Roman period, the Koinon had gained the power to mint its own coins, bestow honorary titles on important individuals (including erecting statues), determine games and other religious events, and even control politics to a degree. It is unclear when the Koinon began to meet at Pafos, though it certainly occurred by the end of the 4th century B.C. Despite this shift in locations, the old city maintained importance as the center for religious activity on Cyprus for centuries after, up until the end of the 4th century A.D., when the Roman emperor Theodosius I outlawed all pagan religions.\nPaphos – Agora\nNea Pafos was located on the western coast of Cyprus, where modern day Kato Paphos now stands. It was among the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest city in Roman Cyprus. The city had walled with towers disposed at regular intervals, and had a harbor (and although it was not of significant size, it was protected by two breakwaters and is still serviceable today). There was also an odeon and a theatre, and two large houses have been excavated. An agora has been found, but only the foundation exists today and excavations are still ongoing. What might have been an acropolis is now covered by a modern-day lighthouse.\nPanoOdeon Paphos\nThe odeon, although damaged by the hands of quarrymen, has been partially restored. It was a semi-circle and consisted of an auditorium and a stage. It was built entirely out of stone and faced the agora; it was destroyed under the earthquakes of the fourth century. The theatre was built as a result of the urbanization of Pafos. It was located on the northeast corner of the town, built against the southern face of a low hill, and positioned so that the audience could look across the town and in the direction of the harbor. It held approximately 8000–8500 people and was one of the few times the entire community came together. The orchestra was in the flat area between the curve of the seating and the stage building. There is very little left of the stage and the stage building today. The use of the theatre ended in the later part of the fourth century, possibly around the earthquake in 365AD. It was excavated by the University of Sydney in 1995 and a series of exploratory trenches were opened by the University of Trier in 1987.\nThe two houses that have been excavated, the House of Theseus and the House of Dionysus, are both large and luxurious houses, another sign that indicates that Pafos was a very wealthy city. The former of the two, the House of Theseus, was a public building that probably belonged to the Roman governor of Cyprus. It was named after a mosaic of Theseus killing a Minotaur that was found in the house and dates to the fourth century. The house is located a short distance from the northwest harbor. The main entrance is to the east and the principal room is in the south wing, along with the baths. Most of the mosaics have been badly damaged and excavations of the house are ongoing.\nHouses of Dionysos Mosaic, Paphos\nThe House of Dionysus, on the other hand, was a private house, probably belonging to a very wealthy citizen. It was given the name because of the frequent appearance of the god on the mosaic floors and dates to the latter half of the second century. On top of the mosaics in the principle rooms, the walls were also decorated with beautiful designs. The bedroom and bathrooms lie in the east wing of the house, whereas the kitchen and workshops lie to the west. Facing the bedrooms to the south is a fish pond “equipped with niches around its bottom in order to serve as a refuge for the fish in hot weather.” Excavations of the house began in 1962.\nHellenistic cemeteries for Palaipafos are found at the south and southwest areas of the city; cemeteries of geometric, archaic, and classical periods found North, East, Southeast of Palaipafos. The “Tombs of the Kings” can be found at the northernmost end of the northern necropolis of Pafos. The tombs themselves are not “royal” but “owe their name to their impressive character.” They date back to the third century BC, but some of the tombs were used in the Early Christian period.\nThe city suffered severely from earthquakes in the fourth century AD. It was around this time, in 346, that the capital was transferred back to Salamis. Cyprus continued to grow and enjoy several prosperities in the 400s and 500s, but Pafos was already in ruins by this point.\nPalaipafos (“Old Pafos”)\nIn Roman Cyprus, Palaipafos was known primarily for the sanctuary to Aphrodite. Palaipafos is located on a limestone hill in southwestern Cyprus, at the mouth of the Diarrhizos river, about one mile inland from the coast. Myth claims that the goddess Aphrodite was born from the sea foam and rose on the rock at the coast called Petra tou Rhomiou. The sanctuary is located a few miles east of the modern Cypriote town of Kouklia, and surrounded, to the west and southwest, by Hellenistic and Roman cemeteries. This sanctuary has one of the longest traditions of cult worship on the island, lasting about 1600 years. Even after the foundation of Nea Pafos in the late 4th century BC, Palaipafos did not lose its significance. It remained a central place of worship in the Mediterranean world and cult worship of Aphrodite continued at this site until the Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I outlawed all pagan worship in 391 AD.\nModern construction in the town of Kouklia has unfortunately obliterated much of the remains at Palaipafos. However, enough remains that Roman built temples can be identified apart from earlier constructions. These buildings are situated on an East/West orientation, and are located in the Northern part of the sanctuary complex. The two buildings, built sometime between the late first and early second century AD, keep to the traditional open court plan for the Paphian cult. It is thought that these were built after the earthquake in 76/77 AD that may have caused some destruction to the sanctuary complex. Reconstructions of the Roman sanctuary show the buildings to surround a rectangular open court, possibly left open on the West side, and enclosed by a South Stoa, an East wing, and a North Hall. The north and south halls are thought to have housed cultic banquets for the goddess. A shrine with an aniconic (non-human form) representation of the goddess Aphrodite was most likely moved from the Old Temple to the new Roman temple. During festivals and celebrations, this conical shaped stone that was a symbol of the fertility goddess was anointed with oils incense were offered. Other religious activities included a procession from the new city to the sanctuary and some form of religious prostitution.\nThe sanctuary to Aphrodite was one of the primary religious centers on Cyprus. The site was famous and attracted visitors from all over the Mediterranean world. There were many Imperial patrons of the sanctuary and a few emperors even visited the temple, including Trajan and Titus. The importance of the sanctuary is what kept Palaipafos on the map after Nea Pafos was founded. There was a paved road from Nea Pafos to Palaipafos that Cypriots would travel in procession for festivals.\nSalamis\nSalamis, located by the modern city of Famagusta, was one of the most important cities on Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean during the reign of the Ptolemies. It represents a shift of centre to the north, which coincided with the opening of the ‘south harbour’ at the southern end of the protecting reef—a harbour which was to remain in commission until the flooding of the entire coast-line, possibly in the 4th century. But Salamis, despite this new harbour, was supplanted by Pafos in the early 2nd century BC as the capital of this island; and this distinction, once lost, was not recovered until AD 346, when the city was re-founded as Constantia.\nAn inscription of the middle Hellenistic date appears to attest to the existence of four gymnasia, which puts Salamis on par with Ephesus and Pergamum. The largest gymnasium, or panegyrikon, which has been excavated, was enlarged during the early Roman Empire by the addition of a bathing establishment and palaestra. Salamis also contained an amphitheatre, also excavated and partially restored, which had a capacity of no less than 15,000 spectators. The amphitheatre, as well as a Roman Bath House, are attributed to the Flavian Ser. Sulpicius Pancles Veranianus. Also discovered at Salamis was a massive temple to Zeus with a ramp constructed in the late Republican or Augustan times and a vast colonnaded agora, which was in use throughout the Roman Imperial period. Salamis, if not the political, remained the industrial capital of the Cyprus, and indeed the most important city on the island.\nIn AD 22, the temple of Zeus Olympius was one of only three temples in all Cyprus to receive confirmation of its right of asylum. However, there are only eight references, Hellenistic and Roman, to Zeus Olympius, and, as compared with the popularity of the Pafian, the god of Salamis was not esteemed by the emperors and their families. Salamis, unlike Pafos, appears to have been ill at ease with Rome and used, down to the days of Epiphanius, the Egyptian rather than the Roman Imperial calendar. But inscriptions which honor Emperors are by no means uncommon. There are honors accorded to Augustus, to Livia and to his adopted sons; to Tiberius, Nero, Vespasian, Hadrian, Plotina, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. There is particular enthusiasm for Hadrian, who came to the aid of Salamis, devastated in AD 116 by the Jewish insurrection of Artemion. Salamis shared in the Severan floruit, which is attested by numerous Severan inscriptions, one of which records the erection of a tethrippon to carry the statues of Septimius Severus, his wife and sons. Also during this time, the orchestra of the theatre was converted into a pool for aquatic games. To the west of the city vast cemeteries extended, but, as compared to Archaic and Classical burial, the Roman tombs are conspicuous for their poverty. The Imperial cult was prominent in Salamis, together with the very erratic incidence of Roman civitas. The city received her water under Nero from the famous spring at Chytri, some 24 miles distant, by rock-cut channel and aqueduct.\nSalamis was destroyed by repeated earthquakes in the middle of the 4th century AD, but was quickly rebuilt as a Christian city by the Emperor of Constantinople, Constantius II—hence its new name, Constantia. This was a much smaller city than it was previously, centered around the harbor and fortified by walls. Some of the pagan public buildings that lay outside the boundaries of the Christian city, such as the gymnasium and even the theatre, were partly rebuilt, the former as baths and the latter to stage mimic productions.\nKourion\nKourion, located on the Southern coast of Cyprus and protected by cliffs on the north and east, was a walled acropolis with a necropolis to the southeast, and a well-preserved stadium and the sanctuary of Apollo Hylates in the west. However, it is said to have made “no palpable impact upon the Roman world of its day”. We know most about this city through the many inscriptions found on the site and through the excavations of two large residences, the House of Achilles Mosaic and the House of the Gladiators.\nInscriptions found in Kourion have been an invaluable source to the study of Kourion. They are important as they tell us about the various building projects conducted in Kourion under the Romans and the involvement of various emperors. They even provide a record of several of the proconsuls in Kourion and their achievements. They give us insight into the Neronian restoration, repairs done to the Hellenistic theatre under Augustus, the remodelling of the theatre into a hunting-theatre under Caracalla, and other important events in the city. Kourion has a fair number of inscriptions on statues of important figures during the Roman period, including Nero, Trajan, and various proconsuls. There are also a few plaques in honour of Caracalla, Septimius Severus, and other important figures. Inscriptions in and around the Sanctuary of Apollo detail the stages of construction and improvements made to the Sanctuary. Several defixiones, or curse tablets, have also been found at Kourion, often targeting other citizens over legal disputes and of a sufficient quantity to distinguish Kourion from other sites. Several funerary inscriptions left by relatives of the dead were also found although these were not particularly common in Kourion.\nThe Sanctuary of Apollo, located approximately 1.5 km (1 mi) west of Kourion[70] was a significant feature of the city, being described as the most impressive cult-centre in Cyprus. It is thought to have been built around 65 or 66 AD, during the reign of Nero and would have undoubtedly been destroyed by the massive earthquake of 365 AD. It was first discovered and excavated by Louis Cesnola, whose account of the site proved invaluable as it was later plundered and devastated by stone-seekers. Though Cesnola mentions the presence of columns in his account, none were found by later excavators. The temple would later be rediscovered by George McFadden, whose greatest impact regarding the study of the sanctuary of Apollo was his discovery that the temple had two phases, one Hellenistic and the other Roman. However, the most significant contributor to the study of this temple would have to be Robert Scranton who made many notable findings. It was he who suggested that the temple was never completely rebuilt but instead had its front remodelled, interior divided, and floor level raised under the Romans. Though there is still some debate regarding the exact dating of the temple, many believe it to have been constructed during the reign of Nero. This is supported by the fact that the Neronian period was a time of relative prosperity in Kourion as attested to by the fact that the Theater of Kourion was rebuilt around 64 or 65 AD, only a year or two before the construction of the temple.[70] Overall, it seems that the temple was modernised under the Romans but no dramatic changes appear to have been made. Flowing water (provided to the temple and the city during the reign of Claudius) and a tighter organization of the space constitute two examples of Roman modernisation of the temple. The temple also seems to have had strong Near Eastern connections, evidenced by coins, architecture, and pottery. Because of Kourion’s association of Trajan as Apollo Caesar with Apollo Hylates, he contributed to the building of several structures including the Curium Gate, SE Building, the Bath House, S Building, and the NW Building, as indicated by inscriptions bearing his name.[69] However, after his death worship of Apollo Caesar ended.\nThe House of the Achilles Mosaic, with its open courtyard surrounded by rooms on both sides and colonnaded portico to the northeast, was dated to approximately the first half of the fourth century AD and is most notable for the large mosaic depicting the famous Greek myth in which Odysseus, by sounding a false alarm, was able to fool Achilles, then disguised as a woman, to reveal his true identity, thus bringing about his participation in the Trojan War which is famously described in Homer’s Iliad. The building had mosaic floors, one of which, although damaged, seems to portray the Trojan prince Ganymede being abducted by Zeus.[71]\nMore is known about the other famous residence, the House of the Gladiators, which was located in close proximity to the city wall and several meters east of the House of Achilles, seems to have been the residence of a fairly affluent patrician. This house is dated to the second half of the third century AD, apparently having been built prior to the House of Achilles. It consisted of a central courtyard with corridors lining all four walls. The rooms open directly into these corridors. The floor was once covered with mosaics, with cisterns underground to collect rainwater. The house unfortunately did not escape the devastating earthquake of 365 AD unscathed. The walls, roof, and mosaics were all severely damaged. Located in the central courtyard is a mosaic, remarkably preserved, depicting a gladiatorial combat scene, This is significant as such scenes were extremely rare in Cyprus. Only two of the three panels depicting this scene survive unfortunately.\nThe theater, which was built in the northern part of the acropolis and excavated by the Pennsylvania University Museum from 1949 to 1950, was renovated under Roman rule sometime around 100 AD and once more around 200 AD. Though the auditorium was originally a fully formed circle, under the Romans it was reduced to a half-circle. Around the second century AD it was enlarged to its current size and several buttresses were added to support it. Around 200 AD, it was remodeled to accommodate hunting and gladiatorial games, only to later be converted back into a traditional theater around 300 AD. It is thought to have accommodated somewhere around 3500 spectators. The theater appears to have been abandoned sometime during the fourth century. It still stands today but suffered much from stone-seekers.\nThe stadium, also excavated by the Pennsylvania University Museum, was located in the northwestern region of Kourion with its U-shaped foundation and three entrance gates still standing today and remarkably preserved. It is thought to have been built around the 2nd century AD under the Antonine emperors and remained in use until around 400 AD. It likely accommodated around 6,000 spectators and consisted of a long oval race track for runners and chariot races. An account can be found of its last race and destruction, provided by a Cypriote writing a fictional account of the Life of St. Barnabas in the fifth century.\nThe necropolis was excavated by Cesnola in 1876, and then more reliably under George McFadden who dug 95 pits and uncovered 9 tombs, only one of which he published. This tomb, named Tomb 8, was likely constructed in the third century BC and used up until the first century AD. The other unpublished tombs also seemed to have had similarly extended periods of use. The knowledge regarding Kourion’s tombs is not at this point extensive. We only know that they were “extremely large and elaborate”. However, they are certainly worth further study. Tombs are significant sources of information as they are crucial in determining burial practice and are often rich in pottery and other grave goods which can be fairly well preserved.\nThe fall of Roman Kourion can be attributed to the massive earthquake that occurred on April 21, 365 AD. Based on the descriptions of the quake, it appears to have caused a tsunami and has been tentatively given the measurement of 11, other sources state a magnitude 10,[74] on the Modified Mercalli scale of 0 to 12, with 12 indicating total destruction. This earthquake marks the end of antiquity and the start of the Middle Ages as well as the transition to Christianity.\nKition (Citium)\nThe ancient city of Kition is completely overlaid by the modern city of Larnaka, and is therefore largely unexcavated. It possessed an acropolis at Bamboula; to the southeast of the acropolis lay a large natural harbor, which has since silted in. It was very important in trade as a port city and the administration changed hands many times in its history, notably by the Phoenicians prior to the Roman administration. Even under the rule of the Romans, aspects of the old city life remained. For example, the cult of Eshmun continued into the Augustan age through a transition to the worship of Asclepius. Kition not specific about using its own name, and was often referred to as simple “the city”. (“e polis” or “o demos”), which was reflective of its old Phoenician name. There is an abundance of inscriptions in Kition, especially funerary inscriptions, many of which show influences of other cultures, such as Semitic names that have been Hellenized. However, Imperial influence is still apparent in the finding of two statues to the emperor Nerva.\nThree small areas of the site have been excavated at the present; it was first excavated by the Swedish Cyprus expedition in 1929; second, by Vassos Karageorghis in 1976; and most recently by Marguerite Yon in 1985.\nArsinoe\nArsinoe (immediately north of the modern city of Polis) was founded in 270 B.C. and continued with varying levels of prosperity into the Roman times and so it is well recorded by the geographers of the Roman period as being an important regional city. Arsinoe’s importance depended on its proximity to the south Anatolian coast and the Aegean for trade as well as being a major center of exportation for the Imperial copper mines at Limni through the natural harbor at the site. However, Arsinoe’s civic importance in the Roman world is attested to the mile-markers found in the region, which were measured in distance from the city. A Roman theatre and a gymnasium from the Ptolemaic period are the only major ruins left at the site. However Strabo, the Greek geographer, tells about a sanctuary to Zeus and Aphrodite a short distance outside the Roman city. Although there are a few archaeological remains, there is a surprising lack of epigraphical evidence for a city that played such an important role in Roman Cyprus. In the past there have been no major excavations done at the site except for a survey in 1960 conducted by the Cyprus Department of Antiquities. Recent excavations undertaken by Princeton University are still ongoing but a preliminary exhibition of the artifacts found at Arsinoe is available at the Princeton Art Museum.\nMinor cities\nAmathus\nThe ancient city of Amathus, near modern-day Limassol (village of Ag. Tychonas) was a city of importance before Roman rule. After Nea Pafos was established as the center of Roman administration on Cyprus, Amathus began to decline. Only the granting of asylum for the sanctuary of Aphrodite by the senate in 22 AD preserved its existence. The city remained unexcavated until 1975, when Pierre Aupert and the French School at Athens discovered remains on the acropolis, including the temple to Ahprodite, a Christian basilica, palace storerooms, and explored the port. The temple of Aphrodite was renovated in the first or second century AD to combine both Greek and Near Eastern architectural styles. The new structure included a pronaos, a cella, and an adyton. Systematic destruction of the building by later inhabitants makes any further detail for the interior of the structure unidentifiable. The excavator also cannot determine if there was a cult statue housed in the temple. One distinct feature is the style of capitals used on the columns. They are Nabataean style, which is thought to have originated in Egypt. Unlike the sanctuary to Aphrodite in Palaipafos, pilgrims did not visit the temple in Amathus. In addition to the temple on the acropolis, remains of a typical Roman style bath house were found. A vast necropolis surrounds the city, the south being largely Hellenistic and Roman burials, and the east being strictly Imperial burials. Hundreds of cippi were found widespread throughout the city that suggest “a vigorous village life, seemingly less dependent on the polis then elsewhere in Cyprus.”. Other structures that have been attested to, but not yet discovered, in Amathus are the temple to Hera and the temple to the mysterious Seven within the Stelae.\nCarpasia\nCarpasia, near modern Rizokarpasso, remains mostly unexcavated. The site itself consists of about 3 square kilometers on the Karpaz Peninsula next to a natural harbor. The remains of walls which surrounded the entirety of the city can still be seen. An aqueduct, built in Roman times, brought water to the city from natural springs. The remains of columns suggest the presence of a temple near the city’s harbor. The chief deity of the Karpaz Peninsula was Aphrodite Acraea, whose temple was located at the tip of Cape Andreas, and farmlands near modern Rizokarpasso were dedicated to the goddess. Carpasia is mentioned by historians in the Classical era, and in inscriptions dating to the Julio-Claudian and Hadrianic eras.\nCeryneia\nCeryneia, now overlaid by modern-day Kyrenia, was a port city on the northern coast of Cyprus. There is much evidence for the ancient city but epigraphic and archaeological evidence from the Roman era is inconclusive. Although it remains unexcavated, the ancient harbor still stands and occasional finds are made and reported. Three inscription were found that dated the city to the Roman time period; an oath of allegiance to Tiberius the “Apollo of Ceryneia,” a dedication to the “demos of Ceryneia” on a statue, and one mentioning the construction of a water-system during Claudius’ reign.\nChytri\nChytri (east of modern Kythrea) was one of only two inland cities on Roman Cyprus (the other was Tamassus). Chytri’s most important topographical feature — and the reason for its continued existence — is its bounteous spring. The site has not been excavated, though an acropolis and extensive cemetery have been identified. Geographers and a single inscription attest to Chytri’s independence during the Roman period. Inscriptions indicate a close relationship with Salamis, Chytri’s most convenient access to the Mediterranean. Salamis, on the other hand, valued access to Chytri’s springwater and under Nero a rock-cut channel and aqueduct was built to bring water to the coastal site. By the time of Caracalla, Chytri may have been subordinate to Salamis.

It was most famous for its copper and earthenware processing, though it was an important commercial site regardless. Copious springs nearby provided the city with a constant supply of freshwater. Remains of the harbor’s breakwater and city walls are still visible today, though no other ancient structures can be identified. The city had long been Phoenician in culture, and maintained Semitic speech for a long period of time before Hellenization kicked in. Although the site still remains unexcavated (due to its location in the north), the few inscriptions that originated from this area indicate that the city was extremely important from an economical standpoint; so much so, in fact, that Ptolemy says that it is one of the four conventi that divided the island. Neither temples nor theatres can be found at the site, but it is obvious that the city was accepting of Roman influence because of inscriptions suggesting a gymnasium where the Actaean games were performed in honor of Augustus’ victory. Other inscriptions suggest statues of Augustus, Tiberius, Trajan, and Hadrian within the city walls. It is also important to note that the consular of the island during the mid third century, Cl. Leontichus Illyrius, is the first example of Imperial distinction bestowed upon a family native to the island of Cyprus.[20][21]\nSoli\nSoli was the most important city of North-Western Cyprus and the ruins cover a wide area with a low hill that supported the acropolis that is coved by a modern village. This city had great importance to agriculture on the Morphau plain the copper mines in Skouriotissa. The acropolis boasted a large cavea that can hold up to 3500 spectators. The most impressive feature of the site was the broad paved and colonnaded street that ran from east to west across the city. There was also an excavated temple to an unidentified deity as well as an attested gymnasium and temple of Zeus that was once at the site. Statues of important Roman figures such as Emperor Trajan and Marcus Aurelius were erected at the site as well as dedications to Nero, Augustus, and Trajan. The city had great economic importance in Roman Cyprus due to the attested presence of a curator civitatis and a public records office.\nTamassos\nTamassos (covered in part by modern Politiko) is an extensive and unexcavated site named in the 2nd century B.C. The major topographical features is an outline of the walls to the city, a probable acropolis, and necropolis. The evidence for civic status of the city is determined from geographers. Under Roman rule cities and villages located in the hinterland with no viable economic assets tended to decay, however the copper mine of Tamassos allowed the city to maintain itself, albeit only modestly as seen in only one valuable funerary inscription was found. The mine was Tamassos was the most important aspect of the city, with the copper transported to the port of Soli for trade.\nChronological timeline\n- 80-58 BC Reign of King Ptolemy of Cyprus\n- 58 BC Cato the Younger implemented the Lex Clodia de Cyprus making Cyprus part of the Roman province of Cilicia; Cato was proconsul of Cyprus from 58-56 BC\n- 52-51 BC M.

In an internal memo to staff, the bank said the move would affect 15 branches, which will be announced in the coming days. “The move reflects the networks rationalisation course, bolstering the branches that are most convenient to customers, but also reducing the most tedious elements of our daily life,” the memo said. The move will also cut operating cost, but no jobs will be lost at this stage.\n“It is expected that transfers will take place,” the memo said. “Affected colleagues will be moved to other branches and roles, depending on their circumstances and the bank’s needs.”\nBoC said over the counter service is decreasing, as more and more people do their business through digital channels. Some 75 per cent of the bank’s transactions are carried out through digital channels and the rate is even higher among private citizens, 83 per cent. Nine in 10 withdrawals are done at ATMs and loan applications through the lender’s site are seeing a daily rise.\nNinety-two per cent of money transfers are also done online. BoC is simply following the same path other lenders have across the globe, dictated by consumers who want simpler, faster, and cheaper service, the memo said. The lender will continue to be the largest and most important bank in Cyprus, irrespective of the number of branches, since it will hold the largest market share in loans, deposits, plastic money, and so on, the memo added.\nCOMMENT\nThey don’t deserve to still be around, they played God with depositor’s money, then they plundered their customer’s accounts….they have no credibility as a financial institution and the people in authority who oversaw this have no credibility as leaders. Cyprus has a massively overpopulated civil service, which is paid for by stealing from people who actually generate taxable income, unions have a stranglehold on corporations, which means more will end up like Cyprus Airways if nothing is done……soon!\nIt’s time to get real, Cyprus is no longer a closed market, there may be many obstacles which normally only hinder Cypriots, but one by one, forcing companies, with more stringent performance demands on their personnel are taking more of the market in many sectors….the days of getting a job and forcing people to pay you even though you do not deserve it are OVER!\nThey cannot run a country with everything set up to feed people who have no right to be in the equation. If you want to form a limited company in the UK, you get on line, pay a small fee and the next day you download your certificate of incorporation, in Cyprus, you have to pay a solicitor, it costs a fortune, you are obliged to have an accountant.\nNow they have decided to impose illegal penalties on imported used cars, it is part of the EU, but they act as though they are a law unto themselves. There are too many people in the civil service who do not deserve to be there, (you may have read my previous article about education) and they are being paid for by taking more and more from productive people, the bureaucracy is beyond belief.\nI don’t think people realise that civil servants DO NOT PAY TAX in real terms, returning a portion to the pot where it came from is not payong tax. The only way is to support small businesses, even income tax is antiquated, VAT is unfair as it could be seen as a poor man’s tax (the poor are normally at the bottom of the proverbial food chain and invariably they cannot claim VAT back) the fairest way is a sales tax.\nI did some rough calculations based on data from the National statistics register, a non-refundable sales tax, would only need to be 3 or 4% to net the same revenue as VAT and basic rate income tax combined….every single sale would generate real revenue and it would apply to everyone, because offshore companies could not siphon off profits, if they sell here, they pay here, end of.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_ed-miliband-poised-to-unleash-wind-power-revolution-across-british-countryside/content_1222.html": "Ed Miliband Poised to Unleash Wind Power Revolution Across British Countryside\nLabour’s shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, stands on the precipice of reigniting a contentious debate that has lain dormant for nearly a decade. The imminent resurgence of onshore wind turbines in Britain’s picturesque landscapes looms large on the horizon, threatening to reignite passions and divide communities once more.\nA decade has passed since the rural backlash that compelled David Cameron’s government to halt onshore wind developments. Now, Miliband is gearing up to wage a new campaign in the shires, one that could dramatically alter the face of rural Britain.\nShould Labour emerge victorious in the forthcoming general election, as many political pundits predict, Miliband’s ascension to the role of energy secretary would herald a sea change in the nation’s approach to renewable energy. Among his first acts in office would be a comprehensive rewrite of the planning regulations that have hitherto stymied wind farm developments across England.\nAt a recent gathering of wind farm developers, Miliband articulated his vision with striking clarity: “Our mission involves doubling onshore wind, trebling solar, quadrupling offshore wind and backing hydrogen CCS [carbon capture and storage], nuclear and other clean energy technologies,” he declared. “We need all of these technologies…That’s why we would get started in our first weeks in office by overturning the Conservative onshore wind ban in England.”\nIn a political climate where Labour has faced criticism for a perceived lack of clarity regarding its policy agenda, Miliband’s forthright approach might be viewed as a refreshing departure from ambiguity. However, for many residents in rural areas that have hitherto been shielded by Mr Cameron’s moratorium on onshore wind development, Miliband’s pledge will likely be interpreted as an ominous harbinger of unwelcome change.\nSir Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader, offered a glimpse into the party’s ambitious plans during his address at last year’s Labour conference. He characterised Britain’s current planning system as “one barrier so big, so imposing that it blocks out all light from the other side” and vowed to “bulldoze through it.” This robust rhetoric signals a comprehensive overhaul of planning regulations, aimed at promoting development and growth across the board, with a particular emphasis on facilitating onshore wind projects.\nThe implications of this policy shift are profound. Wind turbines may soon punctuate some of Britain’s most cherished landscapes, accompanied by a proliferation of electricity pylons, solar farms, battery storage facilities, and an array of other low-carbon energy infrastructure. This transformation of the rural vista is poised to spark intense debate and, potentially, fierce opposition.\nProponents of the policy argue that such measures are long overdue. A recent analysis conducted by Friends of the Earth suggested that removing planning obstacles for onshore wind and solar projects could catalyse a staggering 13-fold increase in electricity generation from these sources. The environmental group identified 219,800 hectares of land deemed suitable for onshore wind development, contending that this represents a mere fraction of the UK’s total land area.\nJames Robottom, head of policy at Renewable UK, an industry body, lends his support to the initiative: “Lifting the ban on onshore wind in England would give local authorities a powerful tool to strengthen our nation’s energy security,” he asserts.\nHowever, critics are quick to point out that the area identified for potential wind farm development, while small in relative terms, still exceeds the size of Herefordshire. Moreover, they argue that the physical footprint of the turbines themselves is not the crux of the issue.\nThe next generation of wind turbines, characterised by their colossal dimensions, are set to exert a profound impact on the wider landscape, even if the individual towers occupy a comparatively modest land area. The ceaseless rotation of their blades inevitably draws the eye, potentially disrupting once-tranquil vistas. Additionally, concerns persist regarding the generation of vibrations and light “flicker” for nearby residents. These were precisely the arguments that fuelled protests a decade ago, ultimately compelling Cameron’s government to reverse course on onshore wind development.\nThe scale of Labour’s ambition becomes apparent when considering Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to more than double onshore wind capacity from the current 15 gigawatts (GW) to 35GW by 2030. At present, England is home to 2,009 onshore wind turbines, with Scotland boasting nearly 5,000 and Wales hosting approximately 1,000 more, bringing the UK total to around 8,000.\nHowever, the majority of these existing turbines are diminutive by modern standards, particularly when compared to their offshore counterparts. Most stand between 200 and 300 feet tall and generate less than a megawatt of power each. The next wave of turbines promises to be markedly different – towering behemoths reaching heights of up to 850 feet, each capable of producing significantly more electricity.\nThe sheer scale of these planned machines does mean that fewer will be required to meet Labour’s 2030 target – approximately 4,000 such turbines could suffice. Paradoxically, the majority of these are likely to be erected in England, as the longstanding ban means it retains the most promising undeveloped sites.\nThe pressing questions that arise are: Where will these turbines be constructed? And at what cost to wildlife and the landscape?\nTo gain insight into the potential impact, one need look no further than Wales, where the devolved government has already implemented planning law reforms similar to those proposed by Mr Miliband. The “Future Wales – the National Plan 2040” outlines three crucial alterations to the planning regime.\nFirstly, decision-making authority for larger wind farms has been wrested from local councils and placed in the hands of Labour ministers. Secondly, a “presumption in favour of large-scale wind energy developments” has been introduced, paving the way for more numerous and taller turbines – up to 850 feet in height. Previously, such massive structures were exclusively deployed offshore.\nThe consequences of these changes have been swift and significant. Applications for wind farm developments have surged, as have the number of protest groups springing up in towns and villages across Wales, from Anglesey in the north to Powys in the south. Each of these groups is engaged in its own battle against what they perceive as an invasion of turbines into their local landscapes.\nThere is a very real possibility that these conflicts could soon be replicated across England. Mark Sullivan, chairman of the West Midlands group of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, offers a sobering perspective: “It’s worth remembering that the current policy is not a ban. Developers who obtain community support can get permission for turbines. It is just that people living in rural England will not give that support.”\nThe debate extends beyond mere aesthetic considerations. The construction of wind farms necessitates the installation of foundations, the laying of cables, the building of substations, and often the creation of new access roads. Once operational, turbines can cause further disruption through “flicker” – caused by sunlight reflected off moving blades – and low-level vibrations transmitted through both air and ground.\nMoreover, it is not only human residents who stand to be affected by this renewable energy revolution. The British Trust for Ornithology, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), and various Wildlife Trusts all express support for clean energy in principle. However, they caution that poorly-sited turbines can drive birds and bats away from their habitats and disrupt delicate ecosystems. These organisations have called for comprehensive ecological impact assessments to be conducted “at the very start of the planning process”.\nThe Welsh government’s response to these concerns has been to implement a zoning system, creating “Pre-Assessed Areas for Wind Energy”. This approach effectively designates vast swathes of the Welsh countryside as suitable for wind farm development, irrespective of local sentiment.\nIn anticipation of Mr Miliband’s promised changes to planning law, local authorities across England have already begun incorporating wind development areas into their local plans. Northumberland County Council, for instance, has published a detailed 47-page guide identifying the most suitable areas for new wind farms within its jurisdiction.\nFor the time being, Mr Miliband is refraining from explicitly endorsing such zoning measures, suggesting that it may be premature to delve into such specifics. Nevertheless, his determination to facilitate the construction of these wind farms is unequivocal.\n“We just want to lift this ban,” he states emphatically. “At the moment, it’s easier to build an incinerator than it is to have an onshore wind development. And that doesn’t make any sense.”\nAs the debate intensifies and the prospect of a Labour government looms larger, communities across rural England find themselves bracing for a potential transformation of their local landscapes. The coming months and years are likely to witness a clash between the imperatives of renewable energy development and the desire to preserve the character of Britain’s countryside. The outcome of this conflict will shape the nation’s energy future and the face of its rural landscapes for generations to come.",

Sometimes its actually quite easy to overlook such symptoms and not be able to help ones self or others who are suffering from depression for that matter.\nThere are actually a lot of symptoms of depression that depressed people may actually posses but they dont have to suffer from each and every one of them before you actually help them get diagnosed and be treated for this illness. Also, since symptoms of depression actually vary, the time of their “attacks” varies as well.\nHere are some common examples of symptoms of depression:\nProlonged period of sadness or not feeling “up to it,” people who are always feeling not in the mood, whod rather mope around the house and feel sorry for ones self is the best example for this symptom of depression.\nFeels hopeless, perennial pessimist: speaking of feeling sorry for ones self, another common symptom of depression is when a person actually feels like he/she has nothing to look forward to in his or her life. As for being the perennial pessimist, those who show this symptom of depression are usually very negative about things, again, the feeling of hopelessness comes in to mind.\nGuilt-driven, loss of self-worth and helplessness: other symptoms of depression that can be easily seen on people who prefer to mope around all day long are these. Whenever a person feels so guilty over something, that actually makes one a very sad person who feels like he or she doesnt deserve to be happy. Thus, the loss of self-worth, if that person feels like he or she isnt worthy of being happy or enjoying ones self then thats clear tell-tale symptom of depression. Helplessness also contribute to being depressed, when assuming that things wont simply go your way, its already a clear saying that you have absolutely no hope in your body at all.\nIsnt interested in finding or taking pleasure; just dropping the hobbies as well as the other things that one used to enjoy: this tell-tale symptom of depression just shows how depressed a person can be, if one is actually too sad to take pleasure even in the very things that one loves then that person is seriously lacking something, rather, that person might well have caught the depression bug.\nFatigue, always tired: people suffering from depression, since theyve lost whatever interest in life that they may have had before are actually lacking of physical energy at all times, if one would prefer to just mope around, probably wont even eat not get enough sleep, a depressed person may well be on their way to not just a mental illness but depression can actually be terrible for ones physical health as well.\nHaving trouble concentrating, having bad memory and is indecisive: a person who is suffering from depression easily gives away this tell-tale symptom of depression. Wherein ones lack of interest with regards to the outside world or for just about anything for that matter can lead to that persons inability to lose track of things and actually not be able to remember things that happened or what other people said. Lack of interest actually makes depressed people very inattentive.\nThere are actually more symptoms of depression that can actually help you see if a person (or you) needs to be brought to the doctor to get some help when it comes to depression: lacking sleep, sleeping too much or waking up at wee hours of the morning are all symptoms of depression (if it happens on a daily basis), appetite loss as well as eating too much may show ones lack of enthusiasm for life. Be weary of sudden weight loss or weight gain in those around you. Being suicidal, talking about death, about wanting to die is another clear indication that that person is depressed. Being restless and irritable and physical symptoms that are usually brought about by poor mental health such as headaches, digestive disorders and various body pains.",

Today, we find ourselves revisiting the issue of NHS reforms that were promised years ago but never quite materialized. Will history repeat itself, or can the government muster the courage to forge a new path? Steve Barclay, the Health Secretary, speaks up in an exclusive interview, shedding light on his vision for the future of healthcare in the UK. One key element of this vision? Direct referrals for cancer patients to specialists, bypassing the traditional GP route. Additionally, diagnostic centers would be established to facilitate tests, removing the need for an intermediary GP visit.\nThe notion of streamlining healthcare access and delivery is not a new one. Cast your mind back to 2008 when a similar concept was initially floated by the Labour government under the stewardship of health minister Ara Darzi. In his ambitious review of primary care services, Darzi proposed the establishment of polyclinics—a concept that would bring together both general practitioners and specialists under one roof. This model, already operational on the Continent, aims to seamlessly connect diagnosis with early intervention—a strategy that has proven successful in healthcare systems worldwide, yielding notably improved outcomes, particularly in cancer treatment and recovery.\nThe principles underlying this innovative approach align harmoniously with the broader trajectory of global healthcare. However, despite its potential benefits, the proposed polyclinic model faced significant opposition from the British Medical Association (BMA) at the time. Concerns were raised about potential compromises in the quality of general practice, disruptions to the vital GP-patient relationship, compromised continuity of care, increased travel time, additional costs, governance issues, and doubts about whether investing in existing services might yield better results.\nPilot schemes were launched in London to test the feasibility of the polyclinic concept. Yet, like a promising flower nipped in the bud, the idea met its untimely end due to a vehement campaign led by the BMA and a lack of political appetite to challenge the status quo. Reflecting on this episode, we gain a sobering insight into the state of the NHS—an institution grappling with deep-seated challenges that have persisted over a decade and a half.\nAs we find ourselves embroiled once more in the same discourse, it begs the question: Can history be rewritten this time around? Can the cycle of promises and disappointments be broken? The answer, it seems, rests in the hands of individuals like Steve Barclay, who dare to challenge vested interests that have become entrenched within the primary care system.\nThe looming question is whether Barclay’s proposed reforms can withstand the formidable forces of opposition. Will they succeed where previous initiatives faltered? Will the benefits of direct referrals and diagnostic centers for cancer patients finally see the light of day? The success of such reforms hinges on the government’s readiness to confront the vested interests that have, time and again, thwarted progress.\nAs we navigate this complex terrain of healthcare reform, we’re left with an important lesson: Change in healthcare requires not only innovative ideas but also the courage to challenge convention, confront vested interests, and forge ahead with determination. Only then can we hope to unlock a healthier future for the NHS and its millions of beneficiaries. The time for reform is now, and the question remains—will we seize the opportunity to break the cycle and pave a new way forward?",

No!\nThey were in there in fact because one of the young lady’s mother has Spina Bifida, yet they have cut her benefits, leaving her unable to keep warm or eat.\nAnyone think this is NOT a reason to protest?\nFor those who have never attended, the media is happy to portray these young people as ‘ANARCHISTS’ however, after attending and speaking to many of the people there, they are just angry young people, frustrated with modern society.\nAs I followed the march around, I noticed that the police had several officers out armed with video recording equipment, they were ensuring that they had EVERYONE on camera. Later in the evening, they insisted that everyone wearing a mask, took it off so they could film them, those who did not comply, were threatened with arrest.\nWhile this may seem a legitimate request to target anarchists, those were actually few and far between and not only that, they were arrested and therefore, the police would know EXACTLY who they were. No, this video surveillance is for a far more sinister purpose, it ensures that any emerging political threat can be monitored in advance!\nAgree or disagree, they have and should ALWAYS have the right to voice their concerns, we may not be aware of it, but they represent the last bastion of resistance to the forthcoming totalitarian state!\nThere is a war on for your mind!",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-shocking-reality-of-excess-deaths-in-england/content_303.html": "The Shocking Reality of Excess Deaths in England\nIn a December 2022 report published in The Lancet, concerning statistics reveal that England is experiencing an unprecedented rise in excess deaths, especially among young and middle-aged adults. The silence around this data is deafening.\nWhat Are Excess Deaths?\nExcess deaths refer to the number of deaths above and beyond what would normally be expected based on historical data. For example, if 3,000 people died per week on average over the past five years, but suddenly 3,500 people are dying per week, those extra 500 deaths would be considered “excess deaths.”\nMultiple reputable agencies and statistical analyses all point to the same finding – excess deaths in England in 2022 and early 2023 are substantially higher than normal across every demographic. And excess deaths are rising at an alarming rate compared to pre-pandemic years going back as far as 1940.\nSomething strange is happening to cause more people to die than experts anticipate, and the elephant in the room is that none of the suspected causes put forth have been properly investigated or explained.\nKey Details on the Excess Deaths\nThe Lancet report highlights several noteworthy data points regarding these unexplained excess deaths in England:\n1. The excess deaths are not isolated to the elderly population as might be assumed. Actually, the rise in excess deaths is markedly higher among younger adults aged 25-49 (11% higher than expected) and those aged 50-64 (15% higher).\n2. Cardiovascular diseases account for a large share of the excess deaths, with a 12% rise above expectations from all causes. Specifically, heart failure deaths are up 20% and overall cardiovascular conditions make up 47% of the total excess deaths.\n3. When you combine age group and cause of death, the statistics become even more striking. Excess deaths from heart conditions for adults aged 50-64 are a shocking 44% higher than normal.\n4. Up to 22% more people are dying at home rather than in hospitals or hospices. This suggests many people are unaware of an underlying illness or health crisis brewing inside them.\nThe Cone of Silence Surrounding Excess Deaths\nDespite reporting that comes directly from The Lancet journal and has data solid enough to warrant major headlines, this story is not being picked up by any mainstream media outlets. This cone of silence around the reality of excess deaths likely means an intentional effort is underway to suppress this information.\nI have insider experience working for major UK media organizations like the Mail Online, The Sun, Fox News and the BBC that would normally leap at shocking statistics to drive clicks and engagement. Yet there is coordinated silence on this data.\nThe sheer magnitude of excess deaths, the anomalous age brackets affected, the lack of explanations, and the deliberate media avoidance of this topic all point to an urgent crisis that demands answers.\nWhat Experts and Citizens Must Do Now\nRegardless of one’s opinion on COVID vaccines, pandemic response measures, or overall health authority competency, the excess death statistics published in The Lancet must become part of an open and urgent public health conversation.\nFor experts and health authorities, it is imperative to investigate every potential cause and provide explanations to the public. Even if reasonable answers are found that have nothing to do with vaccines, transparency and proactive information will reassure a population with growing health worries.\nCitizens should inform themselves on this data, ask questions, and request more details. Do not allow the cone of silence around excess deaths to enable inaction. Leaders must be held accountable for investigating and reporting on this crisis with urgency and compassion for those looking for life-saving answers.\nThe responsibility now lies with health authorities and media outlets to engage in honest conversations about post-pandemic excess deaths. United Kingdom residents deserve facts, research, and health guidance instead of secrecy and evasion. Without open and swift action led by data instead of agendas, the tragic rise of excess deaths haunting England may continue unabated.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-growing-strain-of-council-tax-a-call-for-relief/content_1000.html": "The Growing Strain of Council Tax – A Call for Relief\nIn a concerning revelation, new data from the TaxPayers’ Alliance has shed light on the escalating burden of council tax across the UK. The analysis paints a stark picture, with some local authorities imposing a hefty ten per cent charge on citizens’ salaries. This financial strain has doubled in relation to median earnings since the inception of council tax, prompting calls for an urgent freeze on rates to provide households with the much-needed breathing room they deserve.\n**Divergent Burdens Across the Nation**\nThe TaxPayers’ Alliance report exposes a glaring disparity in council tax burdens across the UK. The North East emerges as the region with the highest council tax burden, accounting for a staggering 8.66 per cent of median earnings. Meanwhile, Scotland boasts the lowest council tax relative to median gross pay at 5.1 per cent, closely followed by London at 5.42 per cent.\nThe alliance labels this escalating tax as an “unsustainable burden” that’s particularly impactful for already-strained households. In response, they’re advocating for a freeze on council tax rates in the upcoming year.\n**Unveiling the Extremes**\nThe data highlights local authorities where the council tax burden is as alarming as it is oppressive. West Devon takes the lead, with Band D council tax reaching a staggering £2,347, equating to an astonishing 10.85 per cent of median gross pay. Not far behind is Torridge in north-west Devon, also charging over 10 per cent of the median salary for council tax.\nThe report also pinpoints Nottingham and Pendle in Lancashire as additional areas where council tax surpasses the 10 per cent threshold of regional median earnings. In stark contrast, Wandsworth in southwest London boasts the lowest burden, with residents only paying 2.16 per cent of their median gross pay towards the levy.\n**An Unrelenting Rise over Time**\nWhile council tax is traditionally tied to property values, the analysis underscores a disturbing trend. Payments have surged in relation to both income and property prices. In England, the TaxPayers’ Alliance notes an alarming 79 per cent rise in real terms over the past three decades.\nFurthermore, on a national scale, the burden of council tax relative to median average earnings has surged by a staggering 108 per cent since its introduction in 1993 up until 2022. This escalation has taken a disproportionately heavy toll on areas with lower house prices, with London residents paradoxically facing the lowest average council tax bills despite having the highest property prices.\n**Urgent Calls for Reform**\nThe growing chorus of concern has found a resonant voice in Craig Mackinlay, the Tory MP for South Thanet. He asserts that council tax is becoming an increasing burden on taxpayers’ net income, with limited deterrents for town halls from raising the annual tax. A freeze, he argues, would be both simple and welcomed.\nMackinlay doesn’t stop at a mere freeze; he calls for comprehensive reform within the broader tax framework for local authorities. He emphasizes the need for innovative solutions from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) to address the escalating issue.\n**Seeking Relief for Struggling Taxpayers**\nA disconcerting statistic revealed by the TaxPayers’ Alliance underscores the pressing need for action. Over the past two decades, there have been a staggering 9,462 individual council tax increases, with a mere 404 freezes and 393 cuts. This stark asymmetry speaks volumes about the prevailing trend.\nJohn O’Connell, representing the TaxPayers’ Alliance, encapsulates the situation aptly: “Taxpayers are struggling with the unsustainable burden of council tax. But far from falling on those with the broadest shoulders, it appears that the most hard-pressed households are bearing the brunt of rising rates.” With a plea for fairness and consideration, he adds, “The least local authorities can do is freeze council tax next year to give residents much-needed breathing space.”\nIn conclusion, the looming specter of an increasingly onerous council tax burden calls for immediate attention and action. As families across the nation grapple with rising living costs, the need for relief has never been more urgent. The call for a freeze and reform resonates as a crucial step towards ensuring that citizens can find some semblance of financial stability amidst an ever-challenging landscape.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_prepare-for-the-push-towards-digital-id/content_809.html": "Prepare for the push towards digital ID\nThe UK’s Digital IDs: A Gateway to a Surveillance State?\nThe UK is on the verge of rolling out digital IDs, and it’s a development that demands close scrutiny. The Labour government has announced plans to introduce digital driving licences and online age verification systems. On the surface, these measures are portrayed as conveniences, but a deeper examination reveals significant concerns about privacy, freedom, and control.\nThe Introduction of Digital Driving Licences\nThe government has proposed “voluntary” digital driving licences, presenting them as a modern, convenient solution. Imagine proving your age at a pub or boarding a domestic flight with just a tap on your smartphone. It sounds appealing at first glance, but the real implications merit further investigation.\nHistory suggests that what begins as voluntary often becomes the only viable option. Introducing digital systems while gradually phasing out traditional alternatives can ultimately leave citizens with no choice but to comply. This raises questions about how long physical licences will remain practical or even available.\nAdditionally, these digital licences will not integrate with familiar platforms like Apple Wallet or Google Pay. Instead, users will need to adopt a government-specific app, consolidating sensitive personal information under state control. While promises of biometric security and high-tech safeguards are made, no system is entirely secure. The risk of data breaches is real and inevitable. When breaches occur, it won’t be government officials’ data at risk – it will be yours.\nThe scope of these digital licences extends beyond driving. They are also proposed for voting, tax payments, and benefits claims, paving the way for a comprehensive surveillance ecosystem. Every aspect of citizens’ lives could potentially be monitored, tracked, and controlled, effectively making the government privy to private information. The justification? It’s marketed as a feature, not a flaw.\nFor example, the app will offer options like hiding your address. But why does it require your address in the first place? This raises a critical point: this initiative isn’t about enhancing privacy but rather about normalising governmental access to personal data.\nOnline Age Verification and the Online Safety Act\nAnother significant development is the government’s push for stringent age verification under the Online Safety Act, to be enforced by July 2025. This measure aims to ensure that users accessing certain online content verify their age through facial recognition or by submitting photo identification.\nWhile protecting children online is undoubtedly a noble goal, the implications of such a system are concerning. To exercise the basic right to access legal content, adults would need to submit personal data to a faceless system. Where this data is stored, who has access to it, and how it might be used in the future remain unanswered questions.\nThe risk of “mission creep” is a pressing concern. What starts as age verification today could evolve into monitoring online activities, news consumption, or even personal opinions under the guise of public good. Once such data is linked to a digital identity, it’s virtually impossible to undo the system.\nTwo Sides of the Same Coin\nDigital driving licences and online age verification may seem like separate issues, but they are interconnected. Together, they could lead to a society where a digital ID is required not only for driving but for internet access. In such a scenario, every click, search, and online interaction would be tied to a government-issued identity, eroding personal privacy and autonomy.\nAlthough the government assures that these systems are voluntary, the ultimate goal appears to be centralised control. Advocates of the system often dismiss concerns with the phrase, “If you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear.” However, this perspective undermines the principle of freedom. Privacy isn’t about hiding wrongdoing; it’s about maintaining the dignity of a private life free from unnecessary scrutiny.\nA Threat to Democracy\nThe introduction of such measures has profound implications for democracy. A government with the power to track every move of its citizens – both online and offline – risks turning individuals into subjects. History offers numerous examples of governments that have abused such power, often to the detriment of their people.\nEconomic interests also play a role. The data collected through these systems is likely to benefit big tech companies and government contractors. Citizens, meanwhile, bear the cost of their privacy being sold and exploited.\nSome argue that other countries, such as China, have embraced digital IDs. However, China’s social credit system, which rates and controls citizens’ behaviour, serves as a cautionary tale. The UK must carefully consider whether this is a path it wants to follow.\nThe Risks of a Digital Society\nAside from the ethical concerns, the reliance on digital systems exposes citizens to significant risks. Hackers, foreign governments, and even rogue employees could exploit these systems. Moreover, individuals who are not tech-savvy, such as some elderly or disabled people, as well as those in rural areas with limited internet access, may face exclusion from society. This could create a two-tier system, leaving certain groups ostracised.\nThe Need for Public Debate\nThe government appears to be rushing into this digital transformation without adequate public consultation. The public deserves a robust and open debate on the implications of these technologies. Hard questions must be asked, and clear answers provided before irreversible steps are taken.\nThis is a pivotal moment for privacy, freedom, and the UK’s democratic way of life. While the digital world offers remarkable opportunities, it also poses unprecedented threats to liberty. In the rush to embrace technological advancements, it’s crucial not to surrender the very freedoms that make society worth living in.\nThe Call to Action\nIt is essential for citizens to stand up, speak out, and demand transparency and accountability. Most importantly, individuals must retain the right to choose whether to participate in these systems. Once privacy and freedom are relinquished, they may never be regained.\nThe UK faces a critical crossroads. As digital IDs and surveillance systems loom on the horizon, the choices made today will shape the nation’s future. Will the UK embrace convenience at the cost of liberty, or will it defend its democratic values? Only time – and public action – will tell.\nSummary\n- Introduction of Digital IDs: The UK government is rolling out digital driving licences and online age verification, claiming these measures are for convenience. Critics argue they pave the way for government control and surveillance.\n- Concerns About Digital Driving Licences:\n- Presented as “voluntary,” but history suggests such systems often become mandatory over time.\n- Centralised app raises privacy concerns, with biometric security unable to guarantee absolute safety from breaches.\n- Planned use for voting, tax payments, and benefits integration hints at the creation of a surveillance ecosystem.\n- Online Age Verification:\n- Under the Online Safety Act, stringent age checks will be required for certain online content by July 2025, including facial recognition or photo ID submission.\n- Risks linking digital identities to online activities, increasing the likelihood of “mission creep,” where the system’s purpose expands beyond its original scope.\n- Interconnected Issues:\n- Digital IDs could become necessary not just for driving but for internet access, tying every online interaction to government-issued identification.\n- Raises concerns about privacy, autonomy, and freedom, with critics arguing this is a push for centralised control.\n- Threat to Democracy:\n- Government monitoring of citizens’ activities risks turning individuals into subjects.\n- Data collection is expected to benefit big tech companies and contractors, not ordinary citizens.\n- Comparisons to China’s social credit system highlight the potential dangers of a surveillance state.\n- Exclusion Risks:\n- Digital systems could marginalise vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, disabled, or those in areas with poor internet access, creating a two-tier society.\n- Call for Public Debate:\n- Critics demand transparency, accountability, and proper public consultation before these measures are implemented.\n- Citizens are urged to speak out to protect privacy, freedom, and democratic values.\n- Conclusion:\n- The digital transformation offers opportunities but also unprecedented threats to liberty.\n- Citizens must ensure that in pursuing modernisation, fundamental freedoms are not sacrificed.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_more-farmland-under-threat-in-northampton/content_647.html": "More farmland under threat in Northampton\nProposed Housing Development Faces Backlash in Harpole Village\nA plan to construct 450 new homes on farmland near the village of Harpole, just outside Northampton, has sparked widespread opposition from local residents. The development, proposed by Davidsons Developments Ltd, would be situated on greenfield sites off Nobottle Road.\nWest Northamptonshire Council has informed the applicant that an Environmental Impact Assessment is not required for the initial phase of 100 homes and a new roundabout. A council officer stated, “The local planning authority is of the opinion that the proposed development would be unlikely to have significant effects on the environment.”\nHowever, the proposal has drawn criticism from villagers who are concerned about the potential impact on their community. Harpole Parish Council revealed that around 50 objections have been submitted by residents against the likely new development.\nThe council acknowledged the concerns surrounding the new roundabout at the top of Road Hill, which would serve as the entrance to the proposed estate. Residents fear that this access point could funnel traffic through the village, exacerbating existing issues caused by the closure of Sandy Lane since June, which has forced motorists to use Harpole as a shortcut to the A4500 and M1.\nOne resident expressed frustration, stating, “I understand new houses need to be built, but sensible planning could avoid the increase of traffic through Harpole. The village is entirely unsuitable to become a corridor for traffic. It seems unfair that large-scale planning can destroy the nature of a historical village.”\nAnother resident simply pleaded, “Please stop,” while a third lamented, “The beautiful countryside that Northamptonshire is famous for is being eroded by you. Soon all that will remain are large identical housing estates. That will be your legacy for future generations.”\nThe proposed development is one of several housing projects currently underway in the area, including Norwood Quarter, Western Gate, and Harlestone Park, which collectively will introduce thousands of new residents to the region.\nWhile the Harpole Parish Council acknowledges the inevitability of the planning application and the need for public consultation, they also recognize the challenge of objecting without valid planning reasons, stating, “The council would need planning reasons to say they object and can’t just say we have enough building happening.”\nAs the debate continues, residents remain vigilant in voicing their concerns about the potential impact on their village and the surrounding countryside.\nThe 30.77 acre parcel of land located just off the A4500, directly opposite the village of Harpole, is now up for sale for £375k.\nOf notable interest is a stipulation within the sale agreement, whereby the sellers of the land get to keep 25 per cent of any extra money made if the land is used for something other than farming for the next 50 years after the sale is finalised.\nWhy we must stop the loss of our farmland\nWe have lost thousands of acres of valuable farmland in recent years, with the process accelerated by productive farmland also being set aside for solar/wind farms. Our food production is now just 50%, which puts the entire nation at risk of starvation in the event of a conflict. There are brownfield sites with capacity for millions of homes throughout the country, yet developers seek out clean useable farmland, because the building process is easier for them, much quicker and results in higher profits, especially as the major developers landbank to control availability which impacts prices.\nIn an age where the plan is to reduce dependency on cars, why are we still obsessed with suburbia, when there are so many ways to redevelop inner cities, both for residents and businesses, without losing yet more important farmland.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_what-is-an-empath/content_364.html": "Being an empath is when you are affected by other people’s energies, and have an innate ability to intuitively feel and perceive others. Your life is unconsciously influenced by others’ desires, wishes, thoughts, and moods. Being an empath is much more than being highly sensitive and it’s not just limited to emotions.\nEmpaths can perceive physical sensitivities and spiritual urges, as well as just knowing the motivations and intentions of other people. You either are an empath or you aren’t. It’s not a trait that is learned. You are always open, so to speak, to process other people’s feelings and energy, which means that you really feel, and in many cases take on the emotions of others. Many empaths experience things like chronic fatigue, environmental sensitivities, or unexplained aches and pains daily. These are all things that are more likely to be contributed to outside influences and not so much yourself at all. Essentially you are walking around in this world with all of the accumulated karma, emotions, and energy from others.\nEmpaths have a tendency to openly feel what is outside of them more so than what is inside of them.\nEmpaths are often quiet achievers. They can take a while to handle a compliment for they’re more inclined to point out another’s positive attributes. They are highly expressive in all areas of emotional connection, and talk openly, and, at times quite frankly. They may have few problems talking about their feelings if another cares to listen (regardless of how much they listen to others).\nHowever, they can be the exact opposite: reclusive and apparently unresponsive at the best of times. They may even appear ignorant. Some are very good at “blocking out” others and that’s not always a bad thing, at least for the learning empath struggling with a barrage of emotions from others, as well as their own feelings.\nEmpaths have a tendency to openly feel what is outside of them more so than what is inside of them. This can cause empaths to ignore their own needs. In general an empath is non-violent, non-aggressive and leans more towards being the peacemaker. Any area filled with disharmony creates an uncomfortable feeling in an empath. If they find themselves in the middle of a confrontation, they will endeavor to settle the situation as quickly as possible, if not avoid it all together. If any harsh words are expressed in defending themselves, they will likely resent their lack of self-control, and have a preference to peacefully resolve the problem quickly.\nEmpaths are more inclined to pick up another’s feelings and project it back without realising its origin in the first place. Talking things out is a major factor in releasing emotions in the learning empath. Empaths can develop an even stronger degree of understanding so that they can find peace in most situations. The downside is that empaths may bottle up emotions and build barriers sky-high so as to not let others know of their innermost thoughts and/or feelings. This withholding of emotional expression can be a direct result of a traumatic experience, an expressionless upbringing, or simply being told as a child, “Children are meant to be seen and not heard!”\nWithout a doubt, this emotional withholding can be detrimental to one’s health, for the longer one’s thoughts and/or emotions aren’t released, the more power they build. The thoughts and/or emotions can eventually becoming explosive, if not crippling. The need to express oneself honestly is a form of healing and a choice open to all. To not do so can result in a breakdown of the person and result in mental/emotional instability or the creation of a physical ailment, illness or disease.\nEmpaths are sensitive to TV, videos, movies, news and broadcasts. Violence or emotional dramas depicting shocking scenes of physical or emotional pain inflicted on adults, children or animals can bring an empath easily to tears. At times, they may feel physically ill or choke back the tears. Some empaths will struggle to comprehend any such cruelty, and may have grave difficulty in expressing themselves in the face of another’s ignorance, closed-mindedness and obvious lack of compassion. They simply cannot justify the suffering they feel and see.\nEmpaths are more inclined to pick up another’s feelings and project it back without realising its origin in the first place.\nYou will find empaths working with people, animals or nature with a true passion and dedication to help them. They are often tireless teachers and/or caretakers for our environment and all within it. Many volunteers are empathic and give up personal time to help others without pay and/or recognition.\nEmpaths may be excellent storytellers due to an endless imagination, inquisitive minds and ever expanding knowledge. They can be old romantics at heart and very gentle. They may also be the “keepers” of ancestral knowledge and family history. If not the obvious family historians, they may be the ones who listen to the stories passed down and possess the majority of the family history. Not surprisingly, they may have started or possess a family tree.\nThey have a broad interest in music to suit their many expressive temperaments, and others can query how empaths can listen to one style of music, and within minutes, change to something entirely different. Lyrics within a song can have adverse, powerful effects on empaths, especially if it is relevant to a recent experience. In these moments, it is advisable for empaths to listen to music without lyrics, to avoid playing havoc with their emotions!\nThey are just as expressive with body language as with words, thoughts, and feelings. Their creativity is often expressed through dance, acting, and bodily movements. Empaths can project an incredible amount of energy portraying and/or releasing emotion. Empaths can become lost in the music, to the point of being in a trance like state; they become one with the music through the expression of their physical bodies. They describe this feeling as a time when all else around them is almost non existent.\nPeople of all walks of life and animals are attracted to the warmth and genuine compassion of empaths. Regardless of whether others are aware of one being empathic, people are drawn to them as a metal object is to a magnet!\nEven complete strangers find it easy to talk to empaths about the most personal things, and before they know it, they have poured out their hearts and souls without intending to do so consciously. It is as though on a sub-conscious level that person knows instinctively that empaths would listen with compassionate understanding. Then again, for empaths, it is always nice to actually be heard themselves!\nHere are the listeners of life. They can be outgoing, bubbly, enthusiastic and a joy to be in the presence of, as well as highly humorous at the most unusual moments! On the flip side, empaths can be weighted with mood swings that will have others around them want to jump overboard and abandon ship! The thoughts and feelings empaths receive from any and all in their life can be so overwhelming (if not understood) that their moods can fluctuate with lightning speed. One moment they may be delightfully happy and with a flick of the switch, miserable.\nAbandoning an empath in the throes of alternating moods can create detrimental effects. A simple return of empathic love listening and caring compassionately without bias, judgment and/or condemnation can go an incredibly long way to an empath’s instant recovery. Many empaths don’t understand what is occurring within them. They literally have no idea that another person’s emotions are now felt, as one’s own and reflected outwardly. They are confused as to how one moment all was well, and then the next, they feel so depressed, alone, etc. The need to understand the possibilities of empath connection is a vital part of the empaths journey for themselves and for those around them.\nEmpaths are often problem solvers, thinkers, and studiers of many things. As far as empaths are concerned, where a problem is, so too is the answer. They often will search until they find one if only for peace of mind. This can certainly prove beneficial for others in their relationships, in the workplace, or on the home front. Where there is a will, there is a way and the empath will find it. The empath can literally (likely without the knowledge of what’s actually occurring) tap into Universal Knowledge and be receptive to guidance in solving anything they put their head and hearts into.\nEmpaths often are vivid and/or lucid dreamers. They can dream in detail and are inquisitive of dream content. Often they feel as though the dreams are linked to their physical life somehow, and not just a mumble of nonsensical, irrelevant, meaningless images. This curiosity will lead many empathic dreamers to unravel some of the “mysterious” dream contents from an early age and connect the interpretation to its relevance in their physical life. If not, they may be led to dream interpretations through other means.\nEmpaths are daydreamers with difficulty keeping focused on the mundane. If life isn’t stimulating, off an empath will go into a detached state of mind. They will go somewhere, anywhere, in a thought that appears detached from the physical reality, yet is alive and active for they really are off and away. If a tutor is lecturing with little to no emotional input, empaths will not be receptive to such teaching and can (unintentionally) drift into a state of daydreaming.\nEmpaths frequently experience déjà vu and synchronicities. What may initially start as, “Oh, what a coincidence”, will lead to the understanding of synchronicities as an aspect of who they are. These synchronicities will become a welcomed and continually expanding occurrence. As an understanding of self grows, the synchronicities become more fluent and free flowing. The synchronicities can promote a feeling of euphoria as empaths identify with them and appreciate the connection to their empathic nature.\nEmpaths are most likely to have had varying paranormal experiences throughout their lives. NDE’s (Near death experiences) and or OBE’s (Out of body experiences) can catapult an unaware empath into the awakening period and provide the momentum for a journey of discovery. Those who get caught up in life, in society’s often dictating ways, in work etc., can become lost in a mechanical way of living that provides very little meaning. All “signs of guidance” are ignored to shift out of this state of “doing”. A path to being whole again becomes evident and a search for more meaning in one’s life begins.\nThese types of experiences appear dramatic, can be life-altering indeed, and are most assuredly just as intensely memorable in years to come. They are the voice of guidance encouraging us to pursue our journey in awareness. Sometimes, some of us require that extra assistance.\nFor some empaths, the lack of outside understanding towards paranormal events they experience, may lead to suppressing such abilities. (Most of these abilities are very natural and not a coincidence.) Empaths may unknowingly adopt the positive or negative attitude of others as their own. (This, however, can be overcome.) Empaths may need to follow interests in the paranormal and the unexplained with curiosity so as to explain and accept their life circumstances.\nHere are 17 of the most common traits:\n1. Knowing: Empaths just know stuff, without being told. It’s a knowing that goes way beyond intuition or gut feelings, even though that is how many would describe the knowing. The more attuned they are the stronger this gift becomes.\n2. Being in public places can be overwhelming: Places like shopping malls, supermarkets or stadiums where there are lots of people around can fill the empath with turbulently vexed emotions that are coming from others.\n3. Feeling others emotions and taking them on as your own: This is a huge one for empaths. To some they will feel emotions off those near by and with others they will feel emotions from those a vast distance away, or both. The more adept empath will know if someone is having bad thoughts about them, even from great distance.\n4. Watching violence, cruelty or tragedy on the TV is unbearable: The more attuned an empath becomes the worse it is and may make it so they eventually have to stop watching TV and reading newspapers altogether.\n5. You know when someone is not being honest: If a friend or a loved one is telling you lies you know it (although many empaths try not to focus on this because knowing a loved one is lying can be painful). Or if someone is saying one thing but feeling/thinking another, you know.\n6. Picking up physical symptoms off another: An empath will almost always develop the ailments off another (colds, eye infections, body aches and pains) especially those they’re closest to, somewhat like sympathy pains.\n7. Digestive disorders and lower back problems: The solar plexus chakra is based in the centre of the abdomen and it’s known as the seat of emotions. This is where empaths feel the incoming emotion of another, which can weaken the area and eventually lead to anything from stomach ulcers to IBS (too many other conditions to list here). Lower back problems can develop from being ungrounded (amongst other things) and one, who has no knowledge of them being an empath, will almost always be ungrounded.\n8. Always looking out for the underdog: Anyone whose suffering, in emotional pain or being bullied draws an empath’s attention and compassion.\n9. Others will want to offload their problems on you, even strangers: An empath can become a dumping ground for everyone else’s issues and problems, which, if they’re not careful can end up as their own.\n10. Constant fatigue: Empaths often get drained of energy, either from energy vampires or just taking on too much from others, which even sleep will not cure. Many get diagnosed with ME.\n11. Addictive personality: Alcohol, drugs, sex, are to name but a few addictions that empaths turn to, to block out the emotions of others. It is a form of self protection in order to hide from someone or something.\n12. Drawn to healing, holistic therapies and all things metaphysical: Although many empaths would love to heal others they can end up turning away from being healers (even though they have a natural ability for it), after they’ve studied and qualified, because they take on too much from the one they are trying to heal. Especially if they are unaware of their empathy. Anything of a supernatural nature is of interest to empaths and they don’t surprise or get shocked easily. Even at the revelation of what many others would consider unthinkable, for example, empaths would have known the world was round when others believed it was flat.\n13. Creative: From singing, dancing, acting, drawing or writing an empath will have a strong creative streak and a vivid imagination.\n14. Love of nature and animals: Being outdoors in nature is a must for empaths and pets are an essential part of their life.\n15. Need for solitude: An empath will go stir crazy if they don’t get quiet time. This is even obvious in empathic children.\n16. Gets bored or distracted easily if not stimulated: Work, school and home life has to be kept interesting for an empath or they switch off from it and end up daydreaming or doodling.\n17. Finds it impossible to do things they don’t enjoy: As above. Feels like they are living a lie by doing so. To force an empath to do something they dislike through guilt or labelling them as idle will only serve in making them unhappy.\nPSYCHIC ATTACKS.\nWays to protect yourself and to recognize consciously those that may possibly be attacking you..\nEnergy stealers are everywhere! They are your family members, your friends and they are your co workers and YOU may even be one yourself. A more common name is a Psychic Vampire and we all know what vampires do! In this case the vampire is sucking our vital energy, depleting us and causing us to become unhealthy emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. Spiritual purification and cord cutting are some tools that can keep the vampires away.\nWhat does the term ‘Psychic Vampire’ mean anyway? A psychic vampire is a person that steals other people’s energies because they are living their life in victim consciousness and believe that everything happens ’to’ them. They are often heard saying “Why Me?” They are constantly negative, they are whiny, they gossip, they are angry, sad, afraid, etc. Living in this manner is very dis-empowering.\nIn order for these people to feel better about themselves they need to attach themselves to another person’s energy field. In order for this ‘vampire’ to attach themselves to your energy body, they form cords attaching the two of you together. (These cords are not visible to the naked eye but they can be seen with the psychic third eye.) When they need a boost, they unconsciously steal your energy instead of using their own.\nAt some level you have allowed this to take place, perhaps when you were having a conversation you opened your energy field with compassion and they latched on immediately to your generosity and kindness. Let me ask you this, have you ever felt great before you talked to so and so either on the phone or in person but after you hung up or parted ways you felt just depleted? Uh-huh, a psychic attack just took place. Your vampire friend just ‘came and sucked your energy.’\nNow this is not something to get all paranoid about nor go into fear over! It happens every day, all the time, to people everywhere, however, what is important is that you take positive steps in protecting yourself so you can stop this from happening to you. Self empowerment is powerful and freeing.\nYou need to learn psychic protection to empower yourself because the cords that are formed between the two of you are like highways and they run both ways. That means that you will also receive their energy whether it is positive or negative. If they have a headache, you may also develop a headache. It they are depressed, you may become depressed. If they are angry, you may become angry and so on. As you can see this can be very detrimental to your health.\nThese cords prevent you from really being the real you so it is imperative that these cords be severed and sometimes a spiritual purification is required for your well-being and also for the growth of the other person.\nHow do we recognize a psychic vampire?\nHere are some traits of the dis-empowered energy stealer:\nfeels lonely or abandoned\nfeels they have been rejected\nneeds constant reassurance\nnever feels satisfied\ndoesn’t like to be alone\nseeks nurturing or feels they need to be taken care of\nlow energy and fatigued\nthey have a poor me attitude\nis a drama king or queen\nconstant talker that never allows you to speak\nneeds you to be their therapist or rescuer fixing their problems\nthe blamer making you feel guilty about things\nvindictive by putting you down\na person that is unhappy a lot\ntries controlling you or your life\nmanipulates you to get things their way\nHow do I know if I am being psychically attacked?\ndizziness\nloss of energy\nmuscle tension\nmental confusion\nheadaches\nchronic fatigue\nnightmares\nsleep disturbances\nirritability\ndepressed mood\nphysical illness\nsmall diminishing aura\nleaks, holes and/or tears in your aura\nand a whole lot more.\nI know, you are now thinking that is almost everyone alive! Unfortunately, too many people are simply not aware of their energetic bodies and how they operate. Once people start taking responsibility for creating their own lives and taking back their personal power this will not be an epidemic. (Granted other conditions also can be the cause of these symptoms besides being psychically attacked.)\nThose that psychically attack others either do this consciously or unconsciously. Either way it is detrimental to your health, in all areas of your energetic being, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.\nHow do I protect myself from this? For starters you need to become aware of which individuals deplete your energy and limit your contact with them. But simply not being in their physical presence does not stop them from draining you. There are protection techniques shared below to help combat this. Also you need to be aware that not all people attacking you are people that you know. Secondly, you need to release all the negative emotions that you carry within yourself. If you hold anger, hurt, jealousy etc. inside your being, it is like you are shackled to a ball and chain, holding you hostage with your own creation. Releasing of all negative emotions brings freedom as fear is the robber of peace. Why must I do this?\nBecause any disharmony in our four energetic bodies will cause us to be vulnerable, so that darkness and confusion can enter. Being aware of this is empowering.\nI stress this, do not go into fear now that you are aware of this. Simply take the steps to protect yourself. Darkness consists of anything that is of a lower/heavier vibration such as anger, fear, depression, jealousy, hatred etc. When angry thoughts are directed at you, they can penetrate your weak and vulnerable areas like arrows. What happens is they take away your clarity and fill you with confusion and drain your energy.\nFollowing are some tools to empower yourself from Psychic Vampires.\nCord Cutting~๑~ Cord cutting should be done on a daily basis and much more often when we are going through a stressful period in our life. These cords should be cut from our loved ones as well. No cord attached to anyone or thing is good. • Take some deep cleansing breaths. In through the nose and out through the mouth. Call upon ArchAngel Michael and ask him for his assistance in cutting all cords that are attached to your being. Visualise Archangel Michael swirling his sword around your entire being severing all the cords. Know that no cord can remain intact and they are returning to where they came from. When you feel Michael has completed this process, thank him for his assistance. It is done. Easy as that.\nBubble of White Light • Ask the angels to put a bubble of white light around you. Make this a thick white band of energy. Then visualise or watch them putting a dark blue energy around that, then a golden energy around that. Finally, especially if you often pick up other peoples problems, place a violet colour around the outside, which will keep you safe from the negative energies of others.\nThe Blue Cloak • Deep blue is a very protective colour. It is the colour of Archangel Michael who is the protector. With your imagination draw in your aura and then put a deep blue cloak over it. Pull the hood over your head and zip the cloak up from under your feet to your chin. Feel and know that you are completely protected.\nMirrors • You can also shield yourself by visualising yourself being encapsulated in the White Light and then envision a circle of mirrors around you that face outward. This reflects the negative energy away from you.\nHere are some physical steps for purification.\nღ – Burn all relevant photographs or objects holding memories of the person, place or situation.\nღ – Write down all feelings of frustration, anger, hurt, fear, etc., give forgiveness and then burn the paper, flush it down the toilet or bury it. Please don’t give it to the person. Repeat this step as often as necessary.\nღ – Clear all the clutter from every room of your home. Rule of thumb. If you haven’t used in 6 months it’s not likely you will. Get rid of it. Doing this simple exercise will feel like you have an amazing weight lifted off your shoulders.\nღ – Clean and if necessary redecorate your home. Bringing nature indoors is wonderful energy.\nღ – Check there are no books in your bookshelves or pictures on your walls that have negative energy. Surround yourself with high vibrational objects, spiritual books, spiritual pictures, plants, fresh flowers etc.\nღ – Sprinkle holy water in all rooms starting at the centre spiralling outwards.\nღ – Smudge with sage, cedar and sweet-grass and invoke the help of God, the Ascended Masters, the Great White Brother and Sisterhood, the Archangels and Angels, your Higher self and I AM Presence.\nღ – Play sacred music and sing, chant OM or say The Lord’s Prayer.\nღ – Stop listening to negative television and radio shows.\nღ – Stop reading negative papers, books, magazines, gossip rags.\nღ – Begin a meditation practice o – Cleanse and purify your crystals and dedicate them to the Light.\nღ – Wear or carry crystals on your body.\nღ – Light candles and use high vibrational pure essential oils.\nღ – Receive energy healing treatments to repair any leaks, tares and holes in your aura.\nYou now have a few tools to put in your spiritual toolbox and knowledge to take back your personal power. I invite you to empower yourself today!\nI share this as, this kind of thing does happen. Although not all of us are aware of why and not all believe in the “Psychic Attacks and Energy Vampires” as wordings. I myself have come to recognize that being a worker of Light.. That this does happen, and protection is needed, where to call upon our Own Angelic Guides and Angelic Team to assist in keeping us protected, but also to use the crystals that have called out to aid in such protection.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_reform-share-of-vote-in-blackpool-up-by-277/content_1164.html": "Reform share of vote in Blackpool up by 277%\nThe Conservatives suffered a stinging defeat in the Blackpool South by-election, narrowly edging out the Reform UK party by a mere 117 votes to secure second place. Labour’s Chris Webb secured a resounding victory, amassing 10,825 votes and a commanding majority of 7,607, which equates to 58.9% of the total votes cast.\nThis by-election result has been dubbed “a seismic win” by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, with the swing from the Conservatives to Labour standing at an astonishing 26%, the third-largest since the Second World War. Such a substantial swing far exceeds the 12.5% figure that Labour sources suggest would be necessary to secure victory in a general election.\nReform UK, led by Richard Tice, achieved an unprecedented 16.9% of the vote share, their highest ever result, and came agonisingly close to ousting the Conservatives from second place. Tice hailed the performance as “onwards and upwards” for his party, which has steadily gained ground in opinion polls over the past year.\nMark Butcher, Reform UK’s candidate, described his party’s vote share as “incredible” and vowed to contest the seat again at the next general election, asserting that they had “made a massive statement” and “done more than give the Conservatives a bloody nose.”\nIn contrast, the Conservative candidate, David Jones, declined to answer questions as he left the Blackpool Sports Centre after the result was announced at 4:50 am, following a turnout of just 32.5%.\nSir Keir Starmer lauded the victory as “the most important result today,” emphasising that it represented a direct message from voters to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, demanding change. “The people of Blackpool South had spoken for Britain,” proclaimed the victorious Webb, who will succeed the former Tory MP Scott Benton, who resigned earlier this year amidst a lobbying scandal.\nWebb lambasted the Conservatives, asserting that the British people had lost trust in the party after 14 years in power. “They have had enough of this failed government,” he declared, calling on Sunak to “admit you’ve failed and call a general election.”\nThe dismal performance by the Conservatives has only exacerbated the simmering discontent within the party’s ranks. David Campbell Bannerman, a prominent figure on the Conservative Right, warned that Sunak’s leadership would be untenable if Reform UK had surpassed the Conservatives for second place, stating, “With the right Conservative leader and true Tory policies, Conservatives can be transformed. Watch this space.”\nProfessor Sir John Curtice, a renowned elections expert, highlighted the gravity of the situation for the Conservatives, asserting, “The only thing that’s stopped this result from being basically an unmitigated disaster for the Conservatives was the fact they just narrowly squeaked ahead of Reform.” He added a sobering assessment: “Basically, the project that Rishi Sunak is meant to be there to achieve, which is to narrow the gap on Labour, that project still has yet to provide any visible benefit.”\nThe Blackpool South by-election has undoubtedly sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with Labour basking in a decisive victory and the Conservatives facing mounting pressure and internal turmoil. The surge of support for Reform UK, a relatively new political force, has added an intriguing dynamic to the electoral landscape, potentially disrupting the traditional two-party dominance.\nAs the nation grapples with the implications of this seismic result, the spotlight will inevitably shift towards the next general election, where the true test of the respective parties’ fortunes will unfold. For the Conservatives, the challenges are mounting, and the need for decisive action and a convincing narrative to regain voter trust has never been more pressing.\nThe results compared to the last election\n| Party | 2019 | 2024 |\n| Conservative | 49.6% | 17.5% |\n| Labour | 38.3% | 49.6% |\n| Brexit/Reform | 6.1% | 16.9% |\nTHE FIGURES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES\nConservatives DOWN 65%\nLabour UP 53%\nReform UP 277%",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_have-you-been-warped-by-pornography/content_858.html": "Have you been warped by pornography\n- One-third of Pornhub’s 15 million UK monthly viewers are women, figures show\n- There has been a dramatic increase in Porn induced erectile dysfunction. (PIED)\n- Young women are become less sexually active due to Porn.\n- There is a distinct increase in aggression towards women as a result of Porn.\nConcerns have been raised in recent years about young men watching explicit content and the potential harms it can cause, including erectile dysfunction and depressive disorders.\nRoughly half of twentysomething men watch adult material at least once a monthly, according to recent surveys. But experts have now sounded the alarm over the damage that viewing pornography can have on women.\nRecent studies have shown that women aged 18 to 24 are having 20 per cent less sex than women their age were a decade ago.\n‘The biggest change we’ve seen over the past few years is that pornography has gone from something that was considered naughty to the norm among young people,’ says Anastasia Sprout, a psychotherapist specialising in porn addiction.\n‘It’s almost as if women are seen as sexually empowered and confident if they like it – it’s viewed as a positive thing. And if you don’t watch it, or you don’t like it, there’s something wrong with you.’\nThe ‘increasingly extreme’ nature of adult content today is making young women fearful of sex. She says: ‘Women who watch it a lot become worried about the way their bodies look or perform sexually, because they’re making constant comparisons.\n‘Often, they don’t want to do what they think is expected of them, because it is painful or just isn’t pleasurable for them. This all leads to overwhelming anxiety and a sense of dread about sex, and this can lead to pain during sex.\nStudies have shown that adolescents who look at a lot of these sorts of images – enviably trim women wearing revealing underwear – are more likely to develop anxiety, depression and eating disorders.\nRecent research revealed that at least 40 per cent of the free-to-view adult content online features some sort of verbal or physical aggression directed toward a woman.\nBrain imaging studies have shown little difference between the genders in how they respond to pornography. Watching explicit videos triggers a surge in the brain chemical responsible for reward and pleasure, dopamine, which also happens during sex. But over time the brain becomes desensitised to dopamine’s effects, meaning porn users must seek out increasingly unrealistic or extreme content to feel good. This also means they find it increasingly difficult to become aroused during real sexual encounters.\nWhat is happening here?\nDuring the reign of Queen Victoria, men would become aroused at the mere sight of a woman’s limb. Over the decades, we have been presented with an ever-increasing display of nudity and sexual connotations everywhere we look. In recent years, we have reached a point, where I personally, would spend more time looking at a woman who is beautifully dressed, than one who is naked, that is not good, in fact, that is catastrophic.\nFor those of us who grew up in the pre-porn days, the odd glimpse of a nude in a magazine, or even the PE teacher’s bra showing, would drive us in a frenzy of arousal, but sadly, that is not more.\nToday, similar situations would simply inspire a will to create a video for TikTok, to humiliate, or just for fun, the respect for intimacy and all matters sexual has died, but with that, there are far deeper concerns.\nThe evidence indicates that there is a distinct difference between those who began to watch porn as an adult and those who began watching porn during puberty, or more importantly, those who have experienced orgasm frequently by watching porn, before they ever have sex with another person, but what effect does this have?\nOnce again, the evidence suggests that in adults, watching too much porn, can reprogramme their mind, to the point that they are aroused more by porn, than by sex with another person. This eventually causes a serious problem, which is called ‘porn induced erectile dysfunction’ the inability to maintain an erection without porn.\nThe reality is, that real-life intimate encounters are not like porn, there are no perfectly scripted words, no professionally choreographed actions, no orgasms on cue and the entire event is fluid (pardon pun) as it is, or rather, should be, about the mutual expression, exploration and emotion of two people, that definitely is not the case with porn.\nThe danger is, that although adults who immerse themselves in porn, can be badly affected, no only becoming addicted, but also eventually suffering PIED, but in these cases, the problem can be overcome, with something called a ‘sexual reset’ which I will cover later.\nHowever, in teens, the damage is far more sinister, as young minds are still being shaped and developed, therefore there is sadly a growing number of young people whose entire sexual chemistry has been moulded by porn, leaving them with a serious form of PIED. The tragedy is, that once again, the evidence suggests that in the case of teens, a sexual reset is not always successful, sadly, due to the fact that porn has been set in their psychological development, the damage is increasingly permanent.\nIn addition to this, the violent undertone of porn is also having a damaging effect in the manner that young people interact when they are intimate. Using the word intimate, is almost inappropriate nowadays, as there is less and less intimacy, and increasing degree of emotionless hedonistic gratification.\nWhere young women are concerned, they too are being seriously affected by porn, with around a third of those watching porn being women, they too are being serious damaged by its effects, but in a different manner.\nWomen are allowing themselves to be sexually programmed by porn, being slowly indoctrinated with the submissive aggression that is so prevalent in sex in the modern day. The consequence of this is that women feel that they need to be willing participants in acts of aggression, degradation and acts that they neither find arousing or pleasing. With women constantly feeling that they are being directly compared to the perfectly choregraphed porn stars, many go on to be diagnosed with a condition called vaginismus – a fear of vaginal penetration, which causes the muscles to tighten involuntarily.\nAs a result, young women are gradually finding sex unattractive, as I have already said, women between the ages of 18-24 are having sex twenty percent less than a decade ago. This is catastrophic, as we all have fundamental needs, which are not to engage in a replay of porn, but to be intimate, to feel and share emotion, to be both physically and mentally aroused. The increased abstinence from sex, or the increase of aggressive sex, which leaves women feeling inadequate, abuses or degraded, this is causing serious psychological problems for young people.\nThere is a growing online movement devoted to giving up masturbation and even sex for extended periods – typically around 90 days. There is an organisation called ‘Nofap’ described as a community-centred sexual health platform, designed to help people overcome porn addiction and compulsive sexual behaviour.\nHere are some of the benefits of Nofap:\n| Claimed benefits of Nofap\n|\n||\n| Sexual | Physical | Mental |\n| Enhanced sexual enjoyment.\nStronger orgasms. Improved appreciation of healthy sexual relationships. Increased sex drive (although some report the opposite). Improved sexual self-regulation. |\nHigher energy levels\nMuscle growth. Better sleep. Improved focus and concentration. Better physical performance and stamina. Improved or cured erectile dysfunction. Improved sperm quality. Increased Testosterone. |\nIncreased happiness.\nBoosted confidence. Increased motivation and willpower. Lower levels of stress and anxiety. Heightened spirituality. Self-acceptance. Improved attitude and appreciation of the opposite sex. |\nCountering the argument for nofap is the well-documented benefits of sexual activity, including masturbation, on health. The release of endorphins during orgasm leads to positive feelings. Masturbation can help relieve built-up stress and assist relaxation, improve sleep, boost mood, release sexual tension and cramps and even allow a better understanding of sexual wants and needs. And in men there may even be some possible protection against prostate cancer from regular ejaculation, although this relationship is not fully clear yet.\nPsychological reasons\nIn fact, masturbation as such doesn’t appear to have any negative effects on sexual and general health, and particularly in relation to testosterone levels in men. The problem may lie in excessive masturbation and attitudes towards self-pleasure.\nPersonal perceptions of masturbation can cause psychological effects that impact testosterone levels. A build-up of anxiety and depression can occur if someone has feelings of guilt following masturbation. This guilt could be based around feeling immoral, such as being unfaithful to a partner or having religious conflicts.\nA study investigating the motivation for abstinence found that the reason was mostly due to attitudes, specifically the perception of masturbation as unhealthy or wrong.\nThis stress from prolonged guilt, anxiety and depression can cause decreases in testosterone levels and in these situations, abstinence may relieve such feelings and could then theoretically lead to a testosterone increase. Maybe, then, the argument shouldn’t be about changing the tendency or frequency of masturbation, but more about improving understanding and attitudes towards sexual behaviour.\nThat said, abstaining from masturbation could help people with destructive porn addictions. Taking a break from pornography, masturbation, or even sex altogether for an extended period of time could help break the cycle, or reboot from porn addiction.\nAs the benefits in the table suggested, abstinence in some actually lowers sex-drive, but why is that? Despite the common misconception by men, that women who have abstained from sex for a long time, may be in dire need of it, that is not always the case. Unlike men, with women, the case is often that continued abstinence results in a lessening physical need for sex, although the need for intimacy and emotion frequently remains. Therefore, a sexual reset for women can be significantly more difficult than in men, as the damage is ingrained far deeper than in their emotional needs.\nOnce women have subjected themselves to the sexual in doctrine of pornography, they struggle to remove the images that they have seen, they have flashbacks during sex, they feel that they will be compared, judged and cast-off as frigid, if they do not willingly and wantonly engage in the aggressive and degrading acts that they have watched online.\nIn conclusion, our society is being badly damaged by porn, this is not a case of young boys swooning over the photo of a naked lady, this is not the heightening of sexual desire through interaction, or any natural means.\nAs many of us know, on an evening out, interacting with someone who we find attractive can have a very positive effect on us, it can arouse us, excite us, it can ignite the flames of passion that lay dormant within us, inspire us to become passionate, sexual and driven by the ways of Eros, which is not only perfectly healthy, it also contributes to our emotional and psychological health.\nThis is not even about attraction to another person, it is not about intimacy, it is not about affection, this is an infernal demon that is implanted within us and nurtured by some of the worst emotions that humanity is capable of. We are not in need of immoral promiscuity; we are in need of natural human interaction that feeds the very instinct that drives us.\nFor over a century, women have fought a very difficult battle, just to be empowered with the right to be treated equally. Yet over the last two or three decades, we have seen this honourable and much needed battled skewed by sexuality. Younger and younger girls vying for sexual attention, flaunting themselves on social-media, in some sort of perverted exhibition. Is it not ironic, that many women’s movements objected to the famous beauty contest, ‘Miss World’ that we all used to love in the seventies, but they seem to be distinctly muted at the ubiquitous self-imposed exploitation of young women, who have been pressured in to feeling that they are judged on their sexuality, their lack of morality and ultimately, their lack of self-respect?\nIs this a case of society being so engrossed in rights for women, that it has forgotten that respect for women is even more important?\nThere has never been a more urgent need for us to address this, as individuals, communities and societies as a whole, because if we continue along the current trajectory, we face a serious social breakdown in the very near future. The incidence of abuse of women is increasing, sexual assaults are increasing, the basic lack of respect for women is in freefall, this is not how decent societies should function.\nThose of you who have read ‘Brave New World’ by Aldus Huxley, will already be aware that these are clear indications that our society is rapidly moving in to an age of hedonism, that may or may not be by design, but one thing is for certain, everything that decent people sacrificed their lives for in the past, is under threat, as we steam-roll in to moral bankruptcy.\nI will cover my view on social structure and the correlation between democracy, hedonism and collectivism in another article. What does this have to do with pornography? I would say that the relationship between pornography, hedonism and dystopian totalitarianism is closer than you may realise. Yes of course, this is in my opinion, one which I am happy to step out on a dangerous ledge to articulate, but not only am I willing to do so, I feel that I am obliged to do so, because the minute that we feel compelled to accept the narrative, to accept that which we are presented without question, is our complicity in our own destruction.\nThis is a serious problem, that is not being discussed enough. I’m pleased to see that you are raising questions about something that is rapidly becoming a social catastrophe.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_portrait-of-a-cypriot-village-kokkinotrimithia/content_194.html": "Kokkinotrimithia is a village in the Nicosia district in Cyprus and it is about 11 kilometres from the city of Nicosia. According to the inventory in 2011 it had 4.077 residents. It borders with Mammary which is at the north of the village, the Paleometocho which is at the south and Akaki which is to the east. The residential area of Kokkinotrimithia is divided into three zones, A and B communities and the central village. Also Kokkinotrimithia is the industrial area of the capital.\nThe population of Kokkinotrimithia is 5000 residents according to the inventory in 2013. History Kokkinotrimithia appeared on the Venetian maps as Tremitousa and according to Voustronius, is was given to Belaraz during the 14th century. According to the same historian during 1464-1468 it was given to the Venetian Louka Bragdine. However the history of Kokkinotrimithia becomes lost in the depth of history until the Age of the copper.\nThe village became well known was a prison camp where thousands of Greek-Cypriots were taken prisoners during the freedom war of EOKA 1955-1959. The prison camp was built by the English so that the political prisoners would be held there. It is located about 2km from the village and it operated during the end of 1955 until the beginning of 1959.\nThe camp is made up of many tall rows of wire, with wooden towers for the guards. After the Turkish invasion in 1974, the village had many refugees which increased the population and extended the residential area with the two refugee communities. To the north of Kokinotrimithia is the building of the Police Station which originally was a train station which operated in Cyprus during the first half of the 20th century. Architecture The centre of the community exhibits very nice samples of the local architecture.\nKokkinotrimithia has a total of five churches, four which have an interested due to their antiquity. In the centre there is the church of the Virgin Mary which is dated back to 1905. A little further there is a beautiful chapel of Saint George , which seems to be built on the ruins of an older church built during the 11th or 12th century and is a true gem for the community.\nAt the old cemetery there is an old church of the Archangel Michael which was built during the 16th century. The community churches The church of Entry of the Virgin Mary It is located between two churches, Archangel Michel and Saint George and it is devoted to the entry of the Virgin Mary.\nAccording to witnesses, they began building the church in 1900 and it was completed in 1906. The church is built with stone and is celebrated on the 21st of November every year. The church of Archangel Michael It is the most ancient church in the village and the exact date which it was built is unknown.\nIn historical books it is mentioned as the 16th century and in others in the 17th century. From the description of the church it is definite that it was completed by 1615. According to witnesses, this small chapel seems to be a chapel of the medieval feud because it is known even today as being Venetian.\nTo the right of the church there is a mural of Archangel Michael in very bad condition. The surrounding area of the church is used as a cemetery. The church of Saint George According to tradition the four churches in the village form a cross and that is why the fifth one was built later on. One of these churches is that of Saint George. It was built in the area which were the ruins of an older church and the residents lit candles to honour Saint George.\nThe builders managed to preserve some of the parts of the first chapel and it was rebuilt in 1989. At the church courtyard there is a monument in honour of the fallen and missing persons from the 1974 war. The church of Saint Mamandos It is located at the west of the village, in the area of Petrakoura. It was built a little while after the invasion at the first refugee community.\nThe church is about 6×14 metres. It is dedicated to Saint Mama the Saint of the Akrites to remind everyone the town of Saint Mamantos, Morfou and the neighbouring villages. The church is celebrated on the 2nd of September. The church of Apostle Varnavas Besides the ancient churches which are in the village, there is also a new one built during the last few years, dedicated to Apostle Varnavas the founder and protector of the church of Cyprus. This church operated for the first time during Christmas in 2005. It is the largest and most impressive church in the community. Education In the community there is a community kindergarten which existed since 1982 and during the year 2007-2008 the new public kindergarten operated as well.\nThe village of Kokkinotrimithia has two primary schools. The A ‘Primary school has operated since 1883 and the B’ Primary School since 1994-1995. It also has a regional gymnasium which operated in 2002. The M.Koutsofta and A.Panagidi Lyceum is also at the borders of the village and is in the Kokkinotrimithia region.",

I have always maintained that valuers should be immune from litigation based on their valuation, because ultimately, it is those in most need, who are exploited by them.\nThere are over 1 million parcels of land with or without permission that are owned by the large developers, who hold on to them to control the market and to squeeze out the smaller developers, more than half of planning granted in London is never implemented.\nThis practice must end now!\nThis is just one of many failings of an administration that claims to support business, yet in practice, it is clearly obvious that they only support themselves and their friends.\nVast sums of public money is paid voluntarily as interest on QE reserves, this is around £35 Billion per year, which should be stopped. We are on the verge of a total collapse in the Net Zero plans, because they are simply not working, but the cost is causing severe hardship, once again, this should be stopped, saving the British taxpayer around £30 Billion per year.\nThe list goes on and on, no incentives for investment in deprived areas, no incentives for work-based training, with the focus continuing to be for thousands of young people signing up to a lifetime of debt for ‘non-degrees’\nThe issue of online sales, in particular those from overseas that are below £135, which is by far the vast majority has not been addressed. I am in favour of sales tax, deducted at source, to ensure that those who sell in the UK should pay in the UK, this could also be used to level the playing field and help our high streets. I have no doubt that most people would like to see their high streets brought back to life.\nThe list goes on and on, but it seems that this administration has become so incompetent and so arrogant, that they really do believe that a token gesture would suffice to get them re-elected……….it will not.\nThe British public will send the Conservatives to the Gallows at the next election, and with that in mind, I would actually contradict their knee-jerk narrative:\n“A vote for the CONSERVATIVES is a vote for Labour!”",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_reeves-in-a-panic-before-trump-turns-the-screws/content_497.html": "Reeves in a panic before Trump turns the screws\nReeves Poised to Scrutinise £700m Tech Levy Amidst Escalating Global Trade Tensions\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to conduct a comprehensive review of the digital services tax (DST), a £700 million levy targeting American technological behemoths, as the spectre of an intensifying global trade conflict looms large on the horizon.\nThe impending reassessment comes at a particularly delicate moment in international economic relations, with significant diplomatic and financial implications for the United Kingdom’s trading relationships, particularly with the United States under the potential return of Donald Trump to the presidency.\nThe digital services tax, initially introduced in April 2020, currently imposes a 2% charge on the UK turnover of major technological corporations, generating approximately £678 million in Treasury revenues. This fiscal mechanism has become a potential flashpoint in international trade negotiations, with the United States expressing considerable reservations about its implementation.\nMounting Diplomatic Pressures\nThe Chancellor finds herself navigating a complex geopolitical landscape, facing intense pressure from multiple quarters. The White House is expected to exert substantial diplomatic pressure, with technology giants such as Apple, Amazon, and Google watching the review with keen interest. Simultaneously, the potential for retaliatory trade measures adds another layer of complexity to the strategic considerations.\nDonald Trump’s approach to international trade has been characterised by aggressive protectionist policies, with existing tariffs already imposed on several nations including Canada and China. His statements suggesting that duties on European Union imports are “definitely” forthcoming have further heightened tensions.\nInterestingly, Trump has simultaneously signalled a potential willingness to negotiate, suggesting that a compromise might be achievable to prevent punitive tariffs against the United Kingdom. This nuanced approach indicates the intricate diplomatic dance that lies ahead for British policymakers.\nExperts in international trade and taxation are closely monitoring the situation. John Denton, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, has noted significant potential for diplomatic pressure, stating: “I think there will be a lot of pressure put on the UK on this particular issue.”\nThe crux of Washington’s criticism centres on the perception that the digital services tax disproportionately targets American businesses, given their dominant position in the global technological ecosystem. Marco Forgione from the Institute of Export and International Trade articulated this sentiment succinctly, highlighting Trump’s desire to create the most favourable low-tax environment for US-based technological enterprises.\nPolitical Positioning and Strategic Considerations\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has adopted a conciliatory tone, emphasising the importance of maintaining “open and strong trading relations” with the United States. His diplomatic approach seeks to mitigate potential confrontational dynamics while preserving the UK’s strategic interests.\nThe tax was originally conceived as a temporary measure, intended to be replaced by comprehensive OECD tax reforms. However, these plans have been substantially complicated by the United States’ effective withdrawal from the global corporate tax agreement under Trump’s previous administration.\nTreasury Calculations and Strategic Implications\nWhile the £678 million generated by the digital services tax represents a notable revenue stream, financial experts suggest the Treasury could potentially forego this sum to maintain crucial transatlantic relations. David Henig of the UK Trade Policy Project indicates that the government is meticulously examining potential concessions.\nBeyond the digital services tax, another point of potential contention is the Online Safety Act, which has raised significant concerns within the Trump administration and among US legislators. A source close to the administration described the act as universally unpopular among Republican senators and congressmen.\nMarket Reactions and Economic Implications\nThe mere anticipation of potential trade tensions has already triggered market volatility. The FTSE 100 experienced a 1% decline, while currency traders adjusted their positions, with the pound experiencing a 0.88% appreciation against the euro, reflecting cautious optimism about the UK’s potential to navigate these complex diplomatic waters.\nA Treasury spokesperson has maintained a measured stance, emphasising that the 2025 review of the digital services tax was always planned, rejecting any implications of predetermined intentions regarding the levy’s future.\nThe unfolding scenario represents a delicate balancing act for the UK government: maintaining fiscal innovation, protecting domestic economic interests, and preserving critical international relationships in an increasingly complex global economic landscape.\nAs the review approaches, all eyes will be on Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her strategic approach to this multifaceted challenge, with potential ramifications for the UK’s international trade relationships and technological taxation policies.",

Some 600,000 more people work in the public sector. What is the result? Outcomes are far worse, growth is down and people are receiving a worse service from the public sector, where performance has collapsed. The idea that waste cannot be found, nor efficiencies made, obviously lacks any credibility.\nEveryone has to watch what they spend and make savings. So should the government. After all, they are spending our money, not theirs. We must change course urgently, or Britain will go bust. Reform UK would make sure your hard earned cash is treated with care and respect\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nBank of England Must Stop Paying Interest to Commercial Banks on QE Reserves.\nOther central banks are not doing this. Senior economists and a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England (BoE) agree. This saves £30-40 billion per year. The BoE must also stop Quantitative Tightening, which is negligently costing the taxpayer billions; stopping this will also help lower interest rates.\nSave £5 in every £100.\nWe make these saving in business and at home. The public sector must be no exception. Every manager across government must find savings without touching frontline services. We should slash wasteful spending, cut bureaucracy and negotiate better value procurement across every department. This will enable lower taxes, more money in your pocket and boost our economy. This saves £50 billion per year.\nScrap Unnecessary Government Quangos and Commissions.\nThere are over 600 government departments, Arm’s Length Bodies or Quangos. Many are unaccountable to parliament. Quango advisors can charge £1,000 per day. Some bosses are paid over £600k per year. Billions of pounds are wasted. The public wouldn’t notice if many dozens were scrapped. These savings are part of the £5 in every £100 mentioned above.\nBrexit Bonus. Cut Unnecessary Regulations.\nGovernment red tape and nanny state regulations are estimated to have cost the UK economy £143 billion since 2015. That means billions of pounds lost in growth and taxes.\nCut Foreign Aid by 50%.\nSave £6 billion from the £12.8 billion budget. British taxpayers should not be funding countries like China or India who have their own space programs. We can do much more good by spending less with better targeting. A major review is needed into the effectiveness of overseas aid.",

China wants to develop peaceful ties and ultimately reunify with the island, the official told an annual parliamentary session on Saturday.\n“All of us, Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, should come together to advance the great and glorious cause of China’s rejuvenation,” the premier said.\nThe head of the Chinese cabinet made the remarks as he was delivering his working report to members of China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), which they are to approve. The NPC and a separate advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), launched their two-week annual sessions on Friday.\nThe annual sessions are usually used by the ruling Communist Party to outline economic and military plans for China. This year’s gatherings are remarkable since later in the year President Xi Jinping is expected to continue his leadership of the country for an unprecedented third term.\nTaiwan has been administering itself since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s, during which defeated nationalist forces retreated to the island. Taipei claims to be representing the will of the Chinese people, but most of the world recognizes Beijing in that role under the so-called “One China policy.”\nTensions over Taiwan have been ramping up over the past few years amid new arms sales by Washington and visits of semi-official American delegations, which Beijing sees as undermining its claims to the island. China has ramped up military activities around Taiwan, stating that it was acting to balance similar moves by the US.\nLately, there was speculation in Western media that Beijing may attempt to take over the island by force amid the security crisis in Europe caused by Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Beijing refused to condemn Moscow for its offensive and accused the US and NATO of paving the way for hostilities by ignoring Russian national security concerns. Moscow said its attack was necessary to curb threats emanating from Ukraine due to NATO’s creeping expansion into Ukraine.\nOther parts of Li’s remarks, which covered Beijing’s relationship with Hong Kong, were notably devoid of condemnations of foreign meddling, which have been common in speeches by Chinese officials since the mass anti-government protests and rioting that gripped the autonomous city in 2019. He instead focused on the potential of economic growth for Hong Kong, Macao and other Chinese cities in the Greater Bay Area.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_eu-chief-signals-major-shift-in-migration-policy-with-increased-focus-on-deportations/content_340.html": "EU Chief Signals Major Shift in Migration Policy with Increased Focus on Deportations\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU could “draw lessons” from Italy’s controversial policy of processing migrants offshore in Albania, as leaders of the 27 member states convene for a crucial EU summit centred on migration challenges.\nIn a comprehensive letter addressed to EU leaders ahead of the Brussels summit, von der Leyen revealed that the EU’s executive arm would be putting forward new legislative proposals aimed at substantially increasing deportations of migrants who have entered member states irregularly.\nItalian-Albanian Agreement Takes Effect\nThe implementation of Italy’s ground breaking agreement with Albania commenced earlier this week, marking a significant shift in European migration management. The initial transfer involved sixteen men to a processing centre in the Albanian port of Shengjin. However, complications emerged shortly after their arrival when it was discovered that four of the individuals required immediate return to Italy—two were identified as minors, whilst the other two were found to have medical vulnerabilities that precluded their processing in Albania.\nThe Italian-Albanian arrangement, which has come at a considerable cost of approximately €650m (£547m), has faced numerous setbacks and delays. Originally scheduled to commence operations last spring, the processing centres, wholly funded by the Italian government and operating under Italian jurisdiction, will serve as temporary accommodation for migrants whilst their asylum applications are reviewed by Italian authorities. The scheme explicitly excludes several categories of individuals, including pregnant women, children, and those deemed vulnerable.\nWider European Response\nThe initiative has sparked considerable interest across the European Union, with several member states actively exploring similar arrangements with third countries. In a notable development, the Dutch government disclosed on Wednesday that it was actively considering a proposal to relocate rejected asylum seekers to Uganda.\nVon der Leyen’s focus on migration appears to be a direct response to mounting pressure from across the continent. In her detailed communication to member states, she highlighted a stark statistic: the current return rate for irregular migrants from EU countries stands at merely 20%, indicating that four-fifths of individuals ordered to leave EU territory successfully evade deportation.\nPolitical Backlash and Support\nThe Italian scheme has drawn sharp criticism from various quarters. Riccardo Magi, representing the left-wing +Europa party, denounced the arrangement as “cruel, useless and expensive.” The humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders expressed grave concerns, suggesting the scheme would likely result in “further harm and violation of human rights.” Local civil rights campaigners in Albania made their opposition visible, displaying a poignant banner declaring “The European dream ends here” near the newly established processing centre in Shengjin.\nHowever, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, leading the right-wing government, has steadfastly defended the initiative. Addressing Parliament, she characterised the plan as “a new, courageous, unprecedented path” that she maintained “perfectly reflected the European spirit.”\nBroader European Context\nThe implementation and outcomes of the Albania agreement are being closely monitored by numerous EU member states, many of which have recently adopted more stringent approaches to migration in response to rising support for far-right political movements. Recent developments across Europe illustrate this trend:\n– Germany has reinstated checks along its land borders\n– France has begun exploring more restrictive immigration legislation\n– Poland has announced plans to temporarily suspend asylum rights for border crossers\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk justified the controversial measure as necessary to prevent Belarus from “destabilising” Poland through the facilitation of large-scale migration flows.\nRecent Incidents Fuelling Policy Shifts\nRecent tragic events in France and Germany have intensified calls for stricter immigration enforcement. In Solingen, Germany, a Syrian failed asylum seeker committed a fatal attack, resulting in three deaths. Similarly, near Paris, a Moroccan national was responsible for the murder of a young student. Both perpetrators had been subject to unenforced expulsion orders, highlighting systemic challenges in implementing deportation decisions.\nContinental Coordination\nIn a demonstration of growing consensus on the need for reform, fifteen member states have endorsed a joint proposal spearheaded by Austria and the Netherlands, aimed at enhancing the “efficiency” of the EU’s deportation mechanisms. This collaborative approach suggests a broader shift towards more coordinated and stringent migration management across the continent.\nVon der Leyen’s proposal emphasises the importance of mutual recognition of deportation decisions among member states, arguing that this would prevent migrants from exploiting systematic vulnerabilities to avoid return orders issued in one country by relocating to another EU member state.\nThis comprehensive reform initiative represents one of the most significant shifts in EU migration policy in recent years, potentially setting the stage for a fundamental transformation in how the bloc manages irregular migration and processes asylum claims.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_investors-sentiment-shifts-contrasting-fortunes-in-europe-and-the-us/content_827.html": "Investors’ Sentiment Shifts – Contrasting Fortunes in Europe and the US\nIn the realm of financial markets, sentiment can sway like a pendulum, and currently, the pendulum is swinging with stark contrasts on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Investors are increasingly casting skeptical glances toward Europe’s economic prospects, revealing a growing divergence from the prevailing optimism about a “soft landing” in the United States.\n**Euro’s Slide and Stalling European Shares**\nOver the past couple of weeks, notable shifts have marked the changing sentiment. The Euro has weakened in comparison to the US Dollar, and the upward trajectory of European share prices earlier this year has seemingly hit a plateau. Meanwhile, German government bonds, often seen as a safe haven during turbulent times, have been gaining value.\nThese fluctuations in market indicators are sending a clear message – fund managers are gaining confidence in the belief that economic indicators within the Eurozone are exhibiting signs of weakening. This trend is fueled by the backdrop of increasing borrowing costs. On the other side of the ocean, the US economy appears to be displaying resilience, even in the face of its most stringent interest rate environment in over two decades.\n**Differing Economic Data: US Resilience and European Struggles**\nA closer look at recent economic data paints an even more divergent picture. The US economy outperformed expectations by growing at an annualized rate of 2.4% in the second quarter. The preferred inflation indicator of the US Federal Reserve cooled more than anticipated in June, bolstering hopes that the rate-raising cycle might be drawing to a close. In stark contrast, Europe finds itself teetering on the brink of a possible recession. Notably, services inflation in the Eurozone skyrocketed to a record 5.6% in July.\nThis stark contrast stems from a multitude of factors, including the impact of geopolitical events. Analysts highlight that the US interest rate hikes have been more effective in curbing inflation than their European counterparts. Furthermore, the ongoing geopolitical upheaval caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has substantially disrupted food and energy supplies in Europe, contributing to the higher inflation rates.\n**European Equities’ Rollercoaster Ride**\nThe year commenced with an unexpected surge in European equity markets, confounding predictions of a decline. However, this momentum has hit a snag as the second-quarter earnings season unfolds. Companies listed on the Stoxx Europe 600 index are poised to deliver their steepest drop in quarterly profits since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. In comparison, US companies within the S&P 500 have reported a much milder year-on-year decline in earnings per share.\nThis shift has led to a widening gap between European and US share prices. The S&P 500 has enjoyed a nearly 20% surge this year, partly due to the buoyancy surrounding artificial intelligence, a sector predominantly led by US firms.\n**Conflicting Views on Economic Outlook**\nTim Murray, a multi-asset capital markets strategist at T Rowe Price, encapsulated this sentiment: “If you look at the equity valuations, they’ve been much higher in the US than in Europe and the rest of the world for quite some time. There was a little bit of narrowing, and now that’s widened back out. In the US, the narrative is we’re going to get the soft landing and avoid recession, whereas I think in Europe, there’s still a lot of doubt about that.”\nThis skepticism is echoed across currency and bond markets. The Euro has lost 2.6% of its value against the US Dollar since mid-July. Simultaneously, the gap between US and German 10-year government bond yields has reached its highest point this year. The appeal of European bonds, especially German Bunds, as a safe haven during a potential European recession is evident.\n**Investors’ Defensive Maneuvers**\nKevin Thozet, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac, shed light on this shift, noting that Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, seems to be facing the brunt of economic weakening. In response, investors have diverted their focus toward German government bonds, seeking refuge should a full-fledged European recession unfold.\nThe trend is also reflected in the choices made by non-US investors. Non-US investors have divested approximately $50 billion in US Treasuries since the year’s commencement. In contrast, German Bunds have attracted nearly $4 billion in net inflows from non-eurozone investors over the same period.\n**Optimism Amidst Challenges: The Case of UK Government Bonds**\nThe appeal of government bonds isn’t confined to Germany. UK government bonds have garnered investor interest in recent weeks. The anticipation of assertive rate hikes by the Bank of England to address the UK’s significant inflation problem has driven this interest. The perception is that these bonds could provide a haven in times of economic uncertainty and potential recession.\n**Corporate Bond Pricing: A Reflection of Market Confidence**\nThe pricing of corporate bonds further underscores the growing optimism toward the US compared to Europe. Lowly-rated US companies issuing bonds are experiencing a premium near its lowest point in 16 months. In contrast, Eurozone junk bond spreads remain comparatively broader, reflecting a more cautious stance among investors.\n**Final Thoughts: A Tale of Two Economies**\nIn summation, the financial arena is currently witnessing a compelling narrative of divergence between Europe and the US. Investors are increasingly expressing concerns about Europe’s economic trajectory, influenced by weakening indicators and apprehensions about policy decisions. On the other hand, the US economy stands on the precipice of a “soft landing,” exhibiting robust growth and controlled inflation. As the year unfolds, these distinct trends will continue shaping investor strategies and market dynamics on both sides of the Atlantic.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_heat-pumps-too-noisy-for-parliament/content_454.html": "Heat pumps too noisy for Parliament\nParliament’s Heat Pump Initiative Halted Following Noise Concerns\nLabour Party Faces Accusations of Double Standards as Power Supply and Acoustic Issues Present ‘Significant Risk’\nThe Houses of Parliament’s ambitious scheme to transition to heat pump technology has been temporarily suspended amidst mounting concerns regarding noise emissions and operational efficiency, The Telegraph has learnt through exclusive investigation.\nAccording to records obtained through Freedom of Information requests, whilst three air source heat pumps have been successfully installed within the House of Commons estate, no further installations have proceeded since 2022. This revelation comes at a particularly sensitive moment for the Government’s green energy agenda.\nA comprehensive feasibility study—exclusively obtained by The Telegraph—examining the potential installation of additional heat pump infrastructure within Portcullis House, the modern parliamentary office complex, has highlighted considerable reservations regarding both acoustic impact and electrical supply capabilities. The findings present a significant challenge to the broader governmental push towards sustainable heating solutions.\nThe situation has catalysed fresh controversy for the Labour Party, with opposition members suggesting the difficulties encountered within Parliament itself serve as demonstrable evidence that heat pumps may not be suitable for widespread residential deployment. This stands in stark contrast to the Government’s continued advocacy for domestic installations.\nRichard Tice, representing the Reform Party, offered a particularly pointed critique: “The Parliamentary estate’s experience with just three heat pumps has been fraught with difficulties, generating consistent complaints about excessive electricity consumption and noise pollution. Yet remarkably, Labour continues to advocate for nationwide adoption whilst appearing reluctant to embrace the technology within their own workplace environment.”\nTice further emphasised the disconnect between political leadership and public sentiment: “This situation perfectly exemplifies the growing chasm between our political establishment and the everyday experiences of British citizens.”\nConservative MP Greg Smith provided additional commentary, stating: “This serves as an unequivocal demonstration of heat pumps’ practical limitations. Nevertheless, Labour persists in attempting to mandate their adoption, potentially leaving citizens both financially strained and thermally uncomfortable.”\nThe practical implications of these challenges have become increasingly apparent within Parliament itself. One parliamentary staff member, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that Portcullis House consistently struggles to maintain comfortable working temperatures, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among employees regarding their working environment.\nThe Parliamentary estate’s journey with heat pump technology began in 2015 with its inaugural installation, followed by two additional units in 2022. However, the most recent feasibility study, conducted by renowned energy consultancy firm Troup Bywaters and Anders in July 2024, has raised serious concerns despite recommending air source heat pumps (ASHPs) for Portcullis House.\nThe consultants’ report explicitly highlighted power supply and acoustic considerations as “the most prominent risk factors requiring immediate attention.” Their assessment continued with a notable caveat: “Whilst we maintain our recommendation for ASHPs, we must emphasise the need for careful consideration and strongly advocate for the exploration of alternative power solutions.”\nInterestingly, specific details regarding the location of both existing and planned heat pump installations were withheld from public disclosure, with House of Commons officials citing national security considerations as the primary justification for this information restriction.\nThe controversy surrounding heat pump technology extends well beyond Parliament’s walls. Homeowners across the country have consistently raised concerns regarding operational noise levels, which can reach up to 60 decibels—comparable to normal conversation levels—and the substantial space requirements for installation.\nLabour’s decision in November of the previous year to relax planning regulations for heat pumps, permitting installation within one metre of neighbouring properties, has added another layer of complexity to the ongoing debate.\nThe Government maintains ambitious targets for heat pump adoption, aiming to achieve 600,000 annual installations by 2028. To facilitate this objective, they have implemented controversial measures including a “boiler tax” penalising installers who fail to meet specified targets.\nThe financial implications for homeowners remain significant, with heat pump systems typically commanding approximately £10,000 without subsidies, presenting a stark contrast to traditional gas boilers costing around £3,000.\nA spokesperson for the UK Parliament provided an official response: “The UK Parliament maintains an unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability. We continuously evaluate opportunities to reduce both operational costs and carbon emissions across the Parliamentary Estate, subjecting all processes to regular review and assessment.”\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero defended their position through their spokesperson: “Our primary focus remains on fostering public support as we progress towards our ambition of establishing Britain as a clean energy superpower. This strategy encompasses ensuring energy security, protecting consumer interests, and generating employment opportunities.”\nThe spokesperson further highlighted the potential benefits: “Heat pumps demonstrate threefold efficiency improvements compared to conventional gas boilers. Through our £7,500 grant scheme, we’re working to enhance accessibility and affordability for households. When operated effectively with smart tariffs, families can achieve approximate annual savings of £100 compared to traditional gas heating systems.”\nThis ongoing situation continues to highlight the complex challenges facing Britain’s transition to sustainable heating technologies, particularly as practical implementation issues emerge within the very heart of British democracy.\nComment\nThe vast majority of UK homes are not suitable for Heat Pumps, they are either no insulated enough, or they are too close to neighbouring properties that causes noise pollution. Complaints about noise from heat pumps are increasing exponentially and innocent people are being sold these contraptions with no advice about the huge expense of insulating their homes and upgrading their radiators, installing under-floor heating and other changes required to upgrade their system to the degree that would be required for them to have the remotest chance of being warm.\nOnce they have spent thousands that they frequently cannot afford, to install a heat-pump, they are then told that they need to spend thousands more to make it work, that’s if it does.\nOn top of this, one of the fastest growing domestic crimes is heat-pump theft!",

The effects of a Toxic relationship’ can completely destroy one’s self-esteem, confidence and even the will to live.\nIt all creeps up so very slowly, normally with flattery, open displays of affection and public seduction, this is how it is so very often missed by those closest to the victim, who may actually be envious of the attention the victim is getting. However, beneath the surface, there is a festering emotional and very sinister agenda.\nThe coercive abuser begins by seizing on every opportunity to find fault with the victim, their actions, their behaviour, their friends and their families. The exploit those situations to gradually alienate them, leaving the victim increasingly alone.\nGradually, it can all seem normal to the victim, apart from the fact that they cannot do right for doing wrong, they eventually begin to question themselves, actually believing that they may be at fault. The more they believe that they may be to blame, the more they are subjugated to the will of the abuser and that is the slippery road to an emotional, psychological and even physical prison sentence.\nI would highly recommend reading through this checklist, courtesy of ‘Living Without Abuse’\nCheck off the symptoms of abusive or manipulative partners.\nRead over the following bullets. Answer honestly and without justifying your partner’s behaviour (don’t say “Well, she’s not like that ALL the time,” or “It’s only happened once or twice–” if it happened at all it’s an issue!). Simply answer yes or no. Even 3-4 yes’s mean it is time to get out and get with someone who treats you with the respect you deserve. Does your partner:\n- Embarrass or make fun of you in front of your friends or family?\n- Put down your accomplishments or discourage your goals?\n- Make you feel like you are unable to make decisions?\n- Use intimidation, guilt, or threats to gain compliance?\n- Tell you what you can and cannot wear?\n- Tell you what you need to do with your hair?\n- Tell you that you are nothing without them, or they are nothing without you?\n- Treat you roughly without your consent – grab, push, pinch, shove or hit you?\n- Call you several times a night or show up to make sure you are where you said you would be?\n- Use drugs or alcohol as an excuse for saying hurtful things or abusing you?\n- Blame you for how they feel or act?\n- Pressure you sexually for things you aren’t ready for?\n- Make you feel like there “is no way out” of the relationship?\n- Prevent you from doing things you want – like spending time with your friends or family?\n- Try to keep you from leaving after a fight or leave you somewhere after a fight to “teach you a lesson”?\nKeep your ear to the ground for troubling stories or rumours about your partner.\nHearing multiple versions of the “same” story? Do their friends tell you things about your partner that you’ve never heard, or that your partner flat-out contradicted? Half-truths and selective memories often mean they’re shaping the “truth” for you. This is a major red-flag for manipulation, and you best get to the bottom of it.\n- When you’re being controlled or manipulated, it’s usually through half-truths or omissions, not outright lies. There’s just enough weirdness to make you stop and think, but not quite enough to get you to re-evaluate the entire relationship.\n- If this happens more than once, STOP and remind yourself that this isn’t the first time you’ve had this reaction. Start analyzing discrepancies between what your spouse/significant other said and what your friends say. If there are a lot of them, call him/her out on them. If his/her reaction or answers don’t satisfy, it is time to re-evaluate in a major way.\nKeep your friends close — especially if he/she is trying to cut them out of the picture.\nCutting you off from the friends and family helps her/him gain dominance over you. Then, because they are so terrible, they make you think that it’s your decision to leave them. If they’re constantly talking behind your friends’ backs, making jokes about your family, or making a big scene every time you leave to be with pals, then screw that relationship and move on.\n- Controlling people love to make tension and drama. They’ll stir up the pot by pushing people, acting passive aggressive, and initiating conflict. Then, like “innocent” little children by a broken lamp, they’ll put their hands up and blame it on your friends and family.\n- It’s much easier for him/her to control you when you’ve decided there is too much tension between your loved ones and your mate, and soon, you have no one but her/him to turn to.\nShow excessive jealousy or possessiveness the door.\nIf your partner is protective of you, that’s sweet. If they’re bizarrely over-protective, it’s scary and super annoying. Does she/he interrogate you if you aren’t home exactly on time, or if you go out for any reason? Do they question you too intensely about why you were talking to another person? Does your partner tell you that you don’t care about them if you spend time with a friend?\nA little jealousy is normal, even cute. But it shouldn’t affect your daily relationships. Jealousy means they don’t trust you. And if they don’t trust you, they aren’t worth dating.\nWalk out on double standards and can’t-win situations.\nIt’s okay for your partner to be two hours late, but you get attacked if you’re five minutes off schedule? It’s “perfectly innocent” when they flirt but you’re accused of infidelity for saying “Hey?” If you save money then you’re being too stingy, if you spend it you’re careless with money. No matter what you do, you are at fault — and this kind of bullshit can’t stand.\nThese are just games meant to screw with your head, and are common in controlling-manipulative relationships. You’re not going to win, so don’t play the game. Get out!\nIgnore their sweet, fake attempts to make nice.\nHe/she does something that is totally unacceptable then asks your forgiveness. They tell you they realize they were wrong, and promises to change. They seem utterly sincere and convincing — and this is what makes them such master manipulators. They’re using you — the compassionate, kind one– and turning your kindness against you. Watch for the bad behavior to resume as soon as they believe they have you hooked and complacent again. Then watch as they apologize again, rinse, and repeat.\n- At this point he/she may even tearfully say she/he wants your help to change, particularly if you have let them know that you will not tolerate such things again. They may bring you lavish gifts and attempt to sweep you off your feet again. It’s up to you whether to give them a second chance or not. If they betray your trust again, though, cut through the crap and cut them out of your life.\nCoercive behaviour can frequently become physical, although the damning effects of psychological abuse do go unnoticed.\nHere are some statistics courtesy of the ‘Living without abuse’ website visit them HERE\nStatistics\nDomestic abuse\n- Will affect 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men in their lifetime\n- Leads to, on average, two women being murdered each week and 30 men per year\n- Accounts for 16% of all violent crime (Source: Crime in England and Wales 04/05 report), however it is still the violent crime least likely to be reported to the police\n- Has more repeat victims than any other crime (on average there will have been 35 assaults before a victim calls the police)\n- Is the single most quoted reason for becoming homeless (Shelter, 2002)\n- In 2010 the Forced Marriage Unit responded to 1735 reports of possible Forced Marriages.\nIn addition, approximately 400 people commit suicide each year who have attended hospital for domestic abuse injuries in the previous six months, 200 of these attend hospital on the day they go on to commit suicide\nThe cost of domestic abuse\nIt has been estimated that domestic abuse costs the public £23 billion per annum. This includes the cost to the criminal justice system, to the health service, to social care and to housing. It is widely accepted however that this figure is an under-estimate as there are so many costs that can not be measured.\nThe Home Office estimates that each domestic abuse murder costs the country just over £1 million and totals £112 million per annum.\nFurther statistical information is available from the British Crime Survey Statistical Bulletin.\nFor those in need of help, call LWA directly on their Outreach number 0808 80 200 28",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_britain-could-soon-become-the-capital-gains-tax-hotspot-of-europe/content_300.html": "Britain could soon become the capital gains tax hotspot of Europe\nThe government has not ruled out increases of more than 30pc, Rachel Reeves could saddle Britain with some of the highest capital gains tax (CGT) bills in Europe if she follows through with tipped Budget reforms.\nRumours swirled this month that Reeves could align capital gains with income tax, meaning rates could rise up to 45pc for the highest earners. Such a move would catapult the UK from 14th to first in the European rankings for CGT charges on non-property assets, overtaking Denmark at the top of the charts.\nThe Nordic country currently leads the way, charging up to 42pc on asset sales. It is followed by Norway (37.8pc), France and Finland (34pc), and Ireland (33pc).\nThis week the Treasury dismissed a story that suggested Labour had modelled raising the rate to 39pc, however, the source did not deny it could be increased to more than 30pc. Even at a rate of 30pc, the UK would have the seventh highest capital gains tax in Europe.\nAs it stands, higher-rate and additional taxpayers are charged 24pc on profits made from the sale of second properties and 20pc for other assets. Basic rate taxpayers pay 18pc and 10pc respectively.\nThe prospect of the UK having one of the highest CGT rates would not just put the brakes on overseas investment, it would be catastrophic for the economy.\nA number of countries including Luxembourg, Denmark and Hungary already charge CGT at the same level as income tax, while Belgium and Switzerland are CGT-free.\nLandlords and investors are already scrambling to sell in anticipation of a CGT shake-up in Labour’s self-labelled “painful” Budget on October 30.\nIn the last few weeks and month, the market has been flooded with ex-BTL properties, as Landlords bail out en-mass, causing the number of properties available for rent to plummet.\nThe looming threat of higher tax bills saw HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) pocket a record £197m in August, with tax advisers reporting a surge in inquiries from middle-class investors panicking about the risk of higher bills.\nThe Government may even cut the remainder of the annual £3,000 tax-free allowance for investment profits, which has already faced a series of drastic cuts in the past two years, with the Tories lowering it from £12,000.\nAs I have previously said, I can’t think of anything more obtuse, considering that there are over 670,000 empty properties in England alone, most of which are unfit for use, or derelict and would only be brought back into use by everyday people like you and I, but rather than offer additional incentives, albeit subject to bringing these properties up to a minimum standard, they have made the entire process of renovating 2 & 3 bed family homes unattractive, especially as there is already a 3% stamp duty surcharge, which was introduced by the fiscal wizard, George Osborne.\nLet’s put party politics to the side for one moment and focus on the economy, it is clearly obvious that this administration has absolutely no clue, they are missing the simplest and most obvious formula in generating revenue, the fast the rotation of money in the economy, the smaller the portion that is required to fill the coffers and conversely, the slower the rotation, the large the slice.\nWhilst I am personally against overseas investors being able to park their money in our properties, taking them out of circulation and leaving them empty, I fervently believe that with suitable tax incentives, these investors could be encouraged to invest into building starter homes and social housing on the vast number of brownfield sites across the country which have the capacity for between 1.2 and 2 million homes, or we could just leave it to Angela Rayner.",

In his first major political intervention since leaving office disgraced by the EU referendum result, the former Conservative Prime Minister has provoked outrage amongst Brexiteers by calling for closer UK ties with Brussels.\nIn an exclusive newspaper interview, Cameron argued that Britain now needs to work more harmoniously with the EU on foreign and defence policies. Describing the bloc as a “friend, neighbour and partner”, he effectively denounced the confrontational stance adopted by some Eurosceptic Tories. Predictably, his comments have gone down like a cup of cold sick amongst the most hardcore Leavers.\nCameron’s Dubious Return to the Limelight\nCameron’s demand for cooperation has principally been driven by a desire to salvage his own tattered reputation. Having failed to persuade voters to back Remain in 2016 and subsequently resigning as PM, he is now deeply unpopular with swathes of Conservatives who backed Brexit. This latest media appearance represents a blatant attempt to curry favour once more with his former EU allies and the pro-Brussels establishment.\nThe fierce backlash provoked demonstrates how the wounds from the polarising Brexit referendum remain raw for many Leavers. In their eyes, Cameron betrayed the Eurosceptic wing of his party by holding a vote he was confident would back Remain. The fact he then refused to implement the public’s will to Leave only compounds feelings of distrust toward his motives.\nHardline Tories Resist Closer EU Alignment\nFor ardent Brexiteers like Belinda de Lucy, formerly of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, Cameron’s call for cooperation is a smokescreen for gradually eroding British sovereignty. De Lucy argues that while Cameron claims shared policy interests justify partnerships in areas like Ukraine, his real goal is advancing personal ambitions on the global stage.\nIn her eyes, the UK must maintain clear red lines in dealings with Brussels. Providing any openings will allow EU figures to relentlessly push for further integration across trade, regulation and migration. This perspective reflects an underlying suspicion of EU motives that endures within sections of the Conservative right.\nManaging Divisions in Rishi Sunak’s Cabinet\nCameron’s comments also create an unwelcome distraction for current PM Rishi Sunak as he attempts to unite his warring party and turn around dire polling. Sunak has already unnerved Eurosceptics by bringing arch-Remainer Greg Hands into cabinet as Trade Secretary. The emergence of Cameron’s call for alignment compounds fears that the government plans to edge closer to EU structures over time.\nAs political commentators note, Sunak can ill-afford to reopen the toxic Brexit divisions at this precarious moment. Hardline Leavers are likely to treat Cameron’s intervention as proof that senior Tories still dream of eventual EU reintegration. With the Conservatives trailing Labour heavily, such internal chaos seems politically suicidal.\nCan the Conservatives Ever Overcome Brexit Divides?\nThe fury sparked by Cameron underlines the intense challenge facing Conservative leaders when it comes to reconciling party factions over Europe. Until they can finally settle the Brexit question, votes will continue seeping to nationalist rivals like Reform UK able to exploit the ongoing bitterness.\nFor now, most Tory Leavers seem unwilling to stomach any softening towards Brussels. With trust in EU motives severely depleted after years of acrimonious negotiations, pragmatists like Cameron face being ignored. The debate has become so ideologically charged that his reasonable call for cooperation is seen as treason by Eurosceptics.\nConclusion\n• Former British PM David Cameron has controversially argued that the UK should seek closer ties with the EU on foreign policy and defence matters.\n• Cameron says Britain needs to cooperate more with Brussels and has described the EU as a “friend, neighbour and partner”.\n• His comments have sparked fury among pro-Brexit Conservatives who warn he risks reigniting bitter divisions.\n• Cameron likely wants to rehabilitate his reputation after being damaged by Brexit vote.\n• He specifically argues for alignment on security and defence policy due to shared European interests.\n• Ardent Brexiteer Belinda de Lucy cautions EU will exploit openings to erode British sovereignty over time.\n• De Lucy says Cameron is motivated by desire to please pro-EU friends and secure personal international acclaim.\n• Cameron’s call risks inflaming tensions within the divided Conservative Party led by Rishi Sunak.\n• Reopening Brexit rifts seems politically hazardous with Conservatives trailing heavily in polls.\n• Cameron’s plea for cooperation faces being ignored as trust in EU severely depleted among Brexiteers.\n• Until Conservatives resolve Brexit divides, they will keep losing votes to rival parties.\n• For many Leavers, Cameron failed test posed by Brexit vote and can’t be redeemed.\n• Cameron’s EU vision seems destined to widen Tory splits rather than healing Brexit rifts.\nWhile elements of Cameron’s argument for UK-EU cooperation contain logic, the instant backlash it received highlights such visions remain fantasy whilst Conservative divisions persist. By blundering back into this political minefield, critics feel Cameron has only succeeded in widening splits within Tory ranks. Until they can heal enduring Brexit tensions, the Conservatives seem destined for the wilderness.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-conspiracy-of-silence-surrounding-labours-covert-wealth-tax-strategy/content_1276.html": "The ‘Conspiracy of Silence’ Surrounding Labour’s Covert Wealth Tax Strategy\nGlaring Omissions in Party Manifesto Falsely Suggest Cost-Free Policy Implementation\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of the Labour manifesto is not what it contains, but rather what it conspicuously omits.\nSir Keir Starmer, the Leader of the Labour Party, has categorically ruled out increases in several major taxes: income tax, National Insurance contributions, Value Added Tax (VAT), and the headline rate of corporation tax. This stance mirrors that of the current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, in what Paul Johnson, the esteemed director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has aptly dubbed a “tax lock arms race”.\nHowever, the question that looms large in Johnson’s mind – and indeed, in the minds of many economic analysts – is which taxes Starmer does intend to raise, should Labour secure victory in the forthcoming general election.\nThe IFS chief has not minced words in his critique of both major parties, accusing them of engaging in a “conspiracy of silence” regarding the true magnitude of the economic and fiscal challenges that await the next government, regardless of its political affiliation.\nJohnson asserts that the victorious party, upon assuming power, will face an unenviable trilemma: they must choose between raising taxes beyond the levels outlined in their manifestos, implementing further cuts to public spending, or increasing government borrowing. Given current polling trends and political forecasts, it appears increasingly likely that it will be Starmer grappling with this thorny issue come 5 July.\nWith characteristic frankness, Johnson states that it would be “a considerable surprise” if taxes were not raised over the course of the next five-year parliamentary term.\nA perfect storm of fiscal pressures is brewing, which will likely force Starmer’s hand, according to the IFS’s analysis. These include enormous public spending demands, a commitment to reduce the national debt, spiralling debt interest payments, sluggish economic growth, and the demographic challenge posed by an ageing and increasingly infirm population.\nYet, even setting aside these formidable challenges, both major parties’ manifestos contain glaring gaps, as highlighted by the think tank. Labour and the Conservatives have both pledged to reverse a decade-long trend of increasing NHS waiting times, but neither has provided a clear roadmap for achieving this ambitious goal. Labour has additionally committed to formulating a strategy to reduce child poverty.\nJohnson, speaking at a press conference on Monday, did not mince words: “Promises like these appear to imply all this can be delivered for free. It can’t.”\nGiven Starmer’s categorical rejection of increases to several major taxes, it is natural to speculate on where he might find the additional revenue required to fund these ambitious plans. Through a process of elimination, it seems increasingly likely that a raid on the wealthy may be on the horizon.\nHelen Miller, the deputy director and head of tax at the IFS, suggests that wealth levies such as capital gains and inheritance taxes are among the most obvious targets for a Labour government seeking to boost revenue.\n“If they want big money and they have ruled out the big taxes, then looking at capital incomes would be the place they would look,” Miller explains. “They are perhaps the most obvious in the sense that if you want something big and chunky, that’s where you’d turn.”\nA clear target in this regard is capital gains tax (CGT). Currently, CGT contributes £15.2 billion annually to the Treasury’s coffers and is levied on profits from the sale of assets, including shares, businesses, and property that is not a primary residence.\nAt present, capital gains are taxed at lower rates than other forms of income, and there is growing speculation that this disparity could be addressed under a Labour government.\nHowever, Miller cautions that more radical reform may be necessary to generate significant additional revenue: “If they wanted serious money – I’m talking about billions as opposed to just rounding errors – then they would have to actually start looking at serious reform.”\nSuch reform could potentially involve broadening the tax base by increasing the number of people subject to CGT and eliminating various existing reliefs.\nWhile Starmer has explicitly ruled out introducing CGT on the sale of people’s primary homes, a new Labour government could explore ways to broaden the tax in other areas, Miller suggests.\nLabour has consistently pledged not to “raise taxes on working people”, but closer scrutiny of this promise reveals that it specifically refers to income earned from work, leaving the door open for potential increases in taxes on investment gains.\nAccording to a memo obtained by The Guardian, Labour estimates that raising CGT rates could generate an additional £8 billion for the public purse.\n“We are starting from ground zero with our public services and infrastructure,” a senior Labour source confided to the newspaper. “We have to show we are serious about borrowing and raising revenue from taxes if investors are going to walk in step with us. These measures are part of unlocking wealth and putting it to work.”\nAnother potential avenue for increasing revenue could be through reform of inheritance tax, which currently contributes £7.5 billion annually to government coffers. According to The Guardian, a key measure under consideration by Labour is a clampdown on existing reliefs.\nCurrent inheritance tax rules allow individuals to gift farmland tax-free upon death and to pass on certain business assets with 100% relief. Additionally, pension death benefits are typically exempt from inheritance tax. These are precisely the types of tax breaks that Starmer may seek to target.\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has publicly denied that Labour has plans to raise taxes in an anticipated autumn budget, should the party win the general election. However, reports suggest that draft documents and analyses of revenue-raising policies have been circulating among senior party officials.\nYet, even if Labour does tighten the regime on inheritance taxes and launch a raid on investment gains, it may not be sufficient to meet the party’s ambitious spending plans and address the fiscal challenges facing the country.\nAs Johnson points out, “You can do some things with inheritance tax, some things on capital gains tax and some things with other taxes; you can start to raise noticeable amounts, but not really, really big ones.”\nThe substantial cost of Labour’s proposed policies, combined with the growing burden of both national debt and an ageing and increasingly ill population, means that even more groups could potentially find themselves in the crosshairs for higher taxes.\nJohnson believes that motorists could eventually be hit with road pricing – a novel and potentially controversial new tax.\nFuel duty has been frozen at 2010 levels for the past 14 years, creating an increasingly large fiscal hole for future governments. Simultaneously, the ongoing shift towards electric vehicles means that this revenue stream is set to decline further, Johnson warns.\n“Even if we manage to raise fuel duty in line with inflation for the first time in 15 years, [fuel duty revenue] is still going to go down and down as we move to electric cars. We need a government that is going to deal with road pricing, or some other way of getting some of that revenue back,” Johnson argues.\nSpeaking at a Bloomberg debate on Monday, shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds rejected accusations that Labour’s economic plans were “fanciful”. He asserted, “The answer has got to be breaking out of this low growth, high tax, poor services doom.”\nOne of Labour’s key pledges is to secure “the highest sustained growth in the G7”. If the economy grows more rapidly than current forecasts suggest, it would undoubtedly ease the strain on the public finances. Labour’s plans to reform the planning system could contribute positively to this goal, Johnson acknowledges.\nHowever, the IFS chief warns that the party’s net zero ambitions may clash with its growth objectives. He argues that proposing to allocate £5 billion annually to green projects “is not the same priority as growth”.\nJohnson contends that a new government genuinely prioritising growth would be more likely to invest in transport infrastructure or skills development, rather than focusing primarily on green initiatives.\nEven if economic growth does exceed current forecasts, Johnson cautions that this would merely allow a new government to avoid planned cuts in public spending.\n“It will not create a spending bonanza of any kind,” he warns.\nAs the general election approaches, the British public and economic analysts alike will be keenly watching for any further details or leaks regarding Labour’s fiscal plans. The tension between ambitious spending promises and the need for fiscal responsibility is likely to remain a key point of debate in the coming months. Whether Starmer and his team can successfully navigate this complex economic landscape while maintaining public trust and support remains to be seen.",

Drafted in the aftermath of World War II to deal with displacement in Europe, the 1951 Convention consolidated previous international agreements and established a universal definition and standards for the treatment of refugees. The 1967 Protocol expanded the Convention’s scope beyond Europe and shed the time limits in the original document. Together, these landmark treaties lay out the rights of refugees and legal obligations of States to protect them. Since entering into force in 1954 and 1968 respectively, they have been acceded to by 149 States and remain the cornerstone of the international regime protecting refugees today.\nBackground\nThe 1951 Refugee Convention was drafted under the auspices of the newly formed United Nations in the years following World War II. Earlier international agreements to protect refugees and displaced persons were limited in scope to dealing with particular refugee situations. The drafters sought to create a more comprehensive agreement that would be universal in coverage. However, negotiations reflected the realities of the early Cold War period. Western countries wanted to limit coverage to protecting people fleeing communist regimes in Europe, while communist bloc countries opposed any agreement. As a compromise, the 1951 Convention included temporary limitations confining it to protecting European refugees displaced before 1951.\nDespite the geographic and time boundaries, the 1951 Convention represented a major breakthrough in establishing international standards for the treatment of refugees. The new treaty consolidated previous agreements and introduced important novel elements. Most significantly, Article 1 created a universal definition of a refugee as someone outside of their country of origin with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group. This established for the first time a single international legal definition of a refugee. While initially limited, this definition enabled future expansion once the temporal and regional restrictions were lifted.\nBasic Framework and Key Provisions\nThe 1951 Convention consists of 46 Articles setting out the basic rights of refugees and obligations of States. It begins with the critical refugee definition in Article 1, which provides the cornerstone for determining who merits international protection. Article 1 also outlines cessation clauses describing when refugee status ends, and exclusion clauses preventing serious criminals from receiving protection. Article 2 sets out the general responsibilities of refugees towards host governments.\nArticles 3-34 enumerate various economic, social, and legal rights to which refugees are entitled. These include rights to education, employment, identity papers, travel documents, and freedom of movement. Refugees are to receive at least as favorable treatment as other non-citizens and sometimes the same rights as citizens. The Convention also incorporates due process protections against expulsion, non-penalization for illegal entry, and non-refoulement or return to danger. This constitutes the most comprehensive codification of refugee rights in international law at the time.\nIn addition to articulating refugee rights, the Convention lays out important obligations for States. Article 35 requires governments to cooperate with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in ensuring implementation and monitoring of Convention provisions. This gave UNHCR, established the year before, supervisory responsibility over the new treaty. Articles governing dispute settlement, federal states, reservations, denunciation and other final clauses provide the legal scaffolding regulating application of the Convention.\nSome of the most important provisions include:\n– Article 3 prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, or country of origin. Refugees are to be treated without discrimination.\n– Article 4 guarantees refugees freedom of religious practice, including religious education of children.\n– Article 16 provides refugees free access to courts on the territory of all Contracting States.\n– Articles 17-19 promote economic rights of refugees related to wage-earning employment, self-employment, and professional practice.\n– Articles 20-24 address social welfare rights including rationing, housing, education, public relief, and labor protections.\n– Article 26 upholds the right of refugees to choose their place of residence and move freely within the territory.\n– Article 31 prohibits penalization for illegal entry, recognizing refugees may need to breach immigration rules to seek asylum.\n– Article 33 lays out the principle of non-refoulement or non-return to territories where a refugee’s life or freedom would be threatened. This is considered the cornerstone of refugee protection.\nThe most significant absence in the original Convention was an explicit right to asylum. While host countries are obligated to provide protection consistent with other Convention rights, the treaty does not confer an individual right to be granted asylum. This was a deliberate choice by negotiators who were not prepared to accept an asylum obligation.\nEntry into Force and 1967 Protocol\nThe 1951 Refugee Convention entered into force on April 22, 1954 after being ratified by the required 6 countries. It initially garnered relatively few accessions, with just 17 parties by 1955. However, the number of States grew to 86 by 1965 and 148 by 1990, solidifying the treaty’s status as the foundation of international refugee law. The 1967 Protocol completed the Convention framework. By removing the geographic and time limits in the original version, it expanded protections to refugees worldwide. The Protocol entered into force on October 4, 1967 and by 2012 had 146 States Parties.\nWhile the 1951 Convention was initially confined to European refugees, its drafters gave the document universal aspirations. The Preamble expresses the aim that all States extend refugee protections as widely as possible. This forward-looking language paved the way for the 1967 Protocol’s amendments to broaden scope. The Convention’s universal refugee definition also created a template that enabled expansion once circumstances allowed. When the Protocol eliminated the date and geographic restrictions, the Convention instantly applied to new refugee populations that had previously fallen outside its mandate.\nFundamental Principles\nBeyond enumerating refugee rights, the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol established core principles that underpin modern international refugee protection. These fundamental concepts include:\nNon-Discrimination – A cornerstone of refugee law is the principle that rights be granted without discrimination based on race, religion, nationality, or country of origin. Rooted in Article 3 of the Convention, non-discrimination aims to ensure refugees’ human rights are not subject to prejudicial treatment.\nNon-Penalization – Article 31 prohibits States from imposing penalties on refugees for illegal entry or unlawful presence when they arrive directly from danger and present themselves to authorities. This acknowledges protection seekers may need to breach immigration rules to flee persecution.\nNon-Refoulement – Article 33 contains the critical prohibition on expulsion or return (refoulement) of refugees to territories where their life or freedom would be threatened. Enshrined as a customary norm of international law, non-refoulement is the most widely recognized principle of refugee protection.\nFamily Unity – While not explicitly guaranteed in the Convention, the importance of family unity is emphasized in Recommendation B of the Final Act. Respecting the integrity of the family unit has since been recognized as a fundamental principle.\nCooperation with UNHCR – The Convention tasks UNHCR with overseeing implementation and supporting States in meeting protection obligations. This pioneering role made UNHCR the international guardian of the treaty.\nWhile the Convention outlines minimum standards, States are encouraged to extend additional or more favorable protections where possible. It aims to provide a base of rights refugee law can build upon, not a ceiling. This has enabled the development of regional agreements and national policies conferring extra protections beyond those in the Convention.\nGaps, Limitations and Implementation\nFor its groundbreaking role defining modern refugee law, the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol have some inherent limitations. As a product of post-war political compromises, the treaties contain gaps. The lack of an explicit individual right to asylum has already been mentioned. In addition, developing countries argue the Convention reflects Western humanitarian ideals over practical burdens faced by refugee-hosting States, particularly in the global South.\nCritics also highlight weak enforcement mechanisms. The Convention lacks concrete procedures to monitor and ensure governmental compliance. Implementation depends largely on the cooperation and oversight role of UNHCR. There are no penalties for States violating obligations. While refugees can lodge individual complaints against violations, outcomes are not legally enforceable. The absence of strong monitoring tools has been an obstacle to consistent compliance.\nFederal clause provisions allow federal States to avoid applying Convention rights that fall under constituent state/provincial jurisdiction. Reservations enable States to opt out of some obligations, except for non-derogable articles. Temporal applicability limitations mean the Convention does not cover internally displaced persons who have not crossed borders. These legal gaps leave some refugees outside the scope of protection.\nThere are also debates regarding how to apply the refugee definition. It leaves room for interpretation for terms like “well-founded fear” and “membership in a particular social group.” Definitional scope issues are compounded by practical challenges with refugee status determination, especially in the Global South. Despite best efforts, UNHCR often lacks capacity to ensure fair, consistent decision-making.\nImplementation is further complicated by the political sensitivities surrounding asylum. Rising xenophobia and policies deterring refugee arrivals have led some States to circumvent Convention principles. Controversial practices include offshore processing, pushbacks at borders, and designating countries as “safe” to justify accelerated returns. While likely violating core prohibitions like non-refoulement, deterrence policies exploit flexibility in the Convention framework.\nIn Summary\n– Adopted in 1951, the Convention is the foundation of international refugee law, consolidating previous agreements and introducing a universal refugee definition.\n– The 1967 Protocol expanded scope beyond Europe and removed date restrictions in the 1951 Convention.\n– Together, the treaties define who is a refugee, enumerate refugee rights, and outline State obligations for protection.\n– Key provisions include non-discrimination, non-penalization for illegal entry, non-refoulement, rights to work, education, identity documents, and cooperation with UNHCR.\n– Core principles established include non-discrimination, non-penalization, non-refoulement, family unity, and UNHCR supervision.\n– Gaps include lack of an individual right to asylum, weak enforcement mechanisms, reservations, and federal state clauses allowing non-application of some provisions.\n– The Convention provides baseline standards, with room for more favorable treatment, regional agreements, and evolving interpretation.\n– Imperfections exist, but the treaties remain the centerpiece of the international refugee regime.\n– Over 140 States have acceded to the treaties, which have provided legal status and rights to millions of refugees.\nConclusion\nFor over fifty years, the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol have served as the basis of the international refugee protection regime, providing legal status and rights to millions. While imperfect, the treaties represent a groundbreaking, widely embraced effort by the international community to establish common standards for the treatment of forcibly displaced people. The Convention’s definition, fundamental principles and catalog of rights represent a bold endeavor to confer dignity, agency and human rights on a vulnerable population often deprived of national protection.\nNo international mechanism is beyond criticism, but many gaps in the Convention framework have been filled through evolving political commitments, jurisprudence, and guidance from UNHCR exercising its supervisory responsibility. Regional and national laws have also reinforced protections. There is room to further strengthen the international refugee system, but it rests on a robust foundation laid down in the pivotal 1951 and 1967 instruments. For over half a century, the Convention and Protocol have adapted to changing circumstances while retaining relevance as the cornerstone of refugee law.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_tories-must-reclaim-their-identity-amidst-leadership-turmoil/content_1280.html": "Tories Must Reclaim Their Identity Amidst Leadership Turmoil\nIn the wake of the most catastrophic electoral defeat in Conservative Party history, the Tories find themselves not only in search of a new leader but also grappling with a profound identity crisis. The party, fractured by internal divisions and ideological disputes, now faces the daunting task of charting a new course for its future.\nThe abysmal performance at the polls has left the Conservatives reeling, forcing them to confront existential questions about their direction and purpose. As they embark on the process of selecting a successor to Rishi Sunak, the party must simultaneously wrestle with fundamental issues that will shape its trajectory for years to come.\nA Crossroads for Conservative Values\nThe Tories now stand at a critical juncture, compelled to make crucial decisions about their ideological stance and electoral strategy. Two divergent paths lie before them: should they veer rightwards in an attempt to neutralise the growing threat posed by Reform UK? Or should they heed the conventional wisdom that suggests elections can only be won from the centre ground?\nThis ideological quandary is inextricably linked to the leadership contest that will unfold in the coming weeks and months. The candidate who ultimately emerges victorious will not only inherit the mantle of party leadership but will also be tasked with defining the Conservative vision for the future.\nLeadership Contenders: A Depleted Field\nThe electoral bloodbath has dramatically altered the landscape of potential leadership candidates. Several prominent figures who were once considered frontrunners have been unceremoniously ejected from Parliament, narrowing the field of contenders.\nPenny Mordaunt, widely regarded as a favourite to succeed Sunak, has lost her seat and is no longer eligible to contest the leadership. Similarly, Steve Baker, the ardent Brexiteer who had publicly expressed his intention to throw his hat into the ring, finds himself out of the running. Grant Shapps, the former defence secretary, has also been relegated to the political wilderness.\nAmong the survivors of the electoral carnage, two names have emerged as the most talked-about candidates, representing opposite ends of the ideological spectrum within the party. Kemi Badenoch, the outgoing business secretary, is seen as the standard-bearer for the right wing of the party. In contrast, Tom Tugendhat, the outgoing security minister, is viewed as the torchbearer for the centrist, One Nation faction of the Conservatives.\nA Crowded Field of Aspirants\nDespite the loss of several high-profile figures, the list of potential leadership candidates remains extensive. Three former home secretaries are said to be considering a bid: James Cleverly, Dame Priti Patel, and Suella Braverman. Robert Jenrick, who recently resigned as immigration minister, and Victoria Atkins, the outgoing health secretary, are also names being floated in Conservative circles.\nIn an intriguing twist, rumours have begun to circulate that Jeremy Hunt, the outgoing chancellor, might contemplate a third attempt at securing the party leadership. Hunt, who narrowly retained his seat in the newly-created constituency of Godalming and Ash, has previously contested the leadership in 2019 and 2022.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, there is even speculation about the potential return of Boris Johnson. Some within the party are suggesting that the former prime minister could make a dramatic comeback by contesting a future by-election and reassuming the leadership before the next general election.\nBehind-the-Scenes Machinations\nWhile the public face of the Conservative Party attempts to maintain a semblance of unity in the aftermath of the electoral debacle, behind the scenes, the jockeying for position has been underway for months. Ambitious MPs and their supporters have been quietly laying the groundwork for leadership bids, cultivating alliances, and refining their pitches to party members.\nThe leadership arguments and recriminations are no longer confined to private conversations and closed-door meetings. In the immediate aftermath of the election, several prominent Conservatives have already begun to stake out their positions and critique their colleagues publicly.\nJames Cleverly, in his acceptance speech after retaining his seat, issued a stark warning against embracing “simplistic” solutions. In a thinly-veiled criticism of those advocating a shift towards Reform UK’s populist agenda, he declared that there was “nothing honourable” in pursuing populist remedies to complex problems.\nCleverly, considered a moderate within the party, demurred when asked about his own leadership ambitions, stating that such discussions were “not for tonight”. However, his refusal to categorically rule out a leadership bid has been interpreted by many as a sign of his interest in the top job.\nA Party Divided: The Ideological Battleground\nThe Conservative Party’s internal divisions have been laid bare in the wake of the election, with various factions engaging in open warfare over the direction of the party.\nSir Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary who lost his seat in Swindon South, launched a blistering attack on colleagues such as Suella Braverman. He accused them of “competing for attention” and criticised the practice of writing articles conceding defeat before votes had even been cast.\nBuckland reserved particular ire for those advocating a rightward shift in the party’s positioning. He warned that such a move “would be a disastrous mistake and it would send us into the abyss, and gift Labour government for many years”.\nThis sentiment was echoed by Tobias Ellwood, the former defence minister who lost his Bournemouth East seat. Ellwood not only criticised Braverman but went so far as to suggest that the Conservative Party membership should be stripped of their right to participate in leadership elections.\nEllwood argued that the current system, which allows party members to select the leader from a shortlist of two candidates chosen by MPs, was perpetuating internal discord. He contended that aspiring leaders like Braverman were more concerned with appealing to the party base than demonstrating loyalty to their parliamentary colleagues.\nThe outspoken former minister went on to assert that any serious attempt to regroup or improve the party’s electoral prospects would be futile unless fundamental changes were made to the leadership selection process. He warned that failure to address this issue would condemn the Conservatives to a prolonged period in opposition.\nEllwood’s comments highlight a growing schism within the party between those who believe the Conservatives should remain a broad church, appealing to the middle ground, and those who advocate for a more ideologically pure, right-wing approach.\nThe Challenge of Unity\nThe task facing the next Conservative leader is monumental. Not only must they attempt to rebuild the party’s shattered credibility with the electorate, but they must also find a way to unite a deeply divided parliamentary party.\nThe factional nature of the modern Conservative Party presents a significant obstacle to any would-be leader. If a centrist candidate from the One Nation wing of the party, such as Tom Tugendhat, were to emerge victorious, there is a real risk that right-wing MPs might defect to Reform UK. Conversely, if a candidate from the right of the party were to win, moderate Conservatives could potentially jump ship to the Liberal Democrats.\nChris Heaton-Harris, the former Northern Ireland secretary who chose not to stand for re-election, summed up the party’s predicament succinctly: “For the last 24 months, it’s been disunited and you will never win a general election with a disunited political backdrop.”\nThe Road Ahead\nAs the Conservative Party embarks on its journey to select a new leader and redefine its identity, it faces a series of existential questions. Can the various factions within the party be reconciled? Is it possible to craft a coherent vision that appeals both to the party’s traditional base and to the broader electorate?\nThe answers to these questions will not only determine the immediate future of the Conservative Party but will also shape the landscape of British politics for years to come. As the Tories grapple with these weighty issues, the eyes of the nation – and indeed the world – will be watching closely to see if this venerable political institution can rise from the ashes of electoral defeat and once again present itself as a credible force in British politics.\nThe coming weeks and months promise to be a period of intense soul-searching, heated debate, and potentially seismic change within the Conservative Party. Whether this process will result in a reinvigorated and united party ready to challenge for power once again, or whether it will lead to further fragmentation and decline, remains to be seen. One thing, however, is certain: the decisions made in the aftermath of this historic defeat will reverberate through British politics for generations to come.",

The current political climate, under the leadership of Keir Starmer, appears to be taking a worrying turn, marked by an unprecedented level of control over public discourse and personal opinion. Starmer, in his perceived wisdom, has cast a wide net, labelling anyone who disagrees with his narrative as “far-right.” This broad-brush approach not only stifles genuine debate but also criminalises the expression of opinions via electronic means.\nIt’s not merely a matter of someone casually stating their opinion online anymore. Under new measures, even something as innocuous as commenting on a ginger cat could land you in legal trouble if it’s perceived to convey a certain message or viewpoint. The laws governing the transmission of information by electronic means are being weaponised to clamp down on free speech, effectively placing a gagging order on the entire nation.\nThis shift towards authoritarianism has been swift. Within just a month of Starmer assuming office, we’ve witnessed what could be one of the most significant false flag operations in recent British history. This event was followed by a shocking display of arrogance, with individuals like Nick Lowles from Hope Not Hate seemingly boasting about the operation’s success. The timing of this so-called false flag coincided with a violent criminal turning 18, raising suspicions that it might have been orchestrated as a distraction. Yet, due to the current oppressive environment, where expressing scepticism can be perilous, many are hesitant to voice their doubts.\nThe erosion of free speech is tragic. Honest debate and the exchange of differing opinions have always been one of life’s great pleasures, a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Now, many of us find ourselves self-censoring, wary of the potential repercussions of speaking our minds. The very fabric of our society is being torn apart as people are silenced, targeted by the mainstream media, and branded with labels that are repeated until they stick.\nOne might wonder whether these individuals, who are subjected to such intense scrutiny, have actually done anything to incite violence. The response often given is that their opinions are “divisive.” Yet, there exists a different segment of society whose opinions are far more divisive, and whose actions and statements are overtly harmful. These individuals, however, seem to be overlooked by the same authorities who are quick to clamp down on others.\nThe events of the past few weeks have pushed people to their limits. The country is struggling to cope with the sheer numbers of people entering, a strain that is felt by all, irrespective of their background. The violent attack in Southport and the disturbing incident involving youths attacking a policewoman at Manchester Airport have further exacerbated tensions. Yet, while people expressing their frustration online are being arrested, those who committed these violent acts are out on bail, giving interviews, and portraying themselves as victims. The irony is not lost on the public.\nWhat is clear is that the current trajectory is unsustainable. The government’s approach to dealing with dissent, akin to erecting a Berlin Wall of censorship and control, will only lead to further unrest. If this metaphorical wall is allowed to stand and be reinforced, anyone attempting to challenge it will face severe consequences. This raises a critical question: Is this the future we want for our country?\nThe answer should be a resounding no. History has shown that you cannot bully, threaten, or intimidate people into compliance. Even Aldous Huxley, a keen observer of totalitarian regimes, noted that such a state requires at least some degree of public consent to function. Without it, the system inevitably collapses. His words have never been more relevant than they are today.\nAs we stand at this crossroads, it is imperative that we resist these authoritarian measures. The UK has a proud history of democracy, debate, and free speech. To preserve these values, we must speak out against any attempts to silence us, no matter how formidable the opposition may seem. The future of our nation depends on it",

Examining the History and Law\nThe status of the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria, is one of the most contentious issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In debates on this topic, it is often claimed that Israel “occupies” this territory. But what does this actually mean from a legal and historical perspective? Let’s examine the facts.\nHistorical Background\nUp until the early 20th century, the area comprising modern-day Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and surrounding countries was part of the Ottoman Empire. Following the empire’s defeat in World War I, its lands were divided up under the 1920 San Remo Resolution which established the ‘Mandate System’ under the supervision of the League of Nations.\nThe key outcome was that one mandate was created for ‘Palestine’ with the explicit purpose of establishing a Jewish national home in the region. The borders of this mandate, which was ratified by the League of Nations in 1922, encompassed all of what is today Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and Jordan. The name ‘Palestine’ was simply a label used by the Romans after their conquest of ancient Judea.\nThe Creation of Israel and Arab-Israeli War\nIn 1947, the United Nations approved a partition plan to divide the Palestine Mandate into separate Jewish and Arab states. This was a non-binding proposal, but nonetheless in 1948 Israel declared independence within the borders of the mandate per international law. Upon Israel’s founding it was invaded by five Arab armies aiming to destroy the new state. By 1949 armistice agreements had been signed, but Jordan had militarily occupied east Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, expelling all Jewish residents.\nUnder international law, borders cannot be altered through military conquest. Yet the 1949 armistice lines departed from the borders of the mandate, with Jordan seizing the West Bank and east Jerusalem. When Israel captured these territories in the 1967 Six Day War, it was retaking areas recognised under international law as belonging to Israel, not unlawfully occupying foreign lands.\nThe Legal Status of the West Bank\nSeveral key principles determine borders under international law. The uti possidetis juris principle holds that new states inherit the borders of the preceding administrative unit. Therefore Israel’s borders upon independence were those of the Palestine Mandate. Furthermore, defensive wars do not alter borders. So when Israel recaptured the West Bank in 1967, it was retaking its own territory according to the borders affirmed in 1920-22, not acquiring somebody else’s land.\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 242 passed after the Six Day War required Israel to withdraw from territories captured, but not all territories, while recognising Israel’s right to secure borders. Judea and Samaria formed part of the Jewish homeland under the League of Nations mandates. Israel has strong historical and legal claims to this area.\nDoes Israel “Occupy” the West Bank?\nIn legal terms, ‘occupation’ refers to a temporary foreign military control of territory belonging to another country. Yet the West Bank was part of the Palestine Mandate intended for Jewish settlement, and Israel only gained control after defensive wars. Israel has also relinquished occupied land before, such as Sinai after the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty.\nWhile complex issues remain regarding governance and nationality, under international law Israel does not “occupy” the West Bank. The land was part of the borders designated for a Jewish state in 1922. Jordan’s subsequent invasion and annexation did not nullify this recognition. Israel gained control through acts of self-defence, not aggression. The legal history shows Israel has credible claims to the territory. The situation is disputed, but the “occupation” label does not accurately reflect the history or law.\nThe Path Forwards\nIn the 1990s the Oslo Accords established Palestinian Authority rule in parts of the West Bank, but negotiations since then have failed to produce a final settlement. With the Palestinians rejecting successive offers of statehood, it is unclear whether a comprehensive deal is currently feasible.\nNonetheless, the complexities warrant a careful approach. Unilateral actions could undermine the possibilities for peace. While Israel has valid historical and legal claims in the West Bank, it also has sometimes acted questionably in building settlements. There are persuasive arguments the most constructive path forward is through open dialogue, compromise and mutual understanding – not reactionary rhetoric, absolutism or exaggerations.\nExamining this issue in light of the history and law reveals ambiguities on both sides. The situation remains unresolved. There are reasoned cases in support of differing views. As we consider this polarising topic, greater nuance and recognition of competing perspectives are surely needed. But the oft-repeated claim that Israel “occupies” the West Bank overlooks the substance of this long-running dispute. Reality is not so clear cut.\nEditorial Comment:\nIsrael was founded according to international law, there was never an independent state of Palestine in the area and the name itself dates back to an ancient Greek term, from the 5th century BC, this was a term used in reference to a region, not a people, at that time, the Arabs were know as the Philistines.\nThe legal borders of Israel, according to international law include what is now Gaza and the West Bank, which was an area invaded by Jordon after israel was founded and as we know from the principles of uti possidetis juris, land which is ‘A war of aggression, cannot be used to change another country’s borders’ and that translates in to the West Bank, still being a legal part of Israel, along with Gaza.\nAs I have previously said, the hate for Jews pre-dates the formation of Israel, and despite the fact that the Israelis where willing to live in peace with their neighbours, the feeling was, is and never will be mutual.\nOther Arab nations have began to move on, with the Gulf states becoming increasingly aware that they need to plan for post-oil economies, moving to tourism and investment in property, which would be hindered by ongoing hostility with Israel, however Hamas and its supporters continue to spread hate and misinformation, relying on the blind support from muslims around the world.\nIsrael has a legal and moral obligation to defend itself to best of its ability, for the alternative would be to capitulate to terrorism and if there is one thing that history has taught us it is, that ‘you cannot reason with a Tiger, when your head is in its mouth!’\nThis is the first time that I have read a fair and accurate account of the situation in Israel, I wasn’t aware that the West Bank was actually a legal part of Israel, I have just checked and you are right. The fact that mainstream media do not tell us this, indicates that they have been misleading us for decades! Keep it up please.\nThis is the first time that I have read a fair and accurate account of the situation in Israel, I wasn’t aware that the West Bank was actually a legal part of Israel, I have just checked and you are right.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_what-you-need-to-know-about-labours-proposed-vat-on-private-school-fees/content_855.html": "What You Need to Know about Labour’s Proposed VAT on Private School Fees\nIntroduction\nWhat is Labour’s policy on placing VAT on private school fees? This question has been the subject of much speculation, with over three million search results on the internet for the phrase “Labour Party VAT school fees.” This article aims to provide clarity on the potential change in the VAT liability of school fees under a Labour administration, avoiding unnecessary speculation.\nExisting VAT Exemption for Private Education\nA Long-standing Exemption\nExemption from VAT for primary and secondary education was introduced in the Finance Act 1972, when VAT relief was first granted for education “provided by a school,” together with “any goods or services incidental to the provision of education,” and the “provision of any instruction supplemental to the provision of any education.” These core concepts have survived successive Finance Acts and court decisions and are now enshrined in the VAT Act 1994. Although the wording may have changed over time, the VAT exemption for private education has remained remarkably consistent in its application for over 50 years since the inception of VAT on 1 April 1973.\nLabour’s Proposed Changes\nThe £1.6bn Target\nThe Labour Party has announced its intention to introduce VAT on private school fees, with a figure of £1.6bn per year routinely cited by both the Labour Party and most media reporting. This figure is supported by a report published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies (“IFS”) in July 2023, entitled “Tax, private school fees and state school spending.” The IFS made several assumptions in support of its calculations, including:\n– VAT will be imposed on both day fees and boarding fees.\n– Nursery fees are excluded, assuming they are covered by the free entitlement to early education and childcare.\n– Fees paid by foreign pupils should be included, as the service is consumed within the UK.\n– 20% of private school costs are subject to VAT at 20%, with about £340 million deducted for VAT paid across the sector, as the sector would be entitled to fully offset VAT on its costs against the VAT paid to HMRC.\n– Specialist provision would remain exempt from VAT, particularly fees for pupils with education, health, and care plans.\nUnpicking the Current VAT Exemption\nAny changes must unpick the current VAT exemption. Private schools secure exemption for education and the provision of related goods and services because they are “eligible bodies,” as defined by the VAT Act. A private school may be an eligible body for either or both of the following reasons:\n1. It is a school, as defined by various Education Acts.\n2. Its constitution prevents the distribution of any profits on its educational activities, which is most likely the case if it is a charity.\nTo achieve the £1.6bn target, VAT law will need to:\n– Remove independent schools from the list of eligible bodies without also removing specialist providers of education, such as for pupils with education, health, and care plans.\n– Remove the VAT exemption from a defined cohort of independent schools restricted from distributing their profits, without the unintended consequence of the loss of VAT exemption for other charitable and third sector organisations.\nOnce these changes are made, private schools can no longer rely on the VAT exemption for the fees charged for the provision of education.\nClosely Related Goods and Services\nThe VAT exemption additionally provides relief from VAT for “closely related” goods and services provided by eligible bodies. HMRC accepts that the following qualify as closely related:\n– Accommodation\n– Catering\n– Transport\n– School trips\n– Field trips\nTo achieve the intended £1.6bn outcome, and remembering that the IFS included boarding fees in its calculations, HM Treasury solicitors should specify that closely related goods and services are included in any legislation as specifically liable to 20% VAT.\nThere is precedent for including supplies within the VAT net that may otherwise be zero-rated or exempt from VAT, such as publications provided as a linked supply with the provision of education.\nAnti-forestalling Provisions\nThe Labour Party has stated it will backdate the introduction of these measures to frustrate prepayment of school fees for future years and ensure it meets its targets for additional VAT receipts. It cites steps taken in 2011 by the coalition government when the rate of VAT increased to 20%. These are known as “anti-forestalling” provisions.\nWhile there is precedent for the introduction of anti-forestalling measures, it is typically not backdated earlier than an announcement in a Budget introducing the change.\nPlanning for the Future\nSøren Kierkegaard’s Wisdom\n“Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” This quote from Søren Kierkegaard is a good starting point for planning for the potential changes in VAT liability for private school fees.\nImmediate Actions\nIn terms of planning, you can take the following immediate actions:\n– Change your accounting software to separately record VAT on your costs. This will make it easier to secure full VAT recovery in the future.\n– Record all building and renovation work in the last ten years with total spend above £250,000. You can secure partial recovery of VAT on these costs following the imposition of VAT.\n– Assess whether 20% of your school’s costs are liable to VAT at 20%. Any recovery of VAT mitigates the impact of VAT payable on school fees.\nAdditional Considerations\n– Offering parents the opportunity to prepay fees now for the next academic year. It is hard to see any legislation being backdated beyond the general election, but not impossible to see legislation barring prepayment further than the academic year in which it is introduced.\n– Do not make changes that are not cost-free, such as the establishment of separate trading entities. Until we know the form of any changes to VAT law, any changes that seek to ringfence certain business income are inherently risky.\n– Avoid using ideas without a thorough understanding of the basis in VAT law, and the potential downside risks to the school in terms of penalties and interest if the idea does not withstand challenge from HMRC.\nHow much will this cost parents?\nThe average school fees in the UK are believed to be approximately £16,500 per year, therefore adding VAT on top will take the total payable to around £20,000, per child, per year!\nDespite the narrative, the vast majority of children in Independent schools are not from wealthy families, that is actually a small percentage, the vast majority are from hard working families who make sacrifices in order to be able to pay the fees, to give their children a better start in life. These are the very people who Labour are intending to target. It would be wrong to even refer to many of these people as ‘middle class’ as many are people who work everyday jobs, pay mortgages or even rent and all they want is a better future for their children and Keir Starmer has no problem punishing them.\nWhat do Reform UK offer as an alternative?\nReform UK are not only pledging to never add VAT to school fees, but in addition to this, we are also proposing that parents who make the sacrifice to pay school fees, to send their children to independent schools should be supported, because every child that is educated independently, results in one less child being educated by the state.\nTherefore, we will offer parents 20% tax relief on school fees, which when compared to Labour’s education tax grab, results in a huge saving for parents.\nIn fact, when taking the average school fees of £16,500 per year, the saving for parents with Reform UK is around £6,000 per year, when compared to the cost under Labour!\nConclusion\n– Labour has announced plans to introduce VAT on private school fees, targeting £1.6 billion in additional revenue per year based on estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n– To achieve this, VAT law would need to be changed to:\n– Remove independent schools from the list of VAT exempt “eligible bodies”\n– Remove the VAT exemption specifically for private schools restricted from distributing profits\n– Specify that closely related goods/services like accommodation and school trips are subject to 20% VAT\n– Labour intends to use “anti-forestalling” provisions to backdate the changes and prevent prepayment of fees before implementation.\n– Private schools should take steps now to prepare, including:\n– Updating accounting to separately track VATed costs\n– Documenting recent construction projects over £250,000 for partial VAT recovery\n– Considering timing of prepaid fees and capital projects around the changes\n– Caution is advised against major restructuring or using untested VAT planning ideas that could face HMRC challenges.\n– Professional guidance is recommended to understand the full impact and properly plan for maintaining profitability under Labour’s proposed VAT policies.\nThere is an inherently uncertain future regarding Labour’s proposed VAT on private school fees. As always, professional guidance is available to help you understand the tax effect on your organisation and preserve its future profitability and viability.\nUltimately, this is clear evidence that the Labour party is not a party that wishes to encourage success amongst everyday people unless it is those who are within the ‘Labour Party Fold’ and just the mere assumption that they will be in power soon, has seen them rubbing their hands together as they plot to rob Peter to pay Paul, then they will subsequently rob Paul to pay their friends.\nThere is no doubt that a Labour administration will be truly catastrophic for the UK.",

Should the nation have been locked-down in the first place?\nDifficult questions and hindsight is a wonderful thing, but what we do know is, that the government scientific advisers were wrong, not just once, not twice, but consistently. Boris did not want to lock the nation down, but the advisers managed to successfully terrify an entire nation, leaving him no other choice. The consequences are yet to filter through in their entirety, our nation is basically broke. A decade of austerity down the drain.\nEnter the leadership challenge, weeks of embarrassing American style hustings, with candidates not only discrediting each other, but simultaneously discrediting the government, turning the position in to a live grenade, that would invariably have blown up in the face of whoever was unfortunate enough to win the prize position of Prime Minister.\nEnter the Witch-Hunt against Boris Johnson. We are all familiar with the course of events, but without defending him, just covering the facts, despite the media agenda to oust him, Boris was not partying while everyone was in lockdown, the actual course of events on the day in question were:\nIt was his birthday\nHe and all the staff had every reason to be at work and take lunch in the garden of Number 10\nThey had every right to eat a slice of cake and even have a glass of Champagne, as it was not prohibited\nThe offence was actually committed by Carrie, who invited a friend of hers, who had no right to be there.\nWhat should Boris have done? Perhaps his statement to parliament should have been something like this:\n“I accept that the law was broken on that day, unbeknown to me, my wife Carrie had ordered a cake and invited a friend of hers, who should not have attended, I have reported her to the police, who will be visiting later to issue a fixed penalty, before she packs her bags and leaves me!”\nWho would not have done that?\nSecondly, he did not allow an allegation to prevent an MP from resigning, which later turned out that he had committed another offence, for which Boris took the blame, but what would have been the situation if that person were a minority of some sort and Boris had allowed an allegation to become an obstacle to their career?\nInstead, the traitors lead by Rishi Sunak began to resign and the rest is history.\nIt was immediately obvious that most Conservative voters were not happy about the party removing the leader who they had elected and attempting to replace him with Rishi the snake. In the end Lizz Truss was elected by the party, but despite her good intentions, she was, to say the least, an amateur.\nIn her haste to prove herself, she railroaded Kawas Kwertang to make sweeping changes to taxes which may well have helped the economy to grow, but in the end, it was gambling with the economy and that is not the way that things should be done.\nAs the markets went in to meltdown, something had to be done, so Kwasi was forced to take the fall, while Liz kept quiet. She then place Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor, another traitor, Europhile, Brexit sabotager, advocate of more lockdowns and candidate for the position of PM, which he proposed lowering corporation tax to 15%\nIn one clean sweep, he reversed just about every single policy that Liz Truss was elected for, leaving us with a ‘lame Duck’ PM and even more uncertainty. The markets may have been appeased for now, but this is not the end of the crisis, not by a long shot!",

While protests are a legitimate form of free speech, this event risks inflaming tensions. All sides should reflect carefully on how to express their views without violence.\nThe Right to Protest\nFree speech is a cornerstone of democracy. Non-violent protest allows diverse voices to be heard. However, with rights come responsibilities. Thoughtless words can wound communities and incite hatred.\nProtesters must recognise the pain their actions may cause. November 11th commemorates those who sacrificed their lives in war. Many see poppies and wreaths as symbols of that sacrifice. Defiling them offends mourners, including veterans, families of the fallen and their communities. A protest perceived as anti-British would disturb them on a solemn day of reflection.\nDangers of Public Disorder\nThe narrator warns the protest could provoke “an equal reaction” from some members of the public. Angry confrontations between opposing groups must be avoided. Public disorder endangers protesters, bystanders and police officers trying to keep the peace.\nWhile the authorities have a duty to allow peaceful protest, public safety is paramount. If a planned event seems likely to provoke violence, restrictions may be imposed to prevent a breach of the peace. However, excessive limits on protest risk heavy-handedness. The situation calls for nuanced judgements.\nBridging Divides\nBehind this controversy lies a complex history of Ireland and the UK. Old wounds run deep. To overcome mutual distrust, both sides must listen to the other’s narrative. Though painful, reflecting on the full legacy of the past is the only way to reconcile.\nMost people agree terrorist violence is unjustified. But labelling all Republicans as supporters of terrorism is counter-productive. Dialogue with moderate, democratic Irish nationalists can build common ground. Stereotyping and demonising the other side leads nowhere.\nThe Need for Inclusive Patriotism\nFor many British people, Remembrance Day evokes pride in generations who served this country. But patriotism should also encompass those we have disagreed with. Our shared history with Ireland includes moments of unity as well as conflict.\nThe UK’s diversity is a strength, allowing different identities to coexist. An inclusive patriotism celebrates this, while seeking to right past wrongs. We can honour the fallen, but also acknowledge mistakes made. This nuanced patriotism builds social cohesion.\nConclusion\nThis protest has prompted strong feelings, but they must be expressed constructively. Though free speech permits protests, the event organisers should reflect on their responsibilities. Restraint and mutual understanding are vital to avoid inflaming tensions. We must find common ground, recognising no community has a monopoly on virtue or victimhood. With care and wisdom, we can nurture the bonds of civility that unite our society.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-trump-return-is-a-catastrophe-for-germany/content_772.html": "The Trump Return is a Catastrophe for Germany\nTariffs and Ukraine’s Capitulation Would Devastate Europe’s Former Economic Engine\nThe venerable German newspaper Die Zeit captured the moment with a single English word splashed across its front page, summarising the implications for Europe, NATO, the world trading system, and particularly Germany: “F–k”.\n“Neither looking away nor fear helps, and ultimately we’re left with feeble self-consolation,” the paper noted, referencing Heinz Kohut’s Self Psychology for a Fractured World.\nA Trump return poses challenges for Labour-led Britain too: the Trump inflation trade has driven 10-year gilt yields to nearly 4.6pc, consuming Rachel Reeves’s “headroom” before she begins. Yet Trump may overlook our Foreign Secretary’s previous description of him as a “woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”.\nDavid Lammy’s foresight in cultivating Trump’s advisers aligns with his ‘progressive realism’ approach. He’s engaged positively with Project 2025’s architects, whose blueprint for Trump’s second presidency emphasises “urgent development of post-Brexit UK trade before London gravitates back to the EU”.\nWhilst the special relationship may face awkward moments, Labour and MAGA might find unexpected common ground.\nFor Germany, however, Trump’s triumph spells unmitigated disaster, coinciding with the uncharacteristically discordant collapse of Scholz’s coalition.\n“Trump’s victory marks the Federal Republic’s most challenging economic period,” warns Moritz Schularick, who leads the Kiel Institute. “Our domestic structural crisis now compounds severe foreign trade and security challenges we’re ill-equipped to handle.”\nRecent industrial figures reinforce this pessimism, showing a further 2.5pc September decline, including a 7.8pc drop in automotive production. Industrial output has retreated to levels last seen 18 years ago, whilst the German economy has stagnated since 2018.\nTrump’s peculiar animosity towards Germany—despite his grandfather Friedrich Trump’s Rhineland roots—stems from his perception of German opportunism. He accuses the nation of exploiting both American consumers and military protection whilst enjoying preferential Russian energy arrangements.\n“My first move was terminating Nord Stream 2,” he recently told Chicago’s Economic Club. “Consider this: Putin constructs the world’s largest pipeline to Germany, receiving billions monthly, yet we’re expected to defend you against your primary energy supplier?”\nHis aversion to German vehicles (though he owns several) originated from Trump Tower views of Mercedes and BMWs dominating Fifth Avenue.\nWhilst his focus on automobile sales may seem outdated—AI firm Nvidia’s £3.6 trillion valuation dwarfs Volkswagen’s modest £4 billion—Trump correctly identifies Germany’s export-driven model as a significant market distortion.\nGermany’s current predicament is well-documented. Every strategic gambit has backfired. The Nord Stream pipelines lie damaged beneath the Baltic, whilst Germany’s dangerous bargain with Xi Jinping’s China has backfired as Chinese firms master—or appropriate—German expertise, outperforming the export champion domestically and across Europe.\nSix years ago, a prescient Volkswagen executive warned staff that “perpetual success isn’t guaranteed” and that Germany’s automotive sector risked following Coventry’s fate if it remained wedded to combustion engines whilst underestimating electric vehicles. His reform attempts led to his dismissal.\nVW now faces three German factory closures. National car production has plummeted from 6m units in 2014 to 4.2m last year. The EU’s Draghi report acknowledges Chinese EV supremacy “across virtually all metrics”, from range to charging speed and software.\nThis week marked the collapse of Germany’s final wager. The nation confronts twin threats: a Trump presidency potentially enabling Putin’s Ukrainian victory—with profound EU implications—and sweeping tariffs of 10pc to 20pc on European exports, possibly higher for automobiles.\nTrump’s Chicago remarks revealed his perspective: “The European Union—such a lovely concept, these charming European nations united. Yet they reject our cars, our agricultural products—everything. You face a £312bn EU deficit. They’re essentially a smaller-scale China.”\nThough last year’s actual deficit was £170bn, his argument resonates. Germany generated half this imbalance, highlighting deeper issues. The country has maintained a 6pc to 8pc GDP current account surplus for nearly twenty years (matching Sweden and Holland).\nThis reflects deliberate policy choices: tax and regulatory frameworks, coupled with fiscal orthodoxy, that suppress domestic consumption and wages to benefit export industries.\nTypically, substantial surpluses self-correct through currency adjustments. Germany circumvented this through the euro’s creation. Trump’s advisers long accused Berlin of manipulating monetary union for competitive advantage.\nThis contains elements of truth, despite lacking intentionality. German cultural attitudes equate thrift with virtue—perhaps attributable to Luther or the German word for debt, “Schuld” (guilt). Nevertheless, this surplus fuelled intra-EMU imbalances triggering the eurozone crisis.\nGerman research institutes now scramble to assess Trump’s tariff impact. One projects £150bn losses over four years—devastating for an already stagnant economy.\nThe Kiel Institute warns of potentially existential consequences if tariff disputes trigger global trading system collapse and geopolitical fragmentation—particularly threatening for an economy where trade approaches 100pc of GDP.\nTrump’s ultimate tariff objectives remain unclear—whether revenue generation and protectionism, or leveraging reciprocal market access: “They tax us, we tax them”. His position often varies mid-statement.\nEither outcome requires Germany to abandon its post-war economic model. Without constitutional debt brake reform and domestic demand stimulation, Germany risks economic depression and decline. The final consequences of past choices now loom.",

Cyprus had officially gained its independence from the British rule on August 16, 1960, when the agreements for the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus were signed.\nHowever, Independence Day was moved to October 1 after the cabinet of ministers in 1963, then made up of seven Greek Cypriots and three Turkish Cypriots, voted to move the date, so as to celebrate appropriately, with honour and the presence of an international diplomatic corps.\nPeace, however, did not last as long as was hoped after the island was given its freedom, as in 1960, Cyprus signed the London-Zurich agreements, which allowed the UK, Greece, and Turkey to retain guarantor power status over the island.\nThe agreement was incorporated into the constitution of the island, which essentially allowed any of the three countries to intervene militarily if violence erupted between the two communities.\nThis led to the intercommunal violence of 1963, which was brought when President Archbishop Makarios III proposed constitutional changes, abrogating powers.\nEnclaves were formed by the Turkish Cypriot community following the violence, prompting the UN to bring its peace keeping forces to the island. 1974 saw a series of events that led to the dark summer, which has left what President Anastasiades has called the ‘unacceptable status quo’.\nAs a military junta in Greece had taken control of Athens, a military coup was plotted against Makarios. On July 15, the coup took place, causing Makarios to flee the Presidential palace.\nJuly 20, however, saw the first phase of the invasion, that left thousands displaced, many missing, and a wound across the island, that leaders of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have since been trying to heal.\nTurkey launched operation Attila on July 20, entering the island from Kyrenia, and seizing control of the area. On August 14, a second wave of attacks followed, this time from Famagusta, which ended in approximately 37 per cent of the island left under Turkish occupation.\nNegotiations restarted in May 2015, when Mustafa Akinci was selected as Turkish Cypriot leader. President Anastasiades and Mr Akinci have been working since then to achieve convergences and bridge gaps, to bring an agreement that the people of Cyprus will accept.\nA new round of intensified talks is set to start next week, as the two leaders seek to close, what the President has called the ‘open wound’.\nThis was the last flag of Cyprus under Colonial rule 1914 – 1960\nThe winning design was based on a proposal by İsmet Güney, a Turkish Cypriot art teacher. The design was chosen by Makarios III, the first President of the Republic, with the consent of Fazil Küçük, the first Vice-President.\nUnder the constitution of Cyprus, the flag of Cyprus may be flown by state institutions, public corporations, and citizens of the country. State institutions, public bodies and corporations may fly the flag of Cyprus along with both the flag of Greece and the flag of Turkey. Private citizens may fly the flag of Cyprus alongside either the Greek flag, the Turkish flag, or both.\nThe Flag of Cyprus from 1960, deliberately EXCLUDING Red & Blue which represented the two communities.\nThe proposed flag under the ‘Annan Plan’ which purposely INCLUDES the Red & Blue of both communities.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-end-of-the-gold-standard-that-created-fiat-currency/content_1040.html": "The end of the Gold standard that created FIAT currency\nWhat would you say if I were to tell you that 97% of the money that you have or owe, does not actually exist? What if I were to tell you that when you take a loan from a bank for any reason, be it for a home, a car or for your business, that your bank simply creates it out of thin air?\nI have no doubt that your initial response would be that this is absolute rubbish!\n“You are just another ‘conspiracy theorist’ looking for reasons to alarm people for your own ends!”\nReally?\nAre you aware that this is stated clearly, in black and white, on the Bank of England’s website?\n“Saving does not by itself increase the deposits or ‘funds available’ for banks to lend. Indeed, viewing banks simply as intermediaries ignores the fact that, in reality in the modern economy, commercial banks are the creators of deposit money.”\nFor over two thousand years, currency was backed by Gold, this began with the minting of Gold coins. Gold coins were first struck on the order of King Croesus of Lydia (an area that is now part of Turkey), around 550 BC. They were stored in a safe place, of vault, then people could trade using promissory notes, which they could exchange for Gold at any time. This enabled people to trade their Gold, without having to physically carry it around and how paper money began to evolve.\nFast forward to the eighteenth century and Silver was used by the British empire, but due to several factors including was and trade deficits, then, in 1717, Sir Isaac Newton, as master of The Royal Mint, set up a new mint ratio that dramatically reduced the amount of silver in circulation, an act which was followed by the introduction of the new gold Sovereign in 1816.\nThese factors led to the establishment of the world’s first formal gold specie standard in 1821, in which the monetary unit was tied to the value of circulating gold coins.\nThe UK continued to base the British pound on Gold until the crash of 1929, when the economy went in to meltdown, leading the UK leaving the Gold standard in 1931. By this time, the USA was firmly established as the world’s largest economy, a position that it had claimed in 1890. Thereby, most of the world’s currencies were now basing their value on the US Dollar, which was in turn pegged to the value of Gold. This was a role that the USA enjoyed and exploited, as it could control the value currencies around the world, for it’s own benefit.\nHowever, the US economy was also in depression, which resulted in President Roosevelt taking drastic action.\nOn June 5, 1933, the United States went off the gold standard, a monetary system in which currency is backed by gold, when Congress enacted a joint resolution nullifying the right of creditors to demand payment in gold. The United States had been on a gold standard since 1879, except for an embargo on gold exports during World War I, but bank failures during the Great Depression of the 1930s frightened the public into hoarding gold, making the policy untenable.\nSoon after taking office in March 1933, President Roosevelt declared a nationwide bank moratorium in order to prevent a run on the banks by consumers lacking confidence in the economy. He also forbade banks to pay out gold or to export it. According to Keynesian economic theory, one of the best ways to fight off an economic downturn is to inflate the money supply. And increasing the amount of gold held by the Federal Reserve would in turn increase its power to inflate the money supply. Facing similar pressures, Britain had dropped the gold standard in 1931, and Roosevelt had taken note.\nOn April 5, 1933, Roosevelt ordered all gold coins and gold certificates in denominations of more than $100 turned in for other money. It required all persons to deliver all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve by May 1 for the set price of $20.67 per ounce. By May 10, the government had taken in $300 million of gold coin and $470 million of gold certificates. Two months later, a joint resolution of Congress abrogated the gold clauses in many public and private obligations that required the debtor to repay the creditor in gold dollars of the same weight and fineness as those borrowed. In 1934, the government price of gold was increased to $35 per ounce, effectively increasing the gold on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheets by 69 percent. This increase in assets allowed the Federal Reserve to further inflate the money supply.\nThe government held the $35 per ounce price until August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value, thus completely abandoning the gold standard. In 1974, President Gerald Ford signed legislation that permitted Americans again to own gold bullion.\nWhat did this mean for currency?\nFrom the point that the value of currency was completely disconnected from the price of Gold, it was not really genuine currency any more, as it’s value was not based entirely on promissory or subjective value, but in reality, modern currency or ‘FIAT’ currency (taken from the Latin FIAT meaning ‘let it be done’)\nThe most serious impact of FIAT currency is that due its value being based on confidence, or rather, how people feel about it, it can fall in value. If we consider that the value of a British pound has lost over the last century is staggering.\nThe equivalent value of £1 in 1925 today would be £67.57 today, with the US Dollar losing over 96% of its value over the same period!\nThis is the consequence of FIAT currency, but just to put this in to perspective, let’s take a look at the value of a Gold coin.\nBack in its early days, during the Greek/Roman periods, a Gold coin would have bought you a Toga, a belt and a good pair of sandals, today, a Gold coin could more or less, buy you a good suit, a belt and a pair of shoes, hardly any loss in its buying power of 2,500 years!\nThis is because FIAT currency has not intrinsic value and as Government print (or create) more money, the value of it falls continually. It could be argued that every time a Government puts more money in to circulation, or every time a bank ‘creates’ money out of thin air, they are actually stealing the money (albeit worthless in reality) from hard working people. This is a fact that they do not want you to be aware of.\nSo how does it work?\nMost people incorrectly believe that depositors place their savings in to a bank and the bank, then lends it out, making a profit on the difference between the interest received and the interest paid, right? Wrong!\nThis is incidental, in fact, when you go to a bank to borrow money, the bank creates a promissory note on their system, which is transferred to your account, thereby, creating the money that you have borrowed, they then enjoy collecting interest from you for years, or decades, for something that does not exist!\nThere are regulations in place to control the supply of money, this is called ‘Fractional Reserve Lending’ which basically means that banks must hold around 10% of the money that they ‘create’\nFor example, a bank has £100, it can create a loan of £900, keeping 10% of the total, which is £1,000, but some of that £900 that it has lent, will eventually make its way back to the bank, meaning that some of the money that it has ‘created’ can then be used to leverage more loans, creating more money.\nWhat happens to those who refuse to comply to the FIAT system?\nI’m sure that this is just a coincidence (cough, cough) but Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya, to name a few, are or were currencies that were not in debt to the world bank, that is, they did not allow themselves to be in debt to FIAT or ‘created’ money and in fact, before his demise, Gadhafi had announced that he intended to refuse to accept US Dollars as payment for Oil and in future, he would be demanding payment in Gold. I’m sure that this is just a wild coincidence of course, but one worth keeping in mind.\nHow does this affect inflation?\nIf we accept the notion that banks create money, we must also accept that they need people to borrow that money to make a profit. Then we must also accept, that if there is no inflation, or negative inflation, then the cost of borrowing increases, thereby mitigating the benefits of borrowing and actually increasing the cost of the interest payments that borrowers make.\nIf you borrow £100,000 and inflation is around 5%, the value of your loan is falling by 5% per annum, before you have paid off a single penny, plus, your interest payments also fall in real terms, but if there is any period of negative inflation, the value of your loan and payments actually increase, discouraging further borrowing.\nIf we take all of these factors in to account, the real ‘slight of hand’ behind FIAT currency become increasingly obvious, with savers and working people being at the brunt of the consequences.\nAdd to that the fact that FIAT currency creates inflation, because the value of it is constantly falling, the biggest losers are savers and employees, but why is that?\nSavers frequently suffer the devaluation of their savings due to inflation and employees suffer a fall in pay, because the effects of inflation are instant, that is, as soon as prices rise in shops, for energy, cars etc. that extra cost must be borne immediately, but employees must wait and more often than not fight for a pay rise, just to recover the loss they have suffered from inflation, and even when they are successful, those pay rises are always paid in arrears, that is after the fact’ when they have paid more than before, for weeks, months or years, before their pay rise makes up for the shortfall. Businesses on the other hand, raise prices ‘on the fly’ ensuring that their income is adjusted for inflation immediately.\nYou can read the full Bank of England report HERE\nExcellent explanation bravo",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_unraveling-the-complexities-of-migrant-housing-a-closer-look-at-raf-weathersfield/content_483.html": "Unraveling the Complexities of Migrant Housing – A Closer Look at RAF Weathersfield\nIn the realm of the ever-evolving migrant stories that make headlines, there are few that can match the sheer complexity and bewildering twists of the tale that has unfolded at RAF Weathersfield, a disused military base. Amid the cacophony of debates surrounding migrant housing and asylum, this particular scenario stands out, revealing a series of puzzling decisions and human stories that beg for further examination.\nA Plan Gone Awry\nThe saga begins with RAF Weathersfield, once intended to house around 1700 male migrants, an endeavor that quickly proved to be a logistical nightmare. In a truly bizarre turn of events, only 56 migrants were reported to have been successfully relocated to the base. The renovation costs of this venture remain shrouded in mystery, but what is known is that a staggering 1.1 million pound contract was awarded to a company to oversee healthcare services for the migrants. The mind reels at the implications of such a decision.\nFamily Ties or Fleeing Conflict?\nA remarkable twist in this narrative comes from the fact that a third of the male migrants who did manage to move to the site have now departed. Their reasons vary, ranging from claims of modern slavery to subpar conditions. Some have purportedly chosen to live with relatives already established in the country, raising questions about the true motivations behind their journey. Could it be that some migrants are seeking to reunite with family members rather than fleeing from war-torn regions? The possibility that these motivations are not solely driven by conflict becomes increasingly evident.\nModern Slavery and Legal Quagmires\nThe notion of modern slavery further complicates this intricate web. Some migrants insist that only hotels are suitable for their relocation, citing allegations of trafficking and coercion. Even in the absence of concrete evidence, the Home Office issued warnings that military bases and barges could lead to legal challenges if housing individuals who claim to be victims of modern slavery or trauma. Interestingly, the Home Office reportedly chose not to contest these legal claims, sparking debates about its priorities and decisions.\nContradictory Directives\nThe larger conundrum lies in the paradoxical directives that emerge from this situation. The Home Office’s own guidelines seem to suggest that housing individuals who claim to be victims of modern slavery, trafficking, torture, or trauma on military bases or barges is inappropriate. This raises the question: how can this stance be reconciled with the ongoing migrant crisis and the varied experiences of those seeking refuge?\nA Complex Reality\nIn essence, the situation at RAF Weathersfield highlights the intricacies of housing migrants amidst the myriad challenges of the present times. The contradictions between official guidance, legal claims, and the motivations behind seeking asylum underscore the tangled web of issues at play. As the dust settles, it becomes evident that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to addressing the multifaceted nature of migration, and each story deserves a closer examination to uncover the truth.\nThe scenario surrounding RAF Weathersfield reminds us that the migrant narrative is not a linear one; it’s a tapestry woven with threads of hope, desperation, familial ties, legal complexities, and socio-political dynamics. As we continue to grapple with the complexities of migration, let this serve as a reminder that understanding each individual’s story is essential to navigating the way forward in a world where borders and lives intersect.",

I have no idea how many people are joining Reform UK at the moment, but it is invariably a significant number. Something incredible is happening out there and the UK political landscape is about to change for ever.\nAfter 14 years of tory arrogance, lie after lie after lie. Five Prime Ministers, all with an equal record of shame, in 2010 David Cameron promised to get net migration down to tens of thousands, yet we all know what happened since then, millions and millions arriving here just in the last decade, the resident citizens of this country taking second place to those who have arrived and often elbowed their way into our country.\nNet migration, one of the most misused and misleading terms in British politics. Last year alone, 600,000 people left the UK, that would actually mean that net migration of zero would result in 600,000 people arriving. The long-term average of people leaving the UK each year is over 500,000, so even if net migration were zero, in a decade, it would result in over 5 million people arriving, with many encouraging yet more to follow in their footsteps, and that is just with net-zero migration, last year the gross number of arrivals was 1.4m, and that is just the legal migration that we know of.\nWhat about the climate argument? We have just over four weeks to get the message to the masses, no more Net-zero madness, that is costing the UK over £30bn a year, making the friends of the Globalists very rich, whilst those who can least afford it are suffering the most, a nation being enslaved and held to ransom, rather than tangible action to reduce pollution.\nWhere are the calls to reduce plastics? Where are the calls to reduce trade with China, until such time as it stops chocking the planet with hundreds of new coal-fired power stations, that have emitted more pollution in the last five years, than the British empire has since the industrial revolution.\nHaving been born a bred in Northampton, this is my home and what happens here is really important to me, which is why I am already a Parish councillor, enabling me to deal with everyday matters for local people, even though it can be very frustrating at times because I want to do so much, but in reality, there is very little that I can do about anything.\nNothing would give me greater pleasure than to have the opportunity to actually fight for what really matters, including tangible action on climate and pollution, effective policies to end land banking and overseas investors parking their ill-gotten-gains in our housing market, locking young people out. I support incentives and new laws to ensure that young people have as much opportunity to buy or rent a home as their parents.\nI want an end to the trans-ideology being promoted in schools, with instant dismissal for anyone doing so. Safe places for women to be respected and an immediate clampdown on grooming gangs who hide behind fear of racism, and immediate independent investigations into anyone deemed to have covered for grooming gangs.\nUltimately, I urge you to ask yourselves, do you want to vote for a local candidate who has passionate determination to address local concerns, as well as support the major issues and is within a party that has taken the United Kingdom by storm with new ideas that threaten to smash the narrative, or will you vote for the party whose leader does not know what a woman is?\nI need not go on, you know what I stand for, what do you stand for?",

The session began on a sombre note, with Mr Sunak expressing shock at the recent attack on a British soldier in Kent. He offered thoughts and prayers for the soldier’s swift recovery, a sentiment echoed by Opposition Leader Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe Prime Minister then took a moment to wish Team GB good luck as they prepare to travel to Paris for the upcoming Olympic Games, setting a positive tone before delving into the day’s pressing issues.\nThe session quickly turned to domestic matters, with Labour MP Callum Miller raising concerns about water pollution in his constituency. He highlighted that Thames Water had pumped sewage into the River Evenlode for over 2,600 hours in the past year, while simultaneously withdrawing £7 billion in dividends. Miller welcomed the water bill mentioned in the King’s Speech but pressed the Prime Minister on whether he would commit to scrapping Ofwat and replacing it with a tougher regulator.\nMr Sunak responded by acknowledging the importance of the issue, stating that customers should not pay the price for mismanagement by water companies. He announced that immediate steps had been taken to put water companies under a tougher regime and that the Minister for Water would be meeting with the bosses of failing companies to hold them accountable for their performance.\nThe debate then shifted to a more sensitive topic when Labour MP Mia Whim raised concerns about restrictions on puberty blockers for young transgender individuals. She relayed the worries of a constituent who is the parent of a trans child, asking if the Prime Minister would meet with young trans people, their families, and supporting organisations to hear their perspectives on why these restrictions should be reversed.\nMr Sunak approached the question cautiously, emphasising that the government’s guiding principle must be the wellbeing of children. He referenced the Cass Review, which found insufficient evidence on the long-term impact of puberty blockers to determine their safety. The Prime Minister assured that the Health Secretary would consult with organisations supporting young people and families, and promised to arrange a meeting between the MP and the relevant minister.\nThe exchange between the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader Sir Keir Starmer focused primarily on foreign policy, particularly the ongoing situation in Ukraine. Sir Keir commended the UK’s consistent leadership in providing new military capabilities to Ukraine and offered his continued support for such decisions. He urged the Prime Minister to remain responsive to Ukraine’s requests to ensure they can decisively win against Russian aggression.\nMr Sunak expressed gratitude for the bipartisan approach to Ukraine, emphasising the importance of maintaining unity across the House on this issue. He assured that the government continues to engage with Ukraine about their needs in facing Russian aggression.\nThe discussion on Ukraine continued, with Sir Keir inquiring about the Prime Minister’s recent meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He asked whether Mr Sunak had raised the possibility of Germany providing long-range missiles to Ukraine, as the UK, US, and France have done. The Prime Minister confirmed that he had urged all allies at the recent NATO Council meeting to provide further support to Ukraine where possible.\nBoth leaders affirmed their commitment to Ukraine’s path to NATO membership, with Mr Sunak stating unequivocally that it is for NATO allies to decide who becomes a member of the alliance. He highlighted the progress made at the recent summit, where an “irreversible path to membership” for Ukraine was established.\nSir Keir then brought up the complex issue of seizing Russian assets to fund Ukrainian reconstruction. He indicated that thanks to legal and diplomatic work led by the UK, along with Canada and the US, there is now a sound legal basis to proceed with such actions. The Prime Minister welcomed this development, acknowledging the importance of the issue and indicating that discussions were already underway on how to take more effective measures.\nThe conversation then turned to domestic defence matters, with Sir Keir praising the government’s emphasis on the Tempest fighter jet programme. He mentioned initial discussions with Saudi Arabia about their potential participation in the programme and sought confirmation that these conversations would continue. Mr Sunak affirmed the importance of the Tempest programme and indicated that discussions were ongoing, including recent talks at the Farnborough Air Show.\nIn a show of bipartisan support on matters of national security, Sir Keir offered the Opposition’s backing should the Prime Minister need to use his prerogative power to respond militarily to protect British national security, even without prior notice to the House. Mr Sunak agreed on the essential nature of this power and expressed gratitude for the Opposition’s approach to such sensitive matters.\nThe session then moved on to other topics, including concerns about carer’s allowance repayments, raised by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey. He highlighted the case of a constituent facing a large repayment bill from the Department for Work and Pensions, despite earning less than £7,000 a year as a part-time worker while caring for her elderly mother. Mr Sunak acknowledged the importance of the issue and expressed willingness to work across the House to address challenges in the care sector.\nScottish National Party leader Stephen Flynn challenged the Prime Minister on child poverty, referencing a recent campaign appearance with former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Flynn questioned why Labour MPs from Scotland had been instructed to retain the two-child benefit cap, which he argued forces children into poverty. Mr Sunak defended his government’s approach, citing initiatives such as breakfast clubs, the abolition of no-fault evictions, and plans to make work pay. He also pointed out that child poverty in Scotland had increased by 30,000 since the SNP came to power.\nThe session covered a wide range of additional topics, including the situation in Gaza, education funding in Scotland, police funding in London, immigration policy, renewable energy projects, and measures to tackle violence against women and girls.\nThroughout the session, Mr Sunak demonstrated a willingness to engage with opposition parties on key issues while also robustly defending his government’s policies and plans. He repeatedly emphasised the need for change after what he characterised as “14 years of failure” under previous governments, positioning his administration as one of service dedicated to addressing long-standing challenges.\nAs the new Prime Minister settles into his role, it is clear that he faces a complex array of domestic and international challenges. This first PMQs session provided a glimpse into how he intends to navigate these issues, balancing the need for cross-party cooperation on matters of national importance with a determination to implement his own policy agenda.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_anastasiades-faces-money-laundering-reports/content_246.html": "Anastasiades faces money laundering reports\nThe government branded on Saturday media reports linking President Nicos Anastasiades and his law firm to the so-called Troika laundromat as libellous and devoid of reality.\nA report by the Organised Crime and Corruption Project (OCCRP) released on Wednesday linked the president and his law firm with the Troika Laundromat, a network of shell companies that operated from 2006 to 2013 moving at least $4.6 billion and enabling its users to hide assets, evade taxes or launder money.\nIn a statement on Friday, main opposition Akel said it was concerned by the reports which linked Cyprus with money laundering and implicating the president and his law firm in suspicious dealings.\n“The Republic of Cyprus is being derided since it is implicated in suspicious money dealings, as well as Mr Anastasiades himself,” the party said.\nCOMMENT\nI really don’t know why he is surprised, his administration has presided over some horrendous corruption scandals, he lied to the people before the haircut in 2013, promising that it would not happen, then he had the audacity to imply that his hand was forced by the EU, when it has transpired since that he instigated it, not before ensuring that his family and friends had moved their money to safety. More than SIX YEARS later, we have still been kept in the dark about the 5% commission that the Deutsche Bank offered to dump the toxic bonds that the Cyprus Popular Bank and the Bank of Cyprus bought……….who received that money?\nThen he personally pardoned sex offenders, a hit and run driver (Efi Herodotou) who fled the scene, leaving an innocent man to die, then she fled the country for years, on her return when she was jailed, he pardoned her the following year. I’m sure it is no coincidence that her father is an army officer and one of the inner-circle of ‘friends’ who are above the law in Cyprus.\nThen there was the disgrace of the coop bank, which is being revealed to have operated not only with gross negligence, but actions bordering on ‘Loan Sharking’ with some of their overcharges being calculated to be in excess of 40% of many outstanding balances! This has left many people hunted by asset management like Altamira, just as the court fee structure has been changed to make it even more expensive for them to defend themselves, absolutely shameful!\nThere is no transparency in government accounting, no moral compass in domestic policy, Cypriots finding themselves unable to afford a home because under the supervision of this administration, Cyprus is being sold off to overseas investors in exchange for ‘golden Visas’ creating a fake bubble with NO REGARD to the indigenous population that has a right to a home, but all too often cannot afford one.\nYou sir, have a lot to answer for, the public have a right to place their faith in a fair and trustworthy administration, is that really the case?",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_e-cigarettes/content_273.html": "https://youtu.be/XW4duMgxEIo\nAlthough not harmless, the evidence is unequivocal that vaping is much safer than smoking. But misinformation and scaremongering could still be putting people off switching.\nSearch for the term ‘vaping’ online and you’d be forgiven for thinking that it is an activity fraught with risks. The top stories relate to health problems, explosions and that vaping leads to smoking in teenagers. For the average smoker seeking information on vaping, a quick internet search offers little reassurance. Might as well continue smoking, the headlines imply, if these products are so dangerous.\nBut the reality is that they are not. In the past year, more than any other, the evidence that using an e-cigarette is far safer than smoking has continued to accumulate. 2017 saw the publication of the first longer term study of vaping, comparing toxicant exposure between people who’d stopped smoking and used the products for an average of 16 months, compared with those who continued to smoke. Funded by Cancer Research UK, the study found large reductions in carcinogens and other toxic compounds in vapers compared with smokers, but only if the user had stopped smoking completely. A further recent study compared toxicants in vapour and smoke that can cause cancer, and estimated excess cancer risk over a lifetime from smoking cigarettes or vaping. Most of the available data on e-cigarettes in this study suggested a cancer risk from vaping around 1% of that from smoking.\nE-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking because they don’t contain tobacco. Inhaling burnt tobacco – but also chewing it – is hugely damaging to human health. Remove the tobacco and the combustion and it is hardly surprising that risk is reduced. That doesn’t mean e-cigarettes are harmless. But it does mean that we can be relatively confident that switching from smoking to vaping will have health benefits.\nThese new studies and others have influenced policy, at least in the UK. In England, a broad consensus endorsed by many health organisations has existed since 2016 encouraging smokers to try vaping. This year additional organisations, like the Royal College of General Practitioners and the British Medical Association issued new reports also pointing to e-cigarettes as a positive choice for smokers trying to quit. And for the first time, Public Health England included e-cigarettes in its advertising for ‘Stoptober’ an annual stop smoking campaign. In Scotland, a large number of organisations led by Health Scotland issued a statement making clear that vaping is definitely safer than smoking that was also supported by Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer.\nOverseas, many countries still ban e-cigarettes and using them can result in fines or even imprisonment for vapers or vendors. Yet gradually this is changing. 2017 saw a complete reversal of New Zealand’s position on these devices and their new policies look very similar to those in place in the UK. Canada is also legalising e-cigarettes, although details of the regulatory framework are still being ironed out. These countries are following the research evidence and in time others may follow.\nA primary reason for caution in many countries is the fear that vaping will lead to smoking, particularly in young people. This year we did see research suggesting that some teenagers experimenting with vaping go on to smoke when followed up a year later, and this included studies from the UK. There seems little doubt that there are groups of young people susceptible to both. Yet these studies can’t prove that it was the act of trying an e-cigarette that lead to subsequent smoking – many other factors could explain this, including the simple fact that tobacco is still widely available. 2017 saw the publication of the world’s largest study to date of young people and vaping, including over 60,000 teenagers. It found that while experimentation with these products was occurring, regular use by teens who had never smoked remains very low, at less than 1%. Meanwhile in the UK and many other countries like the USA, youth smoking rates continue to decline at an encouraging pace. If vaping was causing smoking, these trends would reverse.\nSo, what is the average smoker to make of the continued controversy, and seemingly insatiable press interest around e-cigarettes? Who should they believe? Good sources of information do exist but they are not prominent enough. We need clear public information, from reputable sources, to shout above the noise and deliver the facts. And these are the facts. If you are a smoker, the best thing you can do for your health and the health of those around you is to stop smoking. If you choose to vape to stop smoking, that’s great, and no one should criticise you for that choice. I think we may well see a public information campaign along those lines in the near future. And from my perspective, it can’t come soon enough.",

His offhand comments surfaced shortly after the Home Office unveiled plans to combat spiking incidents.\nIn an interaction with female attendees at the reception, Cleverly quipped that slipping “a little bit of Rohypnol in her drink every night” wouldn’t constitute a serious offense if it were done in moderation, as per the Sunday Mirror’s report.\nFurthermore, he humorously suggested that the key to a lasting marriage was ensuring his wife remained “mildly sedated,” preventing her from recognizing the presence of better suitors.\nDespite the customary understanding that conversations at Downing Street gatherings are “off the record,” the Sunday Mirror chose to disclose Cleverly’s remarks, considering his official position and the sensitivity of the topic.\nAssociates of Cleverly mentioned that while these comments were made in a private setting, he acknowledged their inappropriateness.\nPreviously emphasizing the importance of addressing violence against women and girls, Cleverly had labeled spiking as a “perverse” crime, yet his recent remarks sparked criticism.\nA spokesperson for Cleverly clarified, “In what was always understood as a private conversation, James, the Home Secretary, tackling spiking made what was clearly meant to be an ironic joke, for which he apologizes.”\nSenior figures from the Labour Party condemned Cleverly’s remarks, denouncing them as “appalling” and highlighting the need for a shift in cultural attitudes toward such issues, starting from the top leadership.\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, expressed disbelief over Cleverly’s comments, particularly considering the severity of spiking as a crime and its impact on women’s lives.\nDespite the government’s pledge to update legislative language to explicitly criminalize spiking and introduce other measures, they fell short of establishing spiking as a distinct offense.\nStatistics revealed a substantial number of reported spiking incidents in England and Wales, predominantly affecting women, often occurring in or around bars and nightclubs.",

Then you are a racist!\n- Do you want borders? Then you are a racist!\n- Do you believe in our heritage? Then you are a racist!\n- Do you believe in equality under the law? Then you are racist!\n- The list goes on and on…………..but take comfort from this strange reality:\nThose who seek to control the narrative, under the guise of misinformation and disinformation are more often than not, the very people who are lying the most and have not doubt that the greatest liar in this country, is desperately rallying around, in a vain effort to hide his own deep, dark, and very disturbing secrets, all will be revealed in the fullness of time………………..\nI was recommended this website by my cousin I am not sure whether this post is written by him as nobody else know such detailed about my difficulty You are wonderful Thanks\nThank you for your comment, this is a serious matter, as there are many people out there of all faiths and races, who are being marginalised by this divisive attitude when dealing with offenders.\nAn offence is an offence, no matter who commits it, so hiding the facts only serves to create speculation and division.",

Anthony Stevens, a 50-year-old member of Wellingborough Town Council from Northamptonshire, was recently arrested for what is being classified as an alleged hate crime after he retweeted a video that criticized the police’s handling of the arrest of a Christian street preacher.\nThe video in question showcased the arrest of Christian preacher Oluwole Ilisanmi, which took place in Southgate, London, back in 2019. This arrest stirred controversy as Mr. Ilisanmi’s Bible was seized by a police officer on accusations of Islamophobia. The preacher was later awarded compensation for wrongful arrest, shedding light on potential religious discrimination within law enforcement.\nCouncillor Stevens shared this video, among others, to his personal Twitter account in May. However, his decision to retweet the video led to unforeseen consequences. He was arrested at his home and taken to a police station for questioning. The arrest has ignited a fierce debate about the boundaries of free speech, the role of social media in political discourse, and the potential implications of sharing content that challenges the actions of law enforcement.\nStevens’ case also intersects with another incident involving his support for fellow Northamptonshire councillor, King Lawal. Lawal, a prominent figure and the only black councillor in the region, faced backlash for expressing his Christian beliefs in relation to LGBT issues. This incident resulted in his suspension from the local Conservative group. Stevens, a firm advocate of free speech, threw his weight behind Lawal by retweeting a petition to reinstate him.\nDuring his interrogation, Stevens was questioned about his support for Lawal and the reasons behind it. He expressed his commitment to the principle of free speech, emphasizing that even when he doesn’t agree with someone’s views, he believes in their right to express them without fear of reprisal.\nAnother significant tweet that came under scrutiny was one in which Stevens shared a video of a man burning a copy of the Quran. He justified this by asserting that he views such actions as part of an individual’s right to free speech within a democratic society.\nStevens’ arrest, reportedly triggered by a complaint from a local Labour Party member, has stirred an outcry from proponents of free speech and civil liberties. He was arrested under suspicion of distributing material that could incite racial hatred, invoking a critical examination of the balance between preventing hate speech and safeguarding the right to political expression.\nLegal experts, including Lord Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions, have called for better training for police officers in understanding the nuances of free speech and political speech. Concerns have been raised that cases like Stevens’ might inadvertently discourage public participation in democratic debates.\nToby Young, the director of the Free Speech Union, argued that Stevens’ arrest underscores the urgent need for proper free speech training within law enforcement. Young expressed concern that without such training, incidents like these could tarnish the fundamental values of open discourse in a democratic society.\nWhile Northamptonshire Police have confirmed the ongoing investigation, the arrest of Councillor Stevens continues to highlight the delicate balancing act between protecting society from hate speech and upholding the principles of free speech and political expression. This case serves as a reminder of the evolving landscape of digital communication and the need for thoughtful consideration of the implications of sharing content that critiques authority or questions societal norms.",

Here’s the formatted text:”What’s the difference between leadership and management? In my opinion, management is a more dictatorial, authoritarian role, and that’s not the role that I like to play in business. I prefer to take on the role of leadership, which is to inspire by example.\nToday, I’m at Kilworth House, meeting a couple of members of my team to discuss where they’re at, where they’re going, what they want to do, and how they’re going to do it. Because when people are part of my team, they are not there for my benefit, as I see it; I’m here for their benefit. My goal is to inspire them, provide direction, and brainstorm ideas because their success is my success.\nAlthough a company is a product of the people within it, sometimes people at the top forget that it’s the people, and the collective efforts of these people, that create the company, not those at the top who may sometimes take them for granted.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_parents-rush-to-pull-children-from-private-schools-as-labour-vows-immediate-fee-hike/content_1207.html": "Parents Rush to Pull Children from Private Schools as Labour Vows Immediate Fee Hike\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through the private education sector, families across the nation are scrambling to withdraw their children from fee-paying schools or expedite the payment of tuition fees. This comes in response to Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to impose a punitive tax raid on private education institutions from “day one” should Labour emerge victorious in the forthcoming general election.\nThe reverberations of Labour’s proposed policy have already begun to ripple through the hallowed halls of Britain’s independent schools. Esteemed headteachers have revealed to The Telegraph that an alarming number of parents are hastily cancelling enrolments for the upcoming September term, gripped by fears that a Labour government could be in power before the start of the summer holidays.\nOthers, in a desperate bid to circumvent the impending financial burden, are racing against the clock to settle their children’s tuition fees well in advance of the looming election date of July 4th – a date that has taken many by surprise, having initially anticipated an autumn poll.\nStarmer’s Resolute Stance on “Straight Away” Tax Hike\nSir Keir Starmer has doubled down on Labour’s commitment to applying VAT to private education fees “straight away” upon assuming office. When confronted by BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme and questioned whether this contentious plan would be implemented on “day one” of a Labour government, the opposition leader remained unflinching, stating: “As soon as it can be done. It is a question of the timetable in Parliament. But these steps are intended to be done straight away.”\nFamilies Flee, Headteachers Lament\nThe consequences of this proposed policy shift are already manifesting, with Silas Edmonds, the principal at the prestigious Ewell Castle School in Surrey, bearing witness to an exodus of pupils. According to Edmonds, parents of children with confirmed places for the upcoming September term have begun withdrawing their enrolments, citing grave concerns over the anticipated cost escalation and pervasive uncertainty.\n“Several year seven families and families of pupils who would have been taking places in sixth form have withdrawn because they are just too worried about this additional cost,” lamented the headteacher of the £20,193-a-year institution.\nIn a bid to prepare for the potential fallout, Edmonds has written to parents this week, following Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s unexpected announcement, warning them that while the school is “hoping for the best,” they are simultaneously “preparing for the worst” should Labour claim victory at the ballot box.\n“We are looking at our finances to see if there is any kind of buffer we can build in to meet parents halfway, but it is going to be tough. I’m really hoping they [Labour] will see sense and realise it’s actually going to cost the Government long term,” Edmonds implored.\nAdvance Fee Payments Surge Amid Uncertainty\nMoreover, the principal has observed a marked uptick in the number of parents rushing to pay tuition fees upfront, a trend he attributes to the mounting sense of trepidation surrounding the potential policy shift.\n“We’ve had a fees-in-advance scheme for a while now because we have been doing horizon scanning, and we saw this coming down the tracks, so we have had a few parents who have already taken advantage of that,” Edmonds elucidated. “A few more have enquired in the past week or two. I suspect there will be more next week.”\nConcerns Ripple Through the Sector\nThe apprehension is palpable across the independent education sector, with Anthony Oulton, principal at Hulme Private Grammar School in Manchester, voicing grave concerns about the potential revocation of acceptance letters in the wake of Labour’s proposed measures.\n“I do wonder and worry about how many parents with offers for September starts might contact us in the next week. There is just so much uncertainty about this; it’s really, really unhelpful,” Oulton bemoaned.\nAt Hulme Grammar School, approximately a third of the student body receives bursaries, while a “good number” are beneficiaries of fully paid scholarships. Last year alone, the institution allocated a staggering £750,000 to support pupils from lower-income families, enabling them to access a private education.\nParental Panic and Uncertain Futures\nA report by wealth manager Saltus last week revealed a sobering statistic: more than a quarter of parents intend to withdraw their children from private schools and enrol them in local state institutions should Labour’s VAT levy come into effect.\nAmong those grappling with this agonising decision is Loveena Tandon, a 44-year-old mother of two hailing from India. Tandon, whose children currently attend private schools in London and Surrey, has conceded that she is actively considering “all options” in light of the potential fee hike.\nTandon’s calculations have led her to a staggering realisation: a 20% rise in tuition fees would necessitate her finding an additional £14,000 per term – a burden she fears may be insurmountable.\n“I am going to be having conversations with my parents, with my mother and sister in Mumbai, and we are going to have serious conversations about the possibilities there [in India] and also going to be looking at possibilities in the state sector,” Tandon confided. “I will also look at what I can do with my career.”\nThe ripple effect of Labour’s proposed policy is already reverberating through parental circles, with Tandon revealing that “a lot of parents are already inquiring about state schools. Everyone is doing whatever they can, but the bottom line is a big chunk of parents cannot afford this.”\nTandon’s plight is emblematic of the growing unease among families, some of whom are already grappling with the financial pressures of private education. “Some are already going to state schools and they are already feeling the pressure and crumbling,” she lamented.\nGrassroots Resistance and Policy Backlash\nIn a defiant act of resistance, Tandon has joined forces with Education not Taxation, a grassroots campaign spearheaded by incensed parents seeking to compel Labour to reverse its contentious policy stance. The group’s petition, urging the opposition party to abandon the proposed VAT hike, has garnered a groundswell of support, surpassing 120,000 signatures, with a further 2,000 individuals pledging their backing in the past 24 hours alone.\nDavid Woodgate, the chief executive of the Independent Schools’ Bursars Association, representing a staggering 1,100 private schools, has launched a scathing critique of Labour’s costing projections for the policy. Woodgate argues that the party has failed to account for the substantial cost to the state should tens of thousands of private school pupils be forced to migrate to the state sector.\nLabour has claimed that the policy will generate £1.7 billion in revenue, with £1.6 billion stemming from the imposition of VAT and £100 million arising from the abolition of business rate relief. However, Woodgate contends that the “genuine real risk of an exodus of pupils into the state sector has not been factored into Labour’s numbers.”\n“The figure could be well under £1 billion in reality, which is not very much money to fund the policies which Labour wants to fund from it,” he cautioned.\nState School Capacity Concerns\nAmidst the maelstrom of discontent, a Local Government Association spokesman has sounded a sobering warning to parents contemplating a last-minute exodus from private institutions, citing the risks associated with such a move.\n“With 80% of secondary schools now academies, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with demand. Councils have a legal duty to ensure capacity, but currently have no powers to open new secondary schools or direct academies to expand,” the spokesman elucidated.\nThe spokesman underscored the fundamental principle that “every child should have a fair chance of getting into their parents’ preferred school,” emphasising that councils and schools alike “work extremely hard to try and ensure that as many pupils as possible are allocated their first preference.”\nHowever, the spokesman’s remarks were punctuated by an urgent call for reform: “This ruling needs to be amended as soon as possible to ensure as many children as possible get the places they want.”\nAs the nation hurtles towards the pivotal general election, the private education sector finds itself embroiled in a maelstrom of uncertainty, with families grappling with agonising decisions and the prospect of upheaval looming large on the horizon. Whether Labour’s proposed policies will withstand the groundswell of parental opposition remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the reverberations of this contentious issue will continue to echo through the hallowed halls of Britain’s independent schools for the foreseeable future.",

This threatens to create economic turmoil in the coming decades.\nThe share of over 65s is set to rise dramatically from 19% now to around 25% by 2040, an “unprecedented degree” of societal ageing, according to a new report from the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS). With such a dramatic demographic shift comes increased government spending on healthcare, pensions and elderly care support. Total expenditure could quadruple from £225 billion today to an eye-watering £950 billion by 2072.\nMore worryingly, this spending looks set to double as a percentage of GDP to 21% over the period. That means the tax burden will have to increase on a shrinking pool of workers to pay for growing elderly care costs, risking lower growth and living standards.\nThe UK’s Economic Growth Imperative\nTo offset the impact of an ageing population, the UK economy would need to achieve herculean growth rates of 2.9% a year for the next half century, according to the CPS. But with the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasting average growth of just 1.4% over the next five years, such transformational growth looks highly ambitious.\n“We risk accepting a doom loop of low growth and high elderly care costs,” says Karl Williams, deputy research director at the CPS. “But if we take action in areas like boosting birth rates, productivity and technology, an ageing crisis doesn’t have to be inevitable.”\nPolicies to Boost Birth Rates\nWith UK birth rates lagging far below the 2.1 “replacement level”, an obvious solution is to encourage people to have more children. This would grow the tax base and boost economic output.\nIn parent-friendly France, which has Europe’s highest fertility, families get tax breaks. Similar financial incentives in the UK could make it more affordable for parents, given the high costs of housing, childcare and living faced by young families today.\n“The government should focus on lifting barriers around affordability,” argues Phoebe Arslanagić-Little of campaign group Boom. Specific policies could include more affordable childcare, housebuilding, flexible work and NHS IVF treatment.\nHowever, experts warn such natalist policies haven’t reversed birth decline in countries like Finland. “There’s no magic bullet,” says Professor Michael Murphy.\nThe Limits of Migration\nAllowing more working-age migrants into Britain is another oft-touted solution from lobby groups. However, this “Ponzi scheme” only delays the problem as migrants also eventually require elderly care, experts argue.\n“What matters is not the size of the workforce but its productivity,” says Williams. Recent decades of high migration have coincided with dismally low productivity growth in the UK.\nThe Promise of Technology\nRaising productivity will therefore be key. One route is through more automation, like industrial robots in manufacturing. On a global scale, the UK currently underutilises such labour-saving technologies.\nDeploying more robots could boost industry. Meanwhile “AI software can also take on repetitive tasks to allow humans to focus on higher-value work,” explains Williams.\nHowever, experts studying automation in Japanese elderly care homes found clunky robots often created more work for human staff. More modest innovations like sensor monitors and paperwork automation software may be more useful than humanoid machines.\nCombining Solutions\nWith Baby Boomers retiring en masse over the next 20 years, Britain will probably need to combine higher birth rates, productivity gains and some increased migration to generate the growth required to avoid an elderly care funding crisis.\nThe scale of the demographic challenge is daunting but must be tackled now, Williams urges. “I’m hoping the sheer scariness of the numbers will jolt people into action.”",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-britain-is-no-longer-a-rich-economy/content_397.html": "Why Britain Is No Longer a Rich Economy\nThe Illusion of Wealth: Unpacking Britain’s GDP Per Capita\nIntroduction\nBritain’s GDP per capita is an often-cited statistic that appears to paint a picture of prosperity. At $46,400, it suggests that, on average, each British citizen enjoys a comfortable standard of living. However, beneath this seemingly rosy surface, the reality is far more complex. The United Kingdom’s economic journey has been marked by periods of growth, innovation, and challenges. In this blog post, we will delve into the intricacies of Britain’s economic landscape, exploring factors that have shaped its current state, including wealth concentration, low productivity, austerity measures, and the impact of Brexit.\n1. The Concentration of Wealth\nOne of the key aspects of Britain’s economic landscape is the concentration of wealth. While the GDP per capita figure may appear impressive, it masks the stark disparities within the country. A significant portion of the nation’s wealth is concentrated in the southeast, which contributes to 47% of the GDP while housing just 37% of the population. This region is home to opulent country estates, prestigious educational institutions, and high-paying jobs at global corporations. However, beyond this prosperous enclave lies a different reality.\n2. Economic Challenges Post-2008\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 dealt a severe blow to the UK’s economy. In response, the government adopted a policy of austerity, focusing on reducing deficits rather than fostering productivity or addressing aggregate demand. The consequences were dire, with real wages declining for six consecutive years and household income stagnating for over a decade. In comparison to other countries, the UK’s household income growth lagged significantly, exacerbating income inequality and diminishing living standards.\n3. The Productivity Conundrum\nProductivity is a vital driver of economic growth and well-being, and here the UK faces significant challenges. Despite periods of strong productivity growth in the early 2000s, the global financial crisis triggered a prolonged slowdown. The UK’s productivity growth rate from 2009 to 2022 was among the slowest in the G7 nations. Had productivity continued to grow at pre-crisis rates, GDP per person would be significantly higher today.\n4. The Role of Investment\nOne crucial factor contributing to the UK’s productivity gap is low investment. Investment in capital goods, technology, and human capital is essential for driving productivity growth. However, the UK lags behind comparable nations in business investment rates, R&D spending, and intangible investments such as market research and training. This underinvestment, coupled with a skills deficit, contributes to the UK’s productivity woes.\n5. Brexit’s Impact\nBrexit, the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, has introduced a new layer of economic uncertainty. The Bank of England estimates that Brexit reduced investment by 25% in the five years leading up to 2021. Importantly, Brexit has also affected immigration, exports, and foreign investment, potentially reducing the UK’s long-term economic growth prospects.\n6. Austerity and Social Impact\nAusterity measures, implemented to reduce budget deficits, have had limited success in promoting economic growth. Instead, they have been criticized for increasing poverty levels, particularly child poverty. The number of children living in relative poverty has increased since the onset of austerity measures, with approximately 4.2 million children currently living in poverty.\n7. A Comparison with Other Anglosphere Nations\nWhen compared to other Anglosphere countries, the UK lags behind in terms of wealth, productivity, and living standards. Americans, for instance, enjoy a significantly higher average income and greater productivity. Housing affordability is also a pressing issue in the UK, affecting young people’s financial prospects.\nConclusion\n– Britain’s GDP per capita of $46,400 may seem impressive at first glance, but it masks significant economic challenges within the country.\n– Wealth in the UK is highly concentrated, with the southeast accounting for 47% of GDP and 37% of the population.\n– The UK’s economic woes began with the 2008 financial crisis, leading to austerity measures that negatively impacted real wages and household income.\n– Low productivity growth has been a persistent issue, with the UK’s productivity lagging behind its peers.\n– Insufficient investment in capital goods, technology, and human capital has contributed to the productivity gap.\n– Brexit has introduced economic uncertainty, reducing investment and affecting immigration, exports, and foreign investment.\n– Austerity measures, while aimed at reducing deficits, have been criticized for increasing poverty levels, especially child poverty.\n– A comparison with other Anglosphere nations reveals the UK’s lagging wealth, productivity, and living standards.\n– To secure a more prosperous future, the UK must prioritize balanced economic policies that promote investment, productivity, and social well-being.\n– While challenges persist, there is hope that the UK can navigate towards a more productive and equitable decade ahead.\nBritain’s GDP per capita figure may initially suggest prosperity, but a deeper analysis reveals a complex economic landscape marked by wealth concentration, low productivity, austerity’s social impact, and the fallout from Brexit. The UK’s journey from an industrial powerhouse to its current state underscores the importance of balanced economic policies that prioritize investment, productivity, and social well-being. As the UK navigates its economic future, there is hope that a more productive and equitable decade lies ahead. However, addressing the challenges highlighted in this post will be essential to achieving that vision.",

He began by expressing deep sympathy for the affected families, acknowledging their unimaginable pain and calling for space to grieve, but no apology for ignoring everyone when he visited.\nStarmer emphasised the importance of allowing authorities to conduct their investigation without prejudice, stating, “The time for answering those questions is not now.” He reminded everyone that a compromised trial would ultimately deprive victims and their families of the justice they deserve.\nThe Labour leader then turned his attention to what he described as a “tiny, mindless minority” who had inflicted further suffering on the grieving Southport community. He condemned the actions of thugs who travelled to Southport, throwing bricks at police officers who had just dealt with an attack on children in their own community.\nStarmer highlighted several incidents across the country, including attacks on mosques, flares thrown at Winston Churchill’s statue, and a Nazi salute at the Cenotaph. He stressed that these actions reveal the true nature of those involved.\nYou are highlighting a handful, yes in the order of things a handful of people who have expressed their anger badly, but hear this Mr. Marxist, those who you have seen are a mere fraction of the total people who have had enough.\nFollowing a meeting with senior police and law enforcement leaders, Starmer announced plans to establish a national capability across police forces to tackle violent disorder. This initiative will include shared intelligence, wider deployment of facial recognition technology, and preventative action through criminal behaviour orders.\nIn short, this anti-British Marxist is announcing his own personal Stasi and declaring war on the British people, that will not go down well sir and I can tell you this for a fact:\nYOU WILL LOSE!\nThe Labour leader also addressed social media companies, warning that violent disorder incited online is a crime and that the law must be upheld everywhere. What he actually means is that he will attack any platform that allows people to speak the truth. Let’s not forget that people can communicate in many was and you cannot stop the masses from finding out what is happening, no matter how much your corrupt mainstream media lie to them.\nResponding to questions from the media, Starmer clarified that the focus is not on introducing new legislation but on using existing powers more effectively. He emphasised the importance of a coordinated response and swift action in cases of violent disorder.\nStarmer also addressed concerns from the British Muslim community, pledging to take every necessary step to ensure their safety. He reiterated his commitment to showing “who we are” in response to far-right provocations.\nIn reality, Keir Stalin was saying that he is going to protect Muslims from the ‘Far Right’ or more correctly, anyone who disagrees with our country being forced to its knees by those who have decided to take over….which will NEVER happen, EVER!\nWhen asked about apparent inconsistencies in police responses across different regions, Starmer explained that the afternoon’s meeting was aimed at creating a more unified national approach. He expressed support for increased use of criminal behaviour orders to prevent known offenders from travelling to cause trouble.\nStarmer declined to comment directly on statements made by other political figures, including Nigel Farage. Instead, he emphasised his focus on the victims, their families, and the police officers who responded to the incident in Southport.\nOnce again, we saw his concern when he visited, it was an insult, pure and simple.\nThe Labour leader concluded by distinguishing his approach from what he called the “performative politics” of previous governments. Starmer advocated for a “politics of service,” which involves working collaboratively to address challenges and ensure the country’s safety while respecting citizens’ values.\nDoes anyone really believe that?\nSummary:\n• Starmer expressed sympathy for families affected by the Southport stabbing incident, calling for space to grieve and emphasising the importance of a fair trial.\n• He condemned far-right rioting in Southport and other areas, describing it as criminal behaviour rather than legitimate protest.\n• A national capability across police forces will be established to tackle violent disorder, including:\n– Shared intelligence\n– Wider use of facial recognition technology\n– Preventative action through criminal behaviour orders\n• Starmer warned social media companies about their responsibility in curbing online incitement of violence.\n• The focus is on better use of existing powers rather than introducing new legislation.\n• He pledged to protect the British Muslim community from far-right attacks.\n• Starmer advocated for a more coordinated national police response to such incidents.\n• He emphasised his focus on victims, families, and responding police officers rather than commenting on statements by other political figures.\n• Starmer contrasted his “politics of service” approach with the “performative politics” of previous governments, emphasising collaborative problem-solving.",

The official, who has been suspended by the Home Office, allegedly contacted a vulnerable man and asked for £2,000 in return for approving his refugee application.\nThe BBC, which uncovered the alleged cash-for-residency scandal, said that sensitive Home Office records were utilised as part of the attempted scam. Police have been called in to investigate by the Home Office, which said that it expected “the highest standards” from its staff.\nStephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said that the allegations were “deeply concerning” and the Government had “lost control” of the asylum system.\n‘He offered me a positive decision’\nThe intended victim, using the pseudonym Renas to protect his identity, said that he was contacted by a worker employed as an asylum “decision maker” in the north of England. Renas said he received a call in early March in which it was claimed that “95 per cent of people like you” have their applications refused. The “decision maker” then allegedly suggested a direct payment would guarantee success.\n“He said I could be sure he would refuse my application,” Renas said. “But if I could help him, he could help me and he asked for some money. He asked for £2,000.\n“He basically offered me a positive decision.”\nRenas, a former journalist, said at first he thought it was “a total scam”, but it became clear to him the man on the phone did work for the Home Office.\n“He had all my information. He gave me very specific details from my application.”\n‘Targeted the most vulnerable people’\nRenas recorded a subsequent video call he received from the “decision maker”, which he passed to police. The footage appears to show an individual using a laptop that has official Home Office software containing case files.\n“He targeted the most vulnerable people in society,” Renas said.\n“There will be other asylum seekers who are going through the same process, or maybe there are some people who have already been scammed like this. I feel this is my responsibility to inform them.\n“I was persecuted in my home country by the authorities. I was already afraid of the Home Office and other institutions here.”\nRenas raised concerns with his solicitor, who alerted the authorities. In a statement, Lancashire police said: “We can confirm we have arrested a man on suspicion of misconduct in public office, suspicion of money laundering, bribery, and computer misuse offences.\n“Officers from Lancashire Constabulary alongside partners from the Home Office arrested the man, in his 30s, in the Ramsgreave area of Blackburn. An investigation remains in its early stages and enquiries are ongoing.”\nA Home Office spokesman said: “We expect the highest standards from our staff to ensure asylum claims are properly considered, decisions are sound and that protection is granted to those who genuinely need it.\n“The member of staff was arrested and suspended. It would be inappropriate to comment further as the matter is subject to a live police investigation.”",

The turnout was a modest 39.7% of the electorate, with a staggering 73.9% of the total votes cast as postal votes. Moreover, an astonishing 95% of these postal votes were in favour of George Galloway, the victorious candidate.\nMainstream Parties’ Vote Collapse\nThe collapse of the traditional Labour and Conservative vote share has been nothing short of remarkable. These two parties, which collectively secured 82.8% of the vote in the previous election, managed to garner a mere 19.7% this time around. Such a dramatic shift in voter allegiance between elections is highly improbable, leading many to question the legitimacy of the results.\nAllegations of Electoral Interference\nSuspicions have been raised regarding the potential interference of certain demographic groups in the electoral process. Julia Hartley-Brewer, a prominent commentator, shared two leaflets distributed by the George Galloway campaign, each targeting distinct voter segments. While one leaflet appealed to mainstream British voters with promises of law and order and support for businesses, the other was tailored to a specific demographic comprising 20-25% of the electorate, featuring Arabic phrases and references to Gaza and Palestine.\nPostal Vote Irregularities\nPerhaps the most alarming allegations surround the postal voting process. Reports have emerged of gangs following postal workers and intimidating residents into handing over their postal votes immediately after delivery. If these claims are substantiated, it would cast serious doubts on the integrity of the postal voting system.\nCalls for Immediate Action\nIn light of these developments, there have been urgent calls for the government to take swift action to address the potential electoral irregularities and safeguard the democratic process. Critics argue that the current administration has allowed the situation to deteriorate to an unacceptable level, and immediate reforms are necessary to restore public confidence in the electoral system.\nImplications for Future Elections\nThe Rochdale by-election has raised crucial questions about the vulnerability of the UK’s electoral process to external influences and potential fraud. As the nation prepares for future elections, it is imperative that these concerns are thoroughly investigated and addressed. Failure to do so could undermine the very foundations of the country’s democratic principles and erode public trust in the integrity of the electoral system.\nConclusion\nThe political apathy with regards to anything to do with extremism has been to say the least, staggering. It is clear that someone like George Galloway has absolutely no moral compass, no sense of national pride and once again he has demonstrated that he is prepared to go to any lengths to cause disruption within the UK.\nAs we approach the next general election, we must not be complacent about the political crisis that we are facing, however this is not just an isolated situation, no matter how much we want to be accommodating to other cultures and beliefs, there will invariably come a time when we will need to be decisive about what where we stand on this matter, no matter how much we may be encouraged to make allowances.\nThis is not a mindset that intends to integrate, of that there is no doubt and whilst there are many people of a certain demographic who have no interest in religious doctrine, there is a strong wave of social and cultural pressure that has resulted in those who are considered ‘moderate’ are gradually becoming radicalised.\nMulticulturalism does not work, it has created a disunited kingdom and it will take brave leadership to rectify decades of capitulation to those who are using our freedom against us.\nStop postal votes now!\nPostal votes are a licence to commit election fraud!",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_why-boris-was-always-going-to-be-ousted-from-power/content_601.html": "Why Boris was always going to be ousted from power\nThe Shock that rang alarm bells with the Left Wing Political Classes on the 23rd June 2016, laid the foundation for what we have witnessed this week. The pack of Baying Wolves were NEVER going to accept the will of the British Public. With the willing assistance of the media, they successfully terrified the masses that leaving the EU would result in a decline in the British economy that would be so great, it would be little more than the entire country falling off a cliff-edge.\nThe conspiracy began immediately, with David Cameron resigning immediately, giving way to Theresa May, who entered Number 10 with a convincing rhetoric, that she would implement the will of the people, but in reality, her agenda was to scupper Brexit in every way possible, even calling an election when she had no reason to, giving away her majority, creating a hung parliament, frustrating every possibility of us leaving on terms that were to be dictated by us, then attempting on THREE occasions, to present us with a watered-down neutered deal, that would have been little more than remain in disguise.\nPersonally, I initially had misgivings about Boris, after all, he was a remainer and having a sense for his desire to be Prime Minister, I suspected that he only championed the ‘Leave Campaign’ for the publicity, expecting to lose, as Cameron had, but the British public made their feelings overwhelmingly clear, what was he to do now?\nFollowing his election to Prime Minister by the party, we then witnessed the blatant frustration of every effort made by Boris to secure Brexit, by the left and the treacherous John Bercow. As the drama unfolded before our eyes, we were presented with the greatest defiance of Democracy in generations, but Boris did not capitulate, he took the brave step to prorogue Parliament, then call an election, which saw him win a shock majority, winning by a landslide, the left would NEVER accept that, Democracy in Parliament? That goes against the mindset of these Champagne Marxists.\nFinally, Boris successfully helped the UK to finally leave the clutches of the infernal EU, albeit with a few loose ends and a large compromise on our Fishing industry, which did not go down very well, after all, the EU has enjoyed fleecing our Fishing waters for decades, thanks to an incompetent decision by Edward Heath in the 70s.\nWhat are the new rules on fishing?\nThe post-Brexit trade deal outlines new rules on fishing:\n- EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come\n- But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters\n- That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021\n- After that, there’ll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU\n- The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026\n- But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters\nThe UK successfully left the EU on the 31 January 2020 at 11:00 pm GMT.\nThe backlash from the left was thwarted by the onslaught of Covid, but even through this terrible pandemic, Boris was pressured by those in his party who had a mindset of ‘Control not Leadership’ to terrify the nation, to lock them down and to dictate terms to an entire nation. The over-zealous Scientific advisers were issuing daily reports of doom and gloom, forcing the hand of the PM to implement lockdown, but let us not forget that their every prediction was WRONG!\nWe were presented with figures based on ‘Died within 28 days of testing positive’ a very cunning way to exaggerate the numbers exponentially. In fact, as we now know, the number of those who had died from Covid, rather than with Covid, with no pre-existing conditions was relatively small.\nDuring this period, the first fatal blow was struck against the Prime Minister, during a working day, he stepped out in to the garden of Number 10, where he was presented by a cake, for his birthday, on the 19th June 2020.\nBoris Johnson was ‘ambushed with cake’ at lockdown birthday event, claims Tory MP\nBirthday gathering was not ‘pre-mediated’ party, says loyal backbencher\nBoris was courteous enough to stay for 10 minutes, long enough for one of the plotters to capture the event from a window at Number 11, they must have been jumping for joy, they were now armed with a political bombshell, which would be released at a time of their choosing. When the story hit the news, we were presented with claims of parties during lockdown, with the Prime Minister being subsequently proved to have never attended, or even being aware of. This may very well have been his plotters and members of the Civil Service, taking steps to tarnish the credibility of the Prime Minister in his absence.\nThe media frenzy that followed, was successful in causing the PM serious damage, if enough mud is thrown by a determined media, some of it will invariably stick. The campaign against him was relentless, but the final straw came when the story broke about Chris Pincher, who was appointed Deputy Chief Whip by the PM. It later transpired that the PM was told of allegations against Chris Pincher, making the PM guilty of negligence, but the key word is ‘allegation’ if Chris Pincher were an ethnic female, who was refused a position based on allegations, what would have they said in that case?\nAt 18.02 on Tuesday the 5th of July, the Chancellor Sajid Javid, resigned, signalling the start of the final showdown against the Prime Minister, he was shortly followed by Rishi Sunak, the Snake who was clearly plotting against the PM for a long time, he even registered his domain ‘ReadyforSunak’ in November last year.\nThese people have unilaterally taken steps to depose a Democratically elected leader, in the middle of a war in Ukraine, an act that has Putin positively beaming with joy, I think that says it all.\nHere is the list of Traitors, in ancient Rome, it was “Et Tu Brute” but this week, “It was you Remainers”\nBoris Johnson’s premiership collapsed after a string of resignations, including from the chancellor, the health secretary and a number of Conservative ministers and aides. Here is a list of those who resigned.\nMichelle Donelan – 8.51am Thursday\nLess than 48 hours after she was appointed education secretary, Donelan quit, saying Johnson had put the cabinet in an “impossible situation”.\nJames Cartlidge – 8.09am Thursday\nThe courts minister said it was obvious that it was “no longer even remotely possible” to give Johnson a chance and put aside his “previous transgressions”.\nThe MP for South Suffolk said he had initially “felt duty bound to remain in post” because of the “challenging circumstances facing the criminal courts”, but that that position was “clearly untenable”.\nhris Philp – 8.02am Thursday\nUrging the prime minister to deliver the gambling review “in full and undiluted”, the minister for technology and the digital economy said he could no longer serve in government on Thursday morning because of the importance of “integrity, honesty and trust in politics”.\nGuy Opperman – 7.50am Thursday\nThe pensions minister told Johnson: “The government simply cannot function with you in charge.”\nGeorge Freeman – 7.21am Thursday\nThe minister for science, research and innovation wrote: “Enough is enough. This can’t go on. The chaos in No 10, the breakdown of cabinet collective responsibility, the abandonment of the ministerial code, the defence of impropriety and defiance of parliament are all insults to the Conservatism I believe in and stand for.”\nDamian Hinds – 7.15am Thursday\nThe security minister was the third minister to go on Thursday morning. The MP for East Hampshire said there had been a “serious erosion” of standards.\nHe wrote: “More important than any government or leader are the standards we uphold in public life and faith in our democracy and public administration. Because of the serious erosion in these, I have come to the conclusion that the right thing for our country and our party is for you to stand down, as party leader and prime minister.”\nHelen Whately – 6.49am Thursday\nThe MP for Faversham and Mid Kent resigned as a Treasury minister, saying of Johnson: “There are only so many times you can apologise and move on. That point has been reached.”\nBrandon Lewis – 6.47am Thursday\nThe Northern Ireland secretary resigned early on Thursday morning, telling the prime minister that government required “honesty, integrity and mutual respect”.\nIn his resignation letter, the MP for Great Yarmouth told Johnson he had “given you, and those around you, the benefit of the doubt”.\n“I have gone out and defended this government both publicly and privately. We are, however, now past the point of no return. I cannot sacrifice my personal integrity to defend things as they stand now. It is clear that our party, parliamentary colleagues, volunteers and the whole country, deserve better.”\nGareth Davies – 11.54pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Grantham and Stamford resigned late on Wednesday night as a parliamentary private secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care – “not a decision I have taken lightly”, he tweeted.\nEdward Argar – 10.45pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Charnwood handed in his resignation as a minister of state for health. He wrote: “It is now the time to consider the future, and the ‘big call’ of how we face that future with integrity, and in that context I fear that a change is needed in order for our party to continue to deliver on our shared ambitions for our country.”\nSimon Hart – 10.33pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire resigned as secretary of state for Wales. He wrote in his letter to Johnson, published on Twitter: “I have never been a massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing change.\n“Colleagues have done their upmost [sic] in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible.”\nDanny Kruger – 9.36pm Wednesday\nThe Devizes MP quit as a parliamentary private secretary (PPS) for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities after the sacking of his boss, Michael Gove.\nJames Daly – 9.25pm Wednesday\nThe Bury North MP quit as a PPS at the Department for Work and Pensions.\nDavid Mundell – 9.22pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale quit as trade envoy to New Zealand.\nJacob Young – 8.39pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Redcar resigned as a PPS in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.\nPeter Gibson – 5.15pm Wednesday\nGibson resigned as a parliamentary aide in the Department for International Trade and cited the damaged caused by the government’s failure to ban conversion practices for trans people as one of the reasons.\nRuth Edwards – 4.57pm Wednesday\nEdwards said she was “heartbroken” to learn that the prime minister had appointed Chris Pincher to deputy chief whip despite knowing about serious allegations of sexual misconduct.\nSara Britcliffe – 4.49pm Wednesday\nBritcliffe said she was resigning as a parliamentary aide in the Department for Education “with a heavy heart”. She added: “This self-inflicted crisis risks undoing all of that. It’s time to draw a line.”\nMark Fletcher – 4.27pm Wednesday\nThe parliamentary aide in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy accused the prime minister of being an “apologist” for someone who has allegedly committed sexual assault.\nJames Sunderland – 4.09pm Wednesday\nThe MP resigned as a parliamentary aide in the environment department, without giving a reason.\nMike Freer – 4.03pm Wednesday\nFreer resigned as minister for exports and equalities, saying: “I can no longer defend policies I fundamentally disagree with.” He also said the party was moving too far away from one-nation conservatism. He accused the government of “creating an atmosphere of hostility for LGBT+ people”.\nRachel Maclean – 3.38pm Wednesday\nThe MP resigned as a minister for safeguarding in the Home Office, saying she could not make progress with her job while Johnson remained in office. Maclean said he should resign for the good of the country and party.\nMark Logan – 3.32pm Wednesday\nThe MP resigned as a parliamentary aide in the Northern Ireland Office, saying the party needed to accept the reality staring it in the face. He said there was only so much that his constituents and the public “to accept or ignore.”\nCraig Williams – 3.22pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Montgomeryshire said he was resigning as parliamentary private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer. In a letter posted to Twitter, he said: “After the recent vote of confidence, I had given my support to you, with one last benefit of the doubt. I believed it was right that we draw a line under previous events and focus on rebuilding trust with the public and focusing on delivering good policies. It has now become apparent over recent days, that this is becoming impossible. It is therefore with deep regret that I resign from your government.”\nFay Jones – 3.07pm Wednesday\nThe parliamentary private secretary to the leader of the House of Commons issued a half-resignation, saying she would step down if the prime minister is not gone by Thursday.\nDuncan Baker – 3.04pm Wednesday\nBaker resigned as a parliamentary private secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.\nIn a statement on Facebook, the MP for North Norfolk said: “In my short time as the MP for North Norfolk, I have spoken out time and time again on matters relating to integrity, leadership and trust. I must remain true to my values and principles. I have felt for a considerable while that the situation cannot go on. I do not have confidence in the prime minister and resign my role as a PPS in the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.”\nMims Davies – 2.26pm Wednesday\nDavies resigned as employment minister, saying the Conservative party needs a “fresh start”.\nIn a tweet, the Mid Sussex MP said: “I have tendered my resignation from the government from a role I have cherished for the last three years. I thank everyone @DWP from bottom of my heart for all their work, friendship & support. But Conservatives needs a fresh start & I can see no other way forward than this.”\nKemi Badenoch, Neil O’Brien, Alex Burghart, Lee Rowley and Julia Lopez – 2.25pm Wednesday\nFive ministers resigned at once, signing a joint resignation letter saying “it has become increasingly clear that the government cannot function given the issues that have come to light”. The five are: Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister; Neil O’Brien, the levelling up minister; Alex Burghart, the skills minister; Lee Rowley, the business minister, and Julia Lopez, the minister for media, data and digital infrastructure.\nSelaine Saxby – 1.30pm Wednesday\nThe MP for North Devon has resigned as a parliamentary private secretary to George Eustice, the environment secretary, saying “trust, truth and integrity” were vital in politics.\nDavid Johnston – 1.25pm Wednesday\nThe Wantage MP quit as parliamentary private secretary at the Department for Education.\nClaire Coutinho – 1.21pm Wednesday\nThe MP for East Surrey has resigned as a parliamentary private secretary to the Treasury. Writing on Facebook, she said: “I firmly believe that what we need now, as we deal with the twin challenges of war in Europe and global inflation, is a laser-like grip on reforming our public services so that they work better for our constituents and focus on charting a path to prosperity through what is an increasingly challenging global outlook. I think the events of recent weeks and months are preventing us from doing that.”\nStuart Andrew – 12.42pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Pudsey resigned as a junior housing minister, saying “our party, particularly our members and more importantly our great country, deserve better”. In a tweet, he said: “There comes a time when you have to look at your own personal integrity and that time is now.\nJo Churchill – 12.01pm Wednesday\nThe MP for Bury St Edmunds since 2015 resigned as an environment minister, criticising Johnson’s “jocular, self-serving” approach to leadership. In her resignation letter, she wrote: “Recent events have shown integrity, competence, and judgment are all essential to the role of prime minister, while a jocular self-serving approach is bound to have its limitations.\n“Our beloved country is facing an uncertain future and strong headwinds, a clear, selfless vision is needed. The country and party deserve better and so with a heavy heart I have decided to resign.”\nVictoria Atkins – 11.21am Wednesday\nThe MP for Louth and Horncastle has resigned as a justice minister, telling Johnson: “I can no longer pirouette around our fractured values.” She added: “We can and must be better than this.”\nJohn Glen – 11.06am Wednesday\nThe MP for Salisbury has resigned as a Treasury minister, saying Johnson’s “poor judgment” made it “impossible for me to square continued service with my conscience”. “After much thought and with deep regret, I must inform you that I have made the difficult decision to resign from the government,” he wrote.\nFelicity Buchan – 11.05am Wednesday\nThe MP for Kensington has resigned from her role as parliamentary private secretary to the business secretary. In a letter posted to Twitter, she said “the current situation is untenable”.\nRobin Walker – 9.43am Wednesday\nThe schools minister resigned saying the government had been “overshadowed by mistakes and questions about integrity”. In his resignation letter, he said: “Recent events have made it clear to me that our great party, for which I have campaigned all of my adult life, has become distracted from its core missions by a relentless focus on questions over leadership.”\nThe loss of Sunak and Javid reflected “a worrying narrowing of the broad church that I believe any Conservative government should seek to achieve”, he added.\nWill Quince – 8.25am Wednesday\nThe children’s minister resigned saying he had “no choice” after he appeared on television to defend Johnson using Downing Street briefings that were not true. His letter said: “Dear prime minister. Thank you for meeting with me yesterday evening and for your sincere apology regarding the briefings I received from No 10 ahead of Monday’s media round, which we now know to be inaccurate.” The Colchester MP is facing a threat from the Lib Dems at the next election.\nLaura Trott – 8.06am Wednesday\nThe MP for Sevenoaks is a rising star from the 2019 intake who resigned as a parliamentary aide to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. She is a former special adviser to David Cameron, and stepped down saying: “Trust in politics is – and must always be – of the utmost importance, but sadly in recent months this has been lost.”\nAlex Chalk – 10.47pm Tuesday\nThe solicitor general for England and Wales stepped down from his role after weeks on resignation watch. The Cheltenham MP will be defending a marginal seat against the Lib Dems. He said: “Government duty cannot extend to ‘defending the indefensible’.” Chalk wrote that the “cumulative effect of the Owen Paterson debacle, Partygate and now the handling of the former deputy chief whip’s resignation, is that public confidence in the ability of No 10 to uphold the standards of candour expected of a British government has irretrievable broken down”.\nTheo Clarke – 10.02pm Tuesday\nAnother 2019 MP, Clarke is a niece of Jacob Rees-Mogg and was a trade envoy to Kenya. She stepped down from that role citing concerns over how sexual harassment allegations were handled. “As one of the party’s new female MPs and a member of the women and equalities select committee, I take allegations of sexual misconduct very seriously,” she said. “To learn that you chose to elevate a colleague to a position of pastoral care for MPs, whilst in full knowledge of his own wrongdoing, shows a severe lack of judgment and care for your parliamentary party. I was shocked to see colleagues defending the government with assurances that have turned out to be false.”\nVirginia Crosbie – 8.58pm Tuesday\nCrosbie resigned as parliamentary private secretary at the Wales Office, saying Johnson’s continued premiership risked “irrevocably harming this government”. She wrote that she was “forced to say the sheer number of allegations of impropriety and illegality” centred around Downing Street and Johnson’s premiership made his position untenable. “I am of the view that if you continue in office then you risk irrevocably harming this government, and the Conservative party and will hand the keys of Downing Street to a Labour party unfit to govern.”\nNicola Richards – 8.27pm Tuesday\nRichards, another parliamentary private secretary to the Department for Transport, quit saying: “At a time where my constituents are worried about the cost of living and I am doing my best to support them, I cannot bring myself to serve as a PPS under the current circumstances, where the focus is skewed by poor judgment that I don’t wish to be associated with.”\nSaqib Bhatti – 7.51pm Tuesday\nThe parliamentary private secretary to the health secretary quit saying his conscience would not allow him to continue to support this administration. He resigned his role with a statement saying that “recent events have undermined trust and standards in public life”.\nJonathan Gullis – 7.40pm Tuesday\nGullis has been one of Johnson’s staunchest supporters in the Commons, but even he stepped down as a parliamentary private secretary to the Northern Ireland secretary. He said the Conservatives had been too focused on reputational damage over governing. “It is for this reason I can no longer serve as part of your government,” he said.\nBim Afolami – 7.28pm Tuesday\nThe vice-chair of the Conservatives in effect resigned from his position live on TalkTV, saying he had lost confidence in the prime minister and would be stepping down from his role. He said: “I think what’s been very sad over the recent allegations about the former deputy chief whip and other things that have happened over the last few weeks is that I just don’t think the PM has any longer, not just my support, but I don’t think the support of party, or indeed the country, any more … it has become clear after losing the support of two of his closest cabinet colleagues that the time has come for him to stand down.”\nAndrew Murrison – 7pm Tuesday\nMurrison, a former defence minister, stepped down as a trade envoy to Morocco with concerns that he could no longer defend the prime minister. He said the “last straw in the rolling chaos of the past six months” was “the unjustifiable implication of Lord McDonald’s letter to the parliamentary committee for standards this morning.\n“Others must square, as best they can, their continuing enjoyment of your patronage with their personal sense of decency, honour and integrity but I no longer can,” he added.\nRishi Sunak – 6.11pm Tuesday\nSunak was long known to have had tensions with the prime minister over the direction of economic policy, arguing for measures to bear down on inflation while Johnson wanted immediate tax cuts. He resigned citing differences of opinion over the economy, but also saying: “The public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously.”\nSunak will now be considered a future leadership contender, with his decision to walk out perhaps winning him back some credibility with colleagues after the furore over his wife’s non-dom tax status. He has been close to resigning on several occasions but had appeared to be trying to make things work, with a joint economic speech pencilled in for the coming weeks.\nHowever, his patience ran out after the latest scandal – the handling of the Chris Pincher affair. As chancellor, he was known for the furlough scheme and quick action to prop up businesses during the pandemic. His low points have been getting a fine over attending the prime minister’s birthday party in lockdown and the criticism over his own and his wife’s tax affairs.\nSajid Javid – 6.02pm Tuesday\nThe former chancellor resigned once before over his differences with Boris Johnson, only to be replaced by Sunak. This time he was the first to trigger a walkout, calling Johnson’s competence into question. “The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction,” he said. “I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership – and you have therefore lost my confidence too.”\nAs health secretary, Javid has focused on trying to fix health inequalities and dealing with the Covid treatment backlog. But his resignation letter concluded he could no longer serve under Johnson. Like Sunak, he will be considered a potential leadership contender to succeed the prime minister, but, like the former chancellor, he has questions over his own former tax affairs, having admitted he was a non-dom for six years before he was an MP.\nCONCLUSION\nThese people have placed the UK and ultimately the world in greater danger, as Boris was the only leader to have been training and arming Ukraine, long before the invasion by Putin. Now that he has gone, I have no doubt that the treacherous EU will put pressure on Ukraine to concede territory to Russia, so that they can declare the war over and resume their naive dependence on Russian Gas, before they run out.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_they-are-coming-for-your-children/content_1021.html": "They are coming for your children\nProposed Children’s Well-being and Home Schools Bill Raises Concerns Over Parental Rights\nA controversial piece of legislation, the Children’s Well-being and Home Schools Bill, is scheduled for its second reading in Parliament. The bill, which represents its first major parliamentary vote, is expected to pass with a significant majority. Critics argue this legislation could fundamentally alter the relationship between parents and the state regarding children’s education and welfare.\nThe proposed legislation introduces several significant changes to the current educational framework, including the implementation of a national identity card system for all children, the creation of a comprehensive register tracking children’s locations, and regular local authority inspections of homeschooling environments. Perhaps most significantly, the bill would transform homeschooling from a parental right to a privilege requiring local authority permission.\nThis legislative shift follows a historical trajectory of changing parent-state relationships in British law. Under previous legal frameworks, parents were presumed to be the most appropriate caregivers and decision-makers for their children, with state intervention reserved for exceptional circumstances such as cases of incompetence or specific medical situations. However, this presumption was significantly altered during the Tony Blair era through the Children’s Act, which effectively repositioned the state as the primary arbiter of children’s best interests.\nUnder the current system, parents maintain certain rights, particularly regarding educational choices through homeschooling. The proposed legislation would remove this final autonomous decision-making power from parents. Local authorities would be empowered to assess and potentially decline homeschooling applications based on their evaluation of parental suitability.\nCritics of the bill argue that the criteria for determining parental “suitability” for homeschooling could be problematic. There are concerns that personal beliefs, political affiliations, or religious views might influence these determinations. The legislation could potentially impact parents who disagree with certain aspects of the state education system, whether related to religious education, sex education, or other contentious curriculum matters.\nThe implications of this legislation extend beyond homeschooling rights. Under the proposed system, parents who disagree with school policies or teaching approaches would have limited recourse if their homeschooling application is denied. The national identity card system would track children’s whereabouts, and non-compliance with educational directives could result in legal consequences for parents.\nThis legislative proposal represents a significant shift in the balance of power between parents and the state regarding children’s education. While supporters might argue these measures ensure educational standards and child welfare, critics contend it removes fundamental parental rights and could lead to a more restrictive educational environment.\nThe bill’s introduction raises broader questions about the role of the state in education and the extent of parental authority over their children’s upbringing. It continues a trend of increasing state oversight in areas traditionally considered within the domain of parental discretion.\nParents concerned about these changes are being encouraged to contact their Members of Parliament before the second reading vote. The outcome of this vote could have lasting implications for the future of homeschooling and parental rights in the United Kingdom.\nThis legislation marks a significant milestone in the ongoing discussion about the balance between state oversight and parental autonomy in children’s education. Whatever the outcome of the vote, it is likely to have lasting implications for the relationship between families, educational institutions, and the state in Britain.\nKey Implications of the Children’s Well-being and Home Schools Bill\nSummary\nThe proposed legislation represents a fundamental shift in the relationship between parents, children, and the state in the United Kingdom. If passed, it would significantly alter the current educational landscape and parental rights framework.\nKey Points:\n* The bill would eliminate automatic parental rights to homeschool, replacing them with a permission-based system requiring local authority approval and ongoing oversight.\n* A new national identity card system would be implemented for all children, along with a comprehensive register tracking their locations and educational status.\n* Local authorities would gain expanded powers to conduct regular inspections of homeschooling environments and could deny or revoke homeschooling privileges based on their assessment of parental suitability.\n* The legislation continues a trend that began with the Children’s Act under Tony Blair’s government, further shifting the presumption of “best interest” decision-making from parents to the state.\n* Parents who disagree with state educational policies would have limited recourse if denied homeschooling permission, potentially forcing compliance with educational approaches they oppose.\n* The implications extend beyond homeschooling, potentially affecting parents’ ability to influence or opt out of controversial aspects of their children’s education.\n* Non-compliance with the new regulations could result in serious legal consequences for parents, including potential criminal charges.\nThis legislation marks a crucial moment in British educational policy, with lasting implications for parental rights, educational freedom, and the state’s role in child-rearing decisions.",

From inspiring terrorist atrocities to inciting persistent hatred, these extremist ideologues are having a devastating impact on victims and eroding the pluralistic values that define modern Britain.\nToday, the independent Commission for Countering Extremism has issued a clarion call for robust action in a landmark report titled “Challenging Hateful Extremism.” Drawing upon an extensive 18-month national consultation that garnered nearly 3,000 responses from the public, victims, practitioners and academics, the Commission’s findings paint a harrowing picture of the rising tide of extremism in our communities.\nAt its core, the report proposes reframing our counter-extremism efforts around tackling “hateful extremism” – a set of corrosive behaviours and beliefs that actively target out-groups perceived as threats. Hateful extremism is summarised as conduct that can “incite and amplify hate, engage in persistent hatred, or equivocate about and make the moral case for violence” rooted in “hateful, hostile or supremacist beliefs” which causes tangible “harm to individuals, communities or wider society.”\nThe harms inflicted by hateful extremists are both pernicious and far-reaching. Victims have shared harrowing tales of abuse, harassment and violence levelled against them for simply expressing their beliefs or identity. Jewish MPs have been subjected to vitriolic antisemitic vitriol. Ahmadi Muslim children face taunts at school. Farmers have been targeted by animal rights activists. Even those striving to build bridges between communities have found themselves in the extremists’ crosshairs.\nMoreover, the extremists’ toxic narratives are metastasizing online and infiltrating the mainstream. Far-right agitators promote racism cloaked in warnings about cultural threats. Islamists construct a bunker mentality centred on Muslims versus the corrupting West. The far-left conflates anti-imperialism with antisemitism. Their reach is staggering – some provocative social media posts garner over half a million views as thousands attend real-world rallies.\nProsecutions for stirring up hatred are at unprecedented levels, with all convictions last year involving anti-Muslim content. Religious hate crimes have surged over 200% faster than other forms since 2015. As the Lead Commissioner Sara Khan starkly warns, “We must not allow extremists to normalise their deep-seated hatred in our country.”\nRecognising these grave threats, the Commission advocates for a bold new strategy centred on a “rights-based and proportionate response” to hateful extremism – one that robustly upholds civil liberties and democratic pluralism while firmly challenging those who undermine these values.\n“Countering extremism is about standing up for our wonderfully diverse country – plural, tolerant, and broad-minded,” asserts Commissioner Khan. “It’s a positive vision for an inclusive society where we embrace each other’s differences and encourage people to find positive solutions together.”\nCrucially, the report emphasises that this campaign against hateful extremism must be a “whole society” effort propelled by leaders across all sectors. The Commission is urging the Home Secretary to spearhead a specialised “hateful extremism task force” modelled on the government’s serious violence initiative. This cross-disciplinary group would coordinate the national response, oversee policy development, and rapidly address emerging situations.\nPublic bodies, too, must recognise victims of hateful extremism and provide adequate support services. Faith leaders must firmly denounce extremists perverting their traditions. Social media giants like Facebook and Twitter need innovative methods beyond content removal to promote healthier online discourse. Charities and rights groups should robustly fund and participate in counter-narrative programmes. As one respondent articulated, Britain needs “an inclusive society where individuals are encouraged to talk through positive solutions.”\nUnderpinning all these efforts, the Commission underscores the necessity of a statutory footing to escalate its work fighting hateful extremism. Enshrined in law with parliamentary accountability, an independent Commission could relentlessly advance new research, interventions and oversight to turn the tide against this menace.\nAmong its forthcoming priorities, the Commission will spearhead the development of a comprehensive working definition of hateful extremism by Spring 2020 to facilitate consistent identification.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-october-riots-of-1931-in-cyprus/content_750.html": "1931 Cyprus revolt\nThe 1931 Cyprus revolt or October Events (Greek: Οκτωβριανά, Oktovriana) was an anti-colonial revolt that took place in Cyprus, then a British crown colony, between 21 October and early November 1931. The revolt was spearheaded by Greek Cypriot nationalists who advocated the Enosis (Union) of the island with Greece. The defeat of the rebels led to a period of repressive British rule known as “Palmerocracy” (Παλμεροκρατία), that would last until the beginning of World War II.\nBackground\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Cyprus was nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire, while in fact being administered by the British Empire as agreed in the Cyprus Convention of 1878. On 5 November 1914, the Ottomans entered the conflict on the side of the Central Powers, prompting Britain to void the Cyprus Convention and annex the island as the two states were now at war. In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Greece in exchange for the Greek intervention into the World War I on the side of the Triple Entente. The Greek government refused the offer as at the time it was embroiled in a deep internal crisis known as the National Schism. Cyprus had already been described as a bargaining chip for negotiating with the Greeks when it was offered in exchange for the deep water port of Argostoli in 1912.\nFollowing the end of the war Britain received international recognition of its claims to the island at the 1923 Conference of Lausanne. Greece was the only country that could potentially contest the decision, based on the fact that four fifths of its population were ethnically Greek. However at the time Greece faced economic ruin and diplomatic isolation as a result of a disastrous defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), thus Greek envoys made no mention of Cyprus at the conference. Cyprus then attained the status of a crown colony and the number of the Cypriot Legislative Council members was increased in favor of British officials. The aforementioned setbacks did not put a halt to the spread of the Megali Idea (Great Idea) and the closely related Enosis (Union) ideologies, the ultimate goal of which was the incorporation of all areas populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state. The November 1926 appointment of Ronald Storrs (a philhellene) as the new governor of Cyprus, fostered the idea among Greek Cypriot nationalists that British rule would be a stepping stone for the eventual union with Greece.\nTheir relationship was to sour in 1928, when Greek Cypriots refused to take part in the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the British occupation of Cyprus. Greece once again appealed for calm, limiting the spread of anti-colonial articles in Greek Cypriot newspapers. Education became another arena of conflict with the passage of the Education Act, which sought to curtail Greek influence in the Cypriot school curricula. The Church of Cyprus which at the time played an important role in the social and political life of the island became one of the bastions of Greek nationalism. Cypriot irredentists also lamented the supposedly preferential treatment of Malta and Egypt at the expense of Cyprus. Relations worsened further when the British authorities unilaterally passed a new penal code which permitted among other things the use of torture. In 1929, Legislative Council members Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos and Stavros Stavrinakis arrived in London, presenting a memorandum to the secretary of colonies Lord Passfield which contained demands for Enosis. As with previous such attempts the answer was negative.\nConflict\nIn September 1931, Storrs blocked a Legislative Council decision to halt tax hikes that were to cover a local budget deficit. Greek Cypriot MPs reacted by resigning from their positions. Furthermore, on 18 October, Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos called Greek Cypriots to engage in acts of civil disobedience until their demands for Enosis were fulfilled. On 21 October, 5,000 Greek Cypriots, mostly students, priests and city notables rallied in the streets of Nicosia while chanting pro–Enosis slogans. The crowd besieged the Government House, following three hours of stone throwing the building was set on fire, the rioters were eventually dispersed by police. At the same time British flags were stripped from public offices across the country, often being substituted with Greek ones. Order was restored by the beginning of November.The British accused the Greek general counsel in Nicosia Alexis Kyrou (a Greek nationalist of Cypriot descent) of instigating the revolt. Kyrou had indeed worked behind the scenes to create a united opposition front against the British prior to the revolt, in direct disobedience to the orders he received from Athens. A total of 7 protesters were killed, 30 were injured, 10 were exiled for life, while 2,606 received various punishments ranging from prison terms to fines on account of seditious activities.\nThe British obsession of balancing the budget, increasing taxes, and using Order-in-Council measures played an important part in the Greek-Cypriots’ decision to seek a greater say in the political and administration affairs of their country. However, Britain was not prepared to relinquish their hold on power.\nThe enosists (unionists) saw this as a wonderful opportunity to push their case for union with Greece. Their actions would test British resolve who used force to quell Greek-Cypriot nationalism resulting in Governor Storrs (November 1926- October 1932) dissolving the Legislative Council (LC).\nA crowd had gathered outside the Commercial Club in Nicosia on October 21, 1931 to hear the news that members of the LC had resigned over the budget. Speeches made inside the club criticized the injustices of British rule and shouts for enosis with Greece could be heard outside in the street. The crowd increased from a few hundred to a few thousand. A priest “mounted the makeshift platform and declared a revolution was to be underway.” A Greek flag was flung which the priest kissed symbolising the Cypriots demands for enosis with mother Greece. They were continual cries “To Government House, To Government House” where protestors saw this building as a symbol of British rule.\nPolice learned that a large number of demonstrators was approaching Government House, so additional police was placed at the entrance to stop them from entering the Governor’s residence. The protestors broke through the police line where they shouted enosis and demanded the Governor to come out and hear them. Storrs was prepared to listen to their grievances, so as long as they maintained a ‘respectful distance’ by inviting one or two of their leaders. However the situation turned nasty when some demonstrators started throwing bricks which smashed windows and someone got on top of the roof of Government House unfurling the Greek flag. Storrs issued instructions that force should be used to disperse the crowd.\nAdditional police reinforcements were brought to stop the stone-throwing demonstrators who had smashed many windows of Government House and even telephone equipment had been destroyed. The Colonial Secretary’s car along with some abandoned police cars had been torched. Unfortunately, the fire spread to Government House, which eventually was engulfed in flames.\nThe Riot Act was read in English and Greek, ordering the demonstrators to disperse, they refused to listen. Police fired a volley of shots resulting in 7 men being wounded and “two collapsed to the ground.” The rifle volley had caught the crowd by surprise who scattered into the streets of Nicosia. However this did not save Government House. The British Telegraph newspaper ran headlines such as ‘A Capital under Mob Rule’ and ‘Incendiarism by Cyprus Rioters’ to portray the Greek Cypriots in a negative light.\nStorrs was worried that this rebellion might spread to other parts of the island. A curfew was proclaimed on October 22 with notices plastered on walls in both Greek and English in Nicosia. However, troubles broke out in Larnaca, Famagusta, Kyrenia, Limassol and Paphos that continued until early November. Storrs took the drastic step of deporting the ringleaders George Hajipavlou, Dionysios Kykkotis, Theofanis Tsangarides, Theofanis Theodotou, Theodoris Kolokassidis, and the two bishops of Kition and Kyrenia to Malta barring them from returning to Cyprus. He believed that such a measure would defuse the political tensions on the island.\nTo complicate matters, the Greek Consul Alexandros Kyrou left the island accused of being involved in the “anti-British disturbance.” The British revoked his authority (exequatar) as Consul where he would never be allowed to resume his diplomatic post in Cyprus. Kyrou’s involvement would have angered the Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos who saw this as undermining his nations good relations with Britain.\nThere was a permanent garrison in Cyprus consisting of three officers and 123 men stationed in the Troodos Mountains which was immediately summoned to Nicosia. Storrs telegraphed for additional British troops from Egypt to be dispatched by air and also the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean fleet to send an aircraft carrier. British troop and naval reinforcements from outside began to arrive and slowly established some semblance of law and order on the island. RAF airplanes flew over Cypriot villages to keep a watchful eye on the situation from the air.\nAt the end of the demonstrations, some 30 people were wounded and six Greeks killed. More than 2,000 rioters were convicted who served sentences of varying periods. A “reparations Impost law levied fines of £34,315 on towns and villages held to be collectively responsible for seditious actions.” The idea of collectively punishing towns and villages for disloyal action was unjust and could only harm the relations between the British and Greek-Cypriots.\nStorrs appreciated “the goodwill of the large Muslim population and other minorities towards the Government never wavered throughout the disturbances.” There was no suggestion that the demonstrations had been ‘premeditated’ or ‘prearranged.’ The serious troublemakers were ‘roughs’ and ‘students’ where “respectable citizens either kept out of the way, in order to avoid the stigma of disloyalty, cheered for union.” According to Storrs, the idea of union may not have had the support with some sections of the Greek-Cypriot community who probably prospered under British rule.\nThe Greek press fully supported the Greek-Cypriots’ action for enosis and criticised the actions of the British troops on the island. In a speech to the Greek parliament on November 18, Eleftherios Venizelos criticized the stance of the Greek press towards the British administration in Cyprus and British Government. Whilst he sympathised with the position of the Greek-Cypriots, he would not allow organisations to use Greek soil for insurrection in Cyprus. It was up to Britain to decide whether to keep Cyprus or not and its responsibility to help the Cypriots realize their aspirations. Venizelos disapproved of the Greek-Cypriot demonstrations of October 1931 and wished to maintain friendly relations with Britain. He continued to display his ambivalence towards the Cyprus question as he did during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919.\nThe October riots of 1931 shook the British administration to its core thus forcing Governor Storrs to take strong energetic measures against the rioters and also leading to the dissolution of the LC. This was the first time the Greek-Cypriots challenged British authority , however, the issue of enosis remained alive in the national consciousness of Greek-Cypriots for another two decades when they commenced their war of independence from British rule in April, 1955.\nAftermath\nThe revolt led to the dismissal of Kyrou whose actions had inadvertently damaged both the Enotic cause and the Anglo–Hellenic relations. The revolt also dealt a blow to Storrs’ career, he was soon transferred to the post of Governor of Northern Rhodesia. The Legislative Council and municipal elections were abolished, the appointment of village authorities and district judges was relegated to the governor of the island. Propagating Enotic ideas and flying foreign flags was banned as was the assembly of more than 5 people. The new measures were aimed at suppressing the operation of the Orthodox church and communist organisations. Censorship had a severe effect on the operation of newspapers especially those associated with left wing politics. Cyprus thus entered a period of autocratic rule known as Palmerokratia (Παλμεροκρατία, “Palmerocracy”), named after governor Richmond Palmer, which started shortly before the revolt and would last until the beginning of World War II. The revolt has been described as the most severe anti-colonial movement that Britain faced in the interwar period. The revolt is known in Cypriot historiography as Oktovriana (October Events).\nMonuments commemorating the October Events were erected in Strovolos and Pissouri in November 2007 and October 2016 respectively.",

It signifies the UK has entered its first technical recession since the economy locked down four years ago.\nGDP per head, which gauges economic growth adjusted for population size, is seen as a good indicator for living standards because when an economy generates more value per person annually, that generally translates into higher household incomes.\nGrant Fitzner, the ONS’s chief economist, said: “What matters for living standards and ultimately things like public finances is whether, adjusted for population changes, you are growing or shrinking.”\nMr Fitzner also cautioned that economic inactivity was a major factor hindering growth. The UK remains the only G7 country yet to return to pre-pandemic employment levels.\nHe said: “If more people were working, consuming, producing, we would have higher GDP numbers. The fact activity fell significantly post-pandemic and has only partly recovered is one factor underpinning weaker growth. That would also underpin weaker consumer spending, with fewer people employed and spending.”\nThe data also showed the economy barely grew in 2023, expanding just 0.1% across the whole year.\nExcluding the pandemic, this is the weakest annual growth since the 2009 financial crisis.\nJames Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The big picture is Britain remains a stagnation nation, with few signs of a recovery to get the economy out of it.”\nWeaker growth implies the Bank of England may be compelled to cut interest rates faster to support the economy.\nHowever, BoE policymaker Megan Greene warned Thursday there was no guarantee it would cut rates when inflation hit 2%. Ms Greene said consumer price rises falling to the BoE’s 2% target was insufficient to “declare victory” and start lowering borrowing costs.\nStatisticians said the quarterly decline was driven by a broad fall across all sectors, including a 0.2% services drop and 1.3% construction fall in the final three months. Housebuilding has now declined for over a year.\nThe ONS said a large retail sales decline across the quarter hit the economy amid a disappointing Christmas season where households brought forward gift-buying for November’s Black Friday deals.\nPeople also spent less on hair and beauty treatments over Christmas, the ONS said.\nThere was evidence more parents pulled children from school early before the holidays, highlighting ongoing attendance concerns since lockdown.\nThe figures come at the end of a crucial economic data week for the PM in which inflation stayed steady but rising sickness continued to hurt the economy.\nIt comes as Jeremy Hunt prepares his Budget next month. The Telegraph reported in January the Chancellor was prepared to squeeze departments further to allow tax cuts against a worsening economic backdrop.\nThe output drop last quarter suggests the Office for Budget Responsibility will likely downgrade its 0.7% growth forecast this year.\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Mr Sunak’s economic plan was now “in tatters”, with the PM failing to deliver on a pledge to grow the economy.\nShe added: “This is Rishi’s recession and the people will pay the price.”\nMr Hunt insisted there were “signs the economy is turning a corner”. He added growth would strengthen over coming years, wages were rising faster than prices, mortgage rates were down and unemployment remained low.\nHe said: “Although times are tough for many families, we must stick to the plan – cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy.”\nSeparate figures from the European Commission suggest Germany’s economy will grow slower than expected this year, dealing a blow to Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nThe Commission slashed its German growth forecasts for 2024 by over half, from 0.8% to 0.3%.\nIt warned high interest rates, labor shortages and weak confidence were constraining growth in Europe’s largest economy.\nThe Commission also said escalating Middle East conflict risked upending inflation fighting at a crucial time.\nFurther disruptions from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea “could bring renewed stress to supply chains, hampering production and adding price pressures,” it said in its winter forecast.",

The alleged plan involves a federal government offer to eliminate all personal debts, funded by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under “the World Debt Reset program.” However, the catch is that individuals would have to forfeit ownership of all property and assets forever and participate in a strict COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, raising concerns about personal freedoms and the direction of global governance.\nA Secretive Plan Unveiled\nThe whistleblower, a member of the LPC’s Strategic Planning Committee, which operates under the control of Canada’s Office of the Prime Minister (PMO), has brought to light a plan that could have far-reaching consequences. The whistleblower claims that the second wave of COVID-19 will be hyped up with increased testing around the end of November. What follows is a disturbing road map for the future:\n1. Phase in secondary lockdown restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas, and expanding outward by November 2020.\n2. Rush the acquisition or construction of isolation facilities across every province and territory by December 2020.\n3. Predict a surge in daily new cases of COVID-19, exceeding testing capacity and leading to increased COVID-related deaths by the end of November 2020.\n4. Enforce a complete and stricter secondary lockdown by the end of December 2020 or early January 2021.\n5. Reform and expand the unemployment program into a universal basic income program by Q1 2021.\n6. Project a mutation of COVID-19 or co-infection with a secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) by February 2021, leading to a third wave with higher mortality and infection rates.\n7. Anticipate daily new cases of COVID-21 and related hospitalizations exceeding medical care facilities’ capacity by Q1-Q2 2021.\n8. Implement enhanced lockdown restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) and impose full travel restrictions, including inter-province and inter-city travel, by Q2 2021.\n9. Transition individuals into the universal basic income program by mid-Q2 2021.\n10. Expect supply chain breakdowns, inventory shortages, and large economic instability by late Q2 2021.\n11. Deploy military personnel into major metropolitan areas and all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints, restrict travel, and provide logistical support by Q3 2021.\nThe Shocking Trade-Off\nPerhaps the most alarming aspect of this plan is the proposed trade-off. In exchange for debt forgiveness and access to a universal basic income, individuals would be required to forfeit ownership of all their property and assets forever. Additionally, they would be compelled to participate in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would grant them unrestricted travel and living rights, even during full lockdowns, through the use of a photo ID known as Canada’s HealthPass.\nResistance and Concerns\nThe whistleblower has revealed that approximately 30% of committee members oppose this plan, but their concerns have been dismissed. It was implied that the agenda would move forward regardless of objections and that this roadmap could extend beyond Canada to other nations.\nConcerns raised by committee members include questions about who would become the owner of forfeited property and assets, as well as the fate of lenders and financial institutions. Shockingly, those who refuse to participate in the World Debt Reset program, HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule may face indefinite lockdowns or even relocation to isolation facilities, with the seizure of their assets.\nConclusion\nThis revelation has sent shockwaves across Canada and beyond. The implications of such a plan are profound and have raised concerns about personal freedoms, individual rights, and the direction of global governance. As the world grapples with the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to remain vigilant and informed about the decisions made by our leaders. The future, as outlined in this alleged plan, remains uncertain, and the voices of those who question it cannot be ignored.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_its-time-that-we-addressed-our-energy-crisis-sensibly/content_1233.html": "Its time that we addressed our energy crisis sensibly\nI believe that it’s time we had a really sensible approach to our energy issues, because this madness of taking hundreds of thousands of acres of our farmland to put windmills and solar panels that cannot guarantee continued energy and continue to precipitate the need for gas and coal-fired electricity just doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. Personally, I am concerned about the amount of farmland we are using. If you’ve taken a look at the foundations for one of these enormous wind turbines, you’ll see that for the current wind turbines being installed everywhere, we’re looking at somewhere around 800 cubic metres of concrete and who knows how much steel in between that is buried into the ground. That will destroy that farmland indefinitely, and yet most of the time these wind turbines aren’t actually working.\nWe’re in this situation because 20-odd years ago, plans were not put into place to build new nuclear power stations, and we have become dependent on importing gas and imported energy. This is not where we should be. A country like the UK should not be dependent on anyone else for energy or food, and food is the one that really concerns me, but we’ll cover that separately.\nYou may or may not be aware of Rolls-Royce modular nuclear reactors. We have advanced so much in our nuclear energy, and these modular reactors are absolutely incredible. They are built off-site in a factory. It takes around four years to prepare the site and two years for construction. The reactors are taken, as the name suggests, in modular form and then literally put together on site. So we’re looking at a total timeframe of 6 years. I’m not sure if that can be cut down a little more, but they have a small footprint, they don’t look offensive, and they will supply energy 24/7 for 50 or 60 years.\nI do believe that these could solve our initial problem or our current energy problem, and at the rate that we are going, I do believe that we will have a much cleaner alternative at the end of the life cycle of the current nuclear reactors.\nFor those of you who are not aware, the nuclear reactors we have at the moment operate on something known as nuclear fission, which is actually the splitting of an atom. So effectively, how nuclear reactors work is they create a mini atomic explosion in a controlled manner to generate energy. Whereas nuclear fusion, which has been proved to work but is going to need a lot more research until we get there, actually works by fusing atoms together, creating implosion. There is no need—whereas nuclear fission requires uranium which then results in nuclear waste—nuclear fusion runs on hydrogen. It is completely safe. If anything goes wrong, then the process simply stops without any toxic fallout. It really is the energy of the future, and we should be investing everything we possibly can into achieving energy independence through nuclear fusion in the future.\nBut it is still years away, and in the meantime, we do need modular nuclear reactors around the country. I’m not sure what the exact figure is for the number we would need throughout the UK to ensure that we are energy independent. At the same time, not only can they provide energy, but they can also provide a clean source of hydrogen which can then be used for everything from running cars to running boilers. So the prospect is so promising, and it is political and financial madness not to be going full-on for nuclear reactors throughout the UK.\nWe are very advanced. Our modular nuclear reactors are absolutely incredible, and within five or six years, if it were handled properly, we would no longer be dependent on any other country for our energy. And yet we have these people who are in cloud-cuckoo-land because they are destroying our farmland. Our food production, which is less than 50% and falling, is critical, and yet they persist with soiling our countryside with these ugly contraptions and taking farmland and using them not just for solar farms but for wind farms as well, causing all sorts of other forms of pollution because these things are not recyclable. And there are thousands of them now. What is going to happen to them at the end of their life?\nSo unfortunately, unless people speak up about this, then things will get from bad to worse. We haven’t really made our way of life cleaner. All we’ve done in reality is subcontract anything that is not clean to other nations. We have our own oil, we have our own gas, and yet we’re not using it, but we are paying more to buy it from other countries. The gas that comes from the US costs us more than our own, which is beneath our very feet. It is literally political madness and financial suicide to keep going down the road that we are heading now.\nI would urge you to take some time to look into the difference between nuclear fusion and nuclear fission because it’s very interesting. And also perhaps take the time to look up Rolls-Royce nuclear modular reactors. They are absolutely fascinating. They’re British, they’re made in this country, and they could solve our energy problems within five or six years, if not less. That’s all for now. Thank you very much and bye-bye. I’ll see you next time.",

The reality is that we have a situation known as the 80/20 syndrome, that is 80% of the women, chasing 20% of the men. The result is women in their prime turning away perfectly eligible young men in the hope of finding their dream male, who really only exists as an ideal, not real.\nI have conducted many tests online, including the creation of female profiles of different ages and levels of beauty and I can confirm that the amount of interest a women receives online makes it almost impossible for the average guy to shine through, and the average woman to fall for the misconception that the world of men is her Oyster…..it IS NOT!\nThere is no doubt that the consequence of this situation has alienated men from the normal realms of interaction with women, and it is invariably the men who are the most down to earth and most suitable candidates to be a decent family man who are the first to give up.",

However, recent statistics have raised questions about the effectiveness of the financial investment made in curbing this phenomenon. Despite a substantial amount of money – nearly 500 million pounds – being allocated to this cause, the latest figures reveal a puzzling trend: France is intercepting fewer Channel migrants compared to the previous year. This trend calls for a closer examination of the situation to determine whether the allocated funds are being utilized efficiently.\nDecline in Intercepted Migrants\nA disconcerting statistic has emerged from the data: only 45.2 percent of migrants have been halted by French beach patrols since the start of the year. This marks a decrease from the 45.8 percent recorded during the same period in the prior year. The implications of this decline are profound, prompting concerns about the effectiveness of the strategies employed by French authorities and the utilization of the allocated funds. This situation has not gone unnoticed by the public or lawmakers, who are demanding answers.\nReactions and Responses\nThe release of these statistics has sparked a range of reactions. Lawmakers, including Members of Parliament (MPs), have expressed their disappointment and concern about the situation. They consider the figures both “disappointing” and “dismal,” underscoring the urgency of the matter. However, it’s not just lawmakers who are taking note; taxpayers, who contribute the funds designated for addressing this issue, are also voicing their concerns. Many are demanding a thorough investigation to ensure that their money is being used effectively and efficiently.\nDigging Deeper: The Value for Money Investigation\nAs taxpayers demand accountability, the call for a “value for money” investigation gains momentum. This investigation seeks to scrutinize the allocation of funds and the strategies implemented to tackle Channel migration. Taxpayers are understandably concerned that the decline in intercepted migrants does not reflect the substantial financial resources that have been dedicated to this cause. The investigation aims to shed light on whether the money is being allocated judiciously and whether the strategies in place are yielding the desired outcomes.\nConclusion\nThe situation surrounding Channel migration remains complex, and recent statistics highlight an alarming trend: despite a significant financial investment, the interception of migrants by French beach patrols has declined. This raises questions about the efficiency of the strategies being used and the allocation of funds. Lawmakers and taxpayers alike are expressing their concerns, demanding accountability and a thorough investigation into the utilization of taxpayer money. As the situation evolves, it is imperative for both the UK and France to collaboratively address the issue, ensuring that resources are effectively employed to achieve the desired goals. Only through transparency, cooperation, and effective strategies can the challenge of Channel migration be adequately managed.",

With tensions rising, is it time to cut ties with this contentious European institution?\nWhat’s the Problem with the ECHR?\nSet up after WWII to protect human rights, the ECHR oversees the European Convention on Human Rights. However, it frequently creates news laws through loose interpretation powers. ECHR judgments can even override Britain’s Supreme Court.\nFor many, this breaches UK sovereignty – an external body shaping British law without democratic accountability. Some argue the ECHR actively obstructs the government’s ability to limit immigration and implement the public’s mandate.\nWould Exiting Restore Control?\nProponents claim leaving the ECHR would diminish rights protections. Sceptics counter that principles established during Britain’s imperial era remain entirely sufficient safeguards.\nIn fact, preventing migrant boats under international law may resolve the crisis without abandoning conventions. It’s once arrivals reach Britain that the ECHR causes issues. Stop them at the source and it becomes irrelevant.\nA Convenient Distraction?\nCynics suggest the ECHR furore actually distracts from Conservative failures to curb runaway immigration rates now at record highs.\nGrand schemes like deporting minuscule numbers to Rwanda dominate headlines precisely to draw attention from broken promises. Such theatrics cannot disguise the reality of an NHS stretched to breaking point and a growing housing emergency.\nWhat About Social Cohesion?\nBeyond straining public services, mass immigration threatens to overwhelm delicate social fabrics. Over one million migrants entered legally last year alone.\nSuccessful multiculturalism relies on gradual assimilation. But is the pace now too swift? Fears abound that isolated communities and divided values could profoundly rupture British society.\nIn Summary\nDebates around the ECHR encapsulate simmering tensions over sovereignty, border control and diversity. Withdrawal may prove little more than symbolic, skirting root deficiencies in immigration strategy. Yet the question remains – should foreign courts dictate British life? For a nation uncertain of its future, the answer grows urgent.\n• The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) oversees human rights across Europe but is seen as overreaching by creating new UK laws\n• Critics argue the ECHR enables uncontrolled immigration policies against the public mandate\n• Proponents warn that exiting the ECHR could reduce UK human rights protections\n• Leaving may not resolve immigration issues as blocking boats could avoid ECHR involvement\n• Some claim the focus on the ECHR distracts from wider government failures to limit immigration\n• Mass immigration is seen as risking social cohesion if migrant integration is too rapid\n• Debating the ECHR symbolises tensions over sovereignty, diversity and border control\n• Withdrawal could prove merely symbolic without addressing strategy deficiencies\n• Fundamental questions remain over foreign courts dictating British society against public interest\nIn summary, while abandoning the controversial ECHR has backers and detractors, it may fail to reconcile the deeper immigration concerns currently testing Britain’s social fabric.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_unraveling-the-complex-puzzle-chinas-looming-threat-of-deflation/content_774.html": "Unraveling the Complex Puzzle – China’s Looming Threat of Deflation\nChina, once expected to emerge robustly from the Covid-19 pandemic, is grappling with an unexpectedly weak rebound, leaving analysts baffled and apprehensive. Recent data revealing negative indicators of Chinese inflation have sounded the alarm, raising concerns about the potential slide into deflation. In the midst of this economic uncertainty, President Joe Biden has even labeled China’s predicament a “ticking time bomb”.\n**Deflation Fears Grow as Key Indicators Turn Negative**\nAs economic indicators take a downward plunge, the world watches as China grapples with the threat of deflation. The July consumer prices index slumped by 0.3% compared to the previous year, while the producer prices index plummeted by a staggering 4.4%. This unsettling development marks the first time both indices have slipped into negative territory since November 2020 when the world economy was paralyzed by the pandemic.\n**Mixed Signals: Signs of Hope Amidst Decline**\nAmidst the prevailing gloom, there are glimmers of hope. The drop in producer prices could potentially mitigate global inflationary pressures. Trivium China, a respected consulting firm, highlights a marginal uptick in consumer prices in July compared to the previous month, suggesting that the decline may be bottoming out. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also saw a slight increase in July. China’s GDP growth of 5.5% in the first half of the year offers a glimpse of optimism, indicating a possible achievement of Beijing’s modest 5% growth target for 2023.\n**From Revenge Spending to Cautious Consumption**\nThe narrative of a roaring comeback post-pandemic is not playing out as expected. An anticipated surge in consumer spending, often termed “revenge spending,” failed to materialize. Despite a substantial increase of 17.8 trillion yuan in household savings during 2022, caution seems to be the prevailing sentiment. The Chinese populace, instead of spending recklessly, appears to be exercising prudence. Although domestic travel during the May Day holiday surged by nearly 20% compared to 2019, the revenue generated barely surpassed pre-pandemic levels.\nAdam Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, expresses his surprise at the lackluster nature of China’s economic rebound, stating, “It’s quite shocking to see just how weak the rebound is in China.”\n**Savings Surge Amidst Lingering Apprehensions**\nIntriguingly, despite repeated interest rate cuts by banks, personal deposits skyrocketed to an all-time high of 133.1 trillion yuan in June. The driving force behind this surge seems to be the lingering apprehensions arising from the unconventional zero-Covid policies pursued during the pandemic. This shift toward more liquid assets is often interpreted as a manifestation of fear and a need for self-insurance.\n**Property Market Woes: A Significant Factor in China’s Economic Conundrum**\nThe core of China’s economic challenges lies in its beleaguered real estate sector. Accounting for nearly 30% of GDP, the industry has faced turmoil due to a governmental crackdown on over-leveraging and restricted access to financing for property developers. Coupled with zero-Covid measures, this led to construction halts and potential homeowners being stranded despite significant down payments. The sector’s confidence has been profoundly shaken, as evidenced by a 7.9% decline in real estate investment during the first half of 2023.\n**Country Garden’s Plunge Highlights Real Estate Struggles**\nCountry Garden, China’s largest property developer, is emblematic of the industry’s troubles. Once valued at $50 billion, it is now on the brink of default, its worth having plummeted to $3.3 billion. This echoes the fate of Evergrande, the second-largest developer, which defaulted in 2021, inducing panic and mortgage boycotts. Country Garden’s commitment to deliver nearly 700,000 units in 2023 is overshadowed by JP Morgan’s forecast of an 80% drop in home sales during the latter half of the year.\n**Structural and Social Factors Exacerbate Woes**\nStructural issues compound China’s economic challenges. The rate of urbanization has slowed, reducing demand for housing in second and third-tier cities. Plummeting marriage and birth rates further dampen the need for larger homes. With youth unemployment reaching an all-time high of 21.3%, many young individuals opt to remain with their parents for extended periods.\n**Beijing’s Dilemma: Stimulus Measures and Fiscal Responsibility**\nAmid these challenges, the question arises: will Beijing resort to stimulus measures? While past crises prompted the government to encourage local borrowing for infrastructure projects, this approach has been criticized for perpetuating fiscal irresponsibility. China’s current leaders emphasize “high quality growth,” focusing on technological advancement and self-sufficiency over blind pursuit of GDP growth.\n**The Road Ahead: Balancing Policy Interventions**\nWhile Beijing has yet to unveil significant fiscal or monetary policy changes, addressing the mounting local government debt is a priority. These authorities, already weighed down by infrastructure overspending and aggravated by zero-Covid measures, teeter on the edge of default. The estimated debt burden of $13 trillion to $23 trillion underscores the complexity of the issue.\nDespite differing viewpoints, experts concur on the need for substantial government intervention. As Houze Song, a researcher of the Chinese economy at MacroPolo, highlights, the absence of a significant stimulus could impact third-quarter growth. While a gradual stabilization is anticipated, instilling confidence remains pivotal to avoid prolonged economic stagnation. China’s economic landscape remains intricate, demanding a cautious orchestration of policy measures to navigate the challenging journey ahead.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_immigration-threatens-to-tear-the-eu-apart/content_757.html": "Immigration threatens to tear the EU apart\nThe Crisis, the Critics, and the Consequences\n**Introduction**\nIn recent years, the European Union (EU) has been grappling with a critical and seemingly unavoidable threat – immigration. This divisive issue, which has raised concerns about sovereignty, cultural identity, and the strain on social systems, is examined in this blog post. We’ll delve into the crisis itself, the critics of EU immigration policies, and the far-reaching consequences that could tear Europe apart.\n**The Crisis Unfolding**\nThe EU, once celebrated for its open borders and commitment to freedom of movement, now faces an internal crisis of its own making. It’s an issue that affects both past and present EU leaders, as well as those in the United Kingdom.\nWhile media narratives may downplay it, the reality is that leaders on both sides have the legal tools to address this situation effectively. The question remains: why haven’t they taken more decisive action?\n**Critics Speak Up**\nWithin the EU, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) stands as a symbol of the EU’s influence. However, some argue that the ECHR operates as a puppet of the EU, leading to its inefficacy. According to critics, this is a prime reason why some nations, like the UK, should have reconsidered their involvement in the ECHR long ago.\nA central issue for critics is the lack of enforcement concerning illegal immigration and the failure to ensure that legal immigrants, such as students, leave the host nation when required. Critics argue that these oversights are part of a broader plan, though this plan is now showing signs of backfiring.\n**The Unintended Consequences**\nAs the EU’s immigration infrastructure strains under the pressure of mass migration, even staunch supporters of open borders like France and Germany have had to make tough choices. They’ve resorted to enforcing their own borders to stem the tide of incoming immigrants.\nIronically, these nations had previously criticized countries like Poland, which had adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards legal immigration since 2015. Now, they find themselves in a position where they are breaking their own quota laws.\nSouthern European countries, such as Spain, have also been significantly affected by immigration, although their experiences often receive less media attention. With multiple migration routes, including the Western Crossing, Central Crossing, and Eastern Crossing, these nations have borne the brunt of the crisis.\n**A Glimpse of the Future: Cyprus**\nTo highlight the gravity of the situation, let’s take a closer look at Cyprus. In just a few short years, Cyprus has experienced a dramatic transformation due to an unprecedented influx of immigrants. This Mediterranean paradise, once a favored holiday destination, now grapples with the highest volume of immigration per capita in the world.\nThe idyllic scenes that once defined Cyprus have been replaced by the harsh realities of a society under pressure. This serves as a stark warning of what might await the rest of Europe and the UK if the immigration issue isn’t addressed promptly.\n**Conclusion**\nIn this turbulent climate, it’s vital that voices are heard. Critics argue that it’s not about civil unrest but about taking a stand for the values, culture, and identity of a nation. It’s about resisting the forces that seek to undermine these foundations.\nThe immigration challenge in Europe extends beyond its borders and threatens to divide the continent. While the topic is undoubtedly complex and emotionally charged, it is essential to have open discussions and explore solutions that are mindful of the interests of both nations and individuals.\nAs Europe grapples with this issue, it remains to be seen whether leaders can find common ground to address the immigration crisis and protect the integrity of the EU. Only time will tell if unity can prevail in the face of this pressing challenge.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_one-in-twelve-londoners-are-illegal-immigrants/content_1033.html": "One in twelve Londoners are illegal immigrants\nOne in Twelve Londoners Potentially Undocumented: Shocking Population Study Reveals Significant Migrant Presence\nA groundbreaking confidential study commissioned by Thames Water has unveiled startling statistics about London’s population, suggesting that approximately one in twelve residents may be residing in the United Kingdom without legal documentation.\nThe meticulously researched report, compiled by researchers at Edge Analytics, presents a comprehensive analysis of the capital’s ‘irregular’ population. Using a sophisticated methodology that combines academic estimates of national illegal migration patterns with National Insurance registration data for non-EU foreign nationals over a nine-year period, the study provides a nuanced breakdown of undocumented residents across London’s boroughs.\nDetailed Findings and Methodology\nThe research yielded a range of estimated figures, with the lowest projection standing at 390,355 undocumented individuals and the highest reaching 585,533. The median estimate sits at 487,944 – a figure that represents a significant proportion of London’s diverse population.\nResearchers hypothesise that the majority of these individuals entered the United Kingdom legally through work, study, or visitor visas, subsequently overstaying their permitted duration. The report aligns with broader national estimates suggesting more than one million illegal migrants are present in the UK, with approximately 60 percent concentrated in the capital.\nPolitical and Administrative Response\nShadow Home Secretary Chris Philp expressed grave concerns about the findings, stating emphatically: “It is totally unacceptable to have these numbers of illegal immigrants in the UK. The legislative framework needs careful examination to prevent spurious human rights, modern slavery, and asylum claims from impeding the removal of individuals without legal status.”\nRichard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK, echoed similar sentiments, highlighting potential economic and infrastructural implications. “One in twelve people in London are here illegally, likely working without proper authorisation and utilising taxpayer-funded public services and infrastructure. This situation is entirely unacceptable and underscores the urgent need for robust border control,” he commented.\nBroader Immigration Context\nThe study emerges against a backdrop of escalating migration challenges. Recent data reveals that over 1,000 migrants have already crossed the English Channel in small boats during the first 21 days of 2025 – the quickest such milestone on record. In the previous year, 36,816 individuals successfully navigated the treacherous shipping strait, marking the deadliest year for small boat migrations.\nThe Home Office has attempted to address these challenges, with a spokesman emphasising their commitment to action: “This Government is actively strengthening global partnerships and systematically dismantling criminal networks profiting from dangerous small boat crossings. We have successfully removed 16,400 illegal migrants in just six months – the highest figure in half a decade – demonstrating our resolute stance that those arriving through illegal channels will be returned.”\nEnforcement Efforts\nRecent enforcement operations have intensified, particularly in London. Between July and November, the Home Office’s Immigration Enforcement team conducted nearly 1,000 visits, resulting in 770 arrests and 462 premises receiving civil penalty notice referrals. Potential fines for employers can reach up to £60,000 per illegal worker.\nMinister for Border Security and Asylum, Dame Angela Eagle MP, emphasised the government’s commitment: “Dismantling criminal networks and restoring order to our asylum system is fundamental to our Plan for Change. We are deliberately increasing arrests and enforcement visits to prevent systemic abuse of our immigration framework.”\nTargeted raids have focused on sectors frequently associated with illegal employment, including car washes, nail bars, supermarkets, and construction sites. These operations aim to address not only immigration violations but also potential labour exploitation and working conditions beneath legal standards.\nUtility Sector Perspective\nThames Water, which commissioned the initial study, maintained a measured response. A company spokesman clarified: “Our analysis of ‘hidden and transient’ populations utilises independent consultants drawing from publicly available sources, including census data, surveys, and published academic research. Thames Water was not involved in drafting the report’s conclusions.”\nBroader Implications\nThe report raises critical questions about infrastructure planning, service provision, and the socio-economic dynamics of London’s rapidly evolving demographic landscape. It underscores the complex challenges faced by policymakers in managing migration, balancing humanitarian considerations with legal and economic imperatives.\nAs the debate continues, this groundbreaking study provides unprecedented insight into the scale and nature of undocumented migration in the United Kingdom’s capital city, promising to fuel ongoing discussions about border control, immigration policy, and social integration.\nSummary\n• A confidential study suggests that approximately one in twelve London residents (between 390,355 and 585,533 people) may be living in the UK without legal documentation.\n• Most undocumented migrants reportedly entered legally on work, study, or visitor visas and then overstayed their permitted duration.\n• The study, commissioned by Thames Water, used National Insurance registrations and academic estimates to calculate the figures.\n• Political figures like Chris Philp and Richard Tice expressed concerns about the potential impact on public services and border control.\n• In 2025, over 1,000 migrants have already crossed the English Channel in small boats within the first 21 days – the quickest such record.\n• The Home Office claims to have removed 16,400 illegal migrants in six months, the highest figure in half a decade.\n• Between July and November, immigration enforcement conducted nearly 1,000 visits in London, resulting in:\n– 770 arrests\n– 462 premises receiving civil penalty notice referrals\n– Potential fines up to £60,000 per illegal worker\n• Enforcement efforts focused on sectors like car washes, nail bars, supermarkets, and construction sites.\n• The report highlights the complex challenges of managing migration, balancing legal, economic, and humanitarian considerations.",

There is a unique tranquility to the whole area, a small church sits just outside the monastery itself, then there is the actual monastery itself. within the grounds there is a wonderful view of the entire valley. There is an enormous statue of Grigoris Afxentiou, who died there in March 1957.\nhttps://youtu.be/UCqRZdU16Vo\nHistory\nMachairas Monastery (Greek: Μαχαιράς) is a historic monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary located about 40 km from the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia. It lies at an altitude of about 900 m and was founded at the end of the 12th century close to the current village of Lazanias.\nLegend has it that an unknown hermit smuggled one of the 70 icons said to have been painted by Luke the Apostle secretly from Asia Minor to Cyprus. This icon of the Virgin Mary remained in its hiding place until the arrival of two other hermits from Palestine in 1145: Neophytos and Ignatius who stumbled across the icon in a cave. To reach it, they had to machete their way into the cave through the thick plant growth, so the icon assumed the name ‘Machairotissa’ in reference to the Greek word for knife μαχαίρι (Makhaira). The whole monastery founded on this site takes its name from this icon.\nGrigoris Afxentiou\nDuring October, 1955, on the day after Field Marshal Harding’s arrival on Cyprus Grigoris Afxentiou raided Lefkoniko Police Station, in broad daylight, and seized the entire armoury that was stored there. Although the raid was planned well in advance it clearly appeared as a challenge to the Field Marshal’s authority who thereafter pursued Afxentiou zealously.\nIn December, 1955, Afxentiou was relocated on orders of General Grivas to the Troodos mountain range and the General’s hideout at Spilia, which led to Afxentiou’s involvement in the Battle of Spilia.\nOn March 3, 1957, after an informant had betrayed his location, the British forces surrounded Afxentiou outside his secret hideout near the Machairas Monastery. At the time, inside the hideout were Afxentiou and four fellow guerrilla fighters. Realising he was outnumbered, Afxentiou ordered his comrades to surrender but stayed behind to fight to the death.\nThe British asked Afxentiou to surrender his arms but he replied “Molon labe” (trans. “come and take them”) quoting King Leonidas of Sparta at Thermopylae. Unable to drive him out and after sustaining casualties, the British forces resorted to pouring petrol into his hideout and lighting it, burning him alive. In fear of a popular uprising, the British buried his scorched body at the Imprisoned Graves, in the yard of the Central Jail of Lefkosia, where he lies today.\nThe cave where Grigoris Afxentiou was burned to death is a few hundred yards away from Machairas Monastery, there are always lots of wreaths and little mementos left by people who still show their respect for this man.\nGetting there\nThe drive to Machairas is not to long, if you are driving from Nicosia, it’s off the road to the Troodos mountains, if you are driving from Larnaca, the easiest route if via Lefkara where it is signposted.",

It helps organisations develop creative, flexible and successful strategies to pressing problems.\nAction Learning Solves Problems\nAction Learning solves problems and develops leaders simultaneously because its simple rules force participants to think critically and work collaboratively. Action Learning is particularly effective for solving complex problems that may appear unsolvable. It elevates the norms, the collaboration, the creativity, and the courage of groups.\nAction Learning assists students in reflecting on the advancement of their group functioning, rather than on their problem solving. In this way, Action Learning participants become effective leaders as they solve difficult problems. Action learning is the process of bringing thinking and action into harmony. Learning is a continuous process and is best achieved with an open, probing mind, an ability to listen, question and explore ideas.\nWhat happens in an action learning set? Through reflection, we gain a deeper understanding of the issues we face. This enables us to manage change more effectively, and meet the challenges we face in the workplace. It’s this ethos that is at the centre of our work. Through working in action learning sets, we bring together diverse peers or people from within the same organisation to work through issues, share ideas and challenge perceptions in a trusting, supportive environment\nBenefits\nEvery situation has its unique issues and challenges so the benefits you glean from action learning are largely defined by what specific matters you bring to the process. You can expect to experience many positive changes including:\n- Acquiring long lasting problem solving skills\n- Promoting leadership skills\n- Being challenged by the team\n- Learning best practice\n- Evolving fresh ideas\n- Forming effective plans for immediate implementation\n- Achieving desired results in a constructive way\nIn my own experience, having completed a Master’s in Professional Development, which was an Action Learning Degree, it dawned on me that, my personal struggle with mainstream education, was not actually my issue, on the contrary, it was the learning style that did not suit my particular learning style.\nEven though the information age has changed the education system beyond recognition, the core structure is still the same, it is STILL about retaining and regurgitating information, which is then tested and quite often the results do not reflect the true abilities of the candidate.\nOn the particular set that I was part of, there were six of us, all at the Master’s level but each of us were in different fields. The methodology that involves interaction, discussion, raising questions and experiential learning was far more effective than reading something from a book or a screen.\nIn the first instance, students and even children, should not be tested and graded according to their results on a particular day, they should firstly be tested to ascertain their particular LEARNING STYLE, something that David Kolb researched a long time ago, along with Honey & Mumford.\nRead New experiments in self-teaching HERE:",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-history-of-immigration-to-the-uk-a-recent-phenomenon/content_678.html": "The History of Immigration to the UK: A Recent Phenomenon\nDebunking the “Nation of Immigrants” Myth\nThe claim that the UK is a ‘nation of immigrants’ is misleading. For nearly a thousand years, there has been relatively little net migration to the UK. The huge scale of non-British immigration in the past two decades (over 500,000 per year, of which about 300,000 per annum have been long-term net arrivals) is unprecedented in our very long history. In 1951, less than 4% of the population of England and Wales were foreign-born. This proportion doubled to 8% by 2001 and nearly doubled again to 15% in 2016. Far from being in our DNA, mass immigration is a very recent phenomenon.\nEarly Immigration: Small-Scale and Temporary\nPrevious episodes of immigration have been on a relatively small scale. In the 17th and 18th centuries, about 50,000 French Huguenots arrived over a 40-50 year period. Jewish refugees fleeing Russia, Eastern Europe, and Germany arrived during the 19th and 20th centuries, around 200,000 over a 50-year period, averaging 4,000 per year.\nThe Turning Point: Labour’s Policy Change in the Late 1990s\nThe turning point was a major change in policy by the Labour government in the late 1990s. In the 13 years they were in office, between 1997 and 2010, net migration to the UK by non-Britons totalled over three million. Since the Conservatives took office in 2010, net migration by non-Britons has totalled 2.7 million. Today, the non-UK born population stands at 9.4 million.\nPre-Roman Britain: Indigenous Inhabitants\nThe history of Britain before the Roman invasion is known as pre-history, as we lack written records. However, archaeological and palaeontological evidence shows that the area now known as Britain has been inhabited for almost one million years by small, transient populations of hunters. Britain may only have been continuously inhabited for the last 12,000 years. About 10,000 years ago, the inhabitants began using the land for agriculture, possibly due to migration.\nPost-Roman Occupation: Contested Migration Scales\nAfter the Roman Occupation ended, Britain’s population fell markedly, perhaps to as little as 1.25 million. In this period, Britain experienced invasions and settlement by Germanic tribes, but their size and scale are contested. Some historians believe the number of Anglo-Saxons was relatively small, while others argue for large-scale migration. Subsequent Viking invasions may have made up 4%-8% of the total population.\nThe Middle Ages and Early Modern Period: Modest Migrations\nThe Middle Ages saw very small migrations, including Jewish people who were later expelled in 1290, and Flemings. England’s rise as a trading power in the sixteenth century arguably marked the start of contemporary migration, but on a small scale. In 1610, it was estimated that only 10,000 of London’s 300,000 people were born abroad.\n18th and 19th Centuries: Small Numbers of Migrants\nOver the next couple of centuries, small numbers of Europeans, Africans, and Asians came to Britain. It is estimated there were about 10,000-20,000 Africans living in Britain in the eighteenth century, with some outlying estimates of 30,000. Jews returned under the Protectorate (1653–1659), with around 6,000 living in England by 1734 and 15,000-20,000 by 1800.\nEarly 20th Century: Modest Increases\nBy the 1901 Census, there were 82,844 Eastern Europeans living in Britain. Small numbers of people came from Asia – perhaps a few hundred at the start of the 20th Century. The 1901 census showed just 387 Chinese nationals. In the eighty years between 1851 and 1931, the population born abroad increased by only about one million.\nPost-World War II: Accelerating Immigration\nAfter the Second World War, the pace of immigration increased considerably. Thousands of Poles who had fought for Britain were offered citizenship in 1947, with 162,339 recorded in the 1951 census. Britain also introduced a guest workers scheme enabling large numbers of other Eastern Europeans to come.\nThe 1948 British Nationality Act and Commonwealth Migration\nThe 1948 British Nationality Act granted subjects of the British Empire the right to live and work in the UK, primarily intended to strengthen ties with the Dominions. From 1962, tighter restrictions were put in place, but Commonwealth migrants continued to come.\nThe Modern Era: Unprecedented Levels of Migration\nIn the late 1990s, the pace and scale of migration increased to an unprecedented level. Between 2001 and 2018, the foreign-born population doubled from 4.6 million to over nine million. This massive upturn was due to deliberate policy changes by the 1997-2010 Labour Government, resulting in 3.6 million net foreign migration during that period.\nContinued High Migration Under the Conservatives\nDespite pledging to reduce net migration, immigration reached record levels under the Conservatives after 2010. While reforming the non-EU system, EU migration continued beyond UK control, with 2.2 million long-term net migrants arriving since 2010.\nThe Future of UK Immigration Policy\nThe UK’s departure from the EU on 31 January 2020 gives the government power to end free movement from the EU. However, the published immigration plan risks significantly increasing work immigration from outside the EU, which should be avoided amid economic shocks and rising unemployment from the Coronavirus lockdown.\nSummary\n• In 1951, less than 4% of the population of England and Wales were foreign-born\n• This increased to 8% by 2001 and 15% by 2016\n• Between 1997-2010 under the Labour government, net migration totaled over 3 million\n• Since 2010 under the Conservatives, net migration has totaled 2.7 million\n• As of 2018/19, the non-UK born population stood at 9.4 million\n• In the 80 years from 1851-1931, the foreign-born population increased by only around 1 million\n• It then increased by less than 2 million in the 40 years from 1951-1991\n• Between 2001-2018, the foreign-born population doubled from 4.6 million to over 9 million\n• Total arrivals in 2022 was 1.2 million\n• Total arrivals in 2023 was 1.4 million",

However he admitted the data was not clear enough to justify action now.\nThe PM has promised to consult parliament on any new legal curbs and it is highly unlikely that MPs could be recalled in time to act before the Christmas break.\nA row erupted yesterday over modelling that had appeared to raise the threat of Christmas being ‘cancelled’ for a second year.\nIn forecasts leaked over the weekend, the Sage expert committee warned that without rapid action daily deaths could hit 6,000 in the worst case – and hospital admissions 10,000. But with huge uncertainty over the severity of Omicron, ministers, MPs and experts rejected the ‘implausible’ predictions.\nTory former leader Iain Duncan Smith referred to SAGE modeller Graham Medley as ‘Graham Meddler’ during an interview BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, although it was not clear if it was a slip of the tongue. Criticising blood-curdling claims of up to 6,000 deaths a day if there are no addition restrictions, Mr Duncan Smith said the government should only make a decision based on a ‘wider range of information on the effect of lockdown’.\n‘We need to understand the effect of lockdown is dramatic across so many areas of people’s lives, which equates to the same as people going into hospital,’ he said. Sir Jeremy, head of the Wellcome Trust, said people could take personal responsibility.\n‘Omicron is spreading unbelievably fast. It is a phenomenal variant transmission,’ he said.\n‘There is great uncertainty about what is it going to lead to in terms of pressure on the health system, people going to hospital, particularly people dying, but also what impact is it going to have on the broader society, staff absences, the ability to have functioning other services, so there is great uncertainty.\n‘My personal view is that I think we can wait at the moment until there are more restrictions formally placed.’\nMr Barclay said there had been a ‘robust discussion’ at Cabinet about how to respond to the Omicron threat.\n“We are looking closely at the data, there is much we still don’t know about the severity of Omicron, how it leads to hospital admissions,’ he said.\n“We are looking particularly at the London data, there is a higher prevalence of Omicron particularly in London.”\nAsked if he had been among members of the Cabinet calling for more data, Mr Barclay said: “I think it is right that the Cabinet has a full and robust discussion.\n“That is what people would expect. It is right that we look at the balance between protecting lives and livelihoods.”\nSeveral ministers – including Mr Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss – made clear they were unwilling to back further restrictions until there was better information on the impact of Omicron.\nMr Sunak is understood to have resisted measures that could cost the economy billions ‘off the back of data that is patchy’. The most vocal supporters of a strong response are believed to have been Communities Secretary Michael Gove and Health Secretary Sajid Javid.\nAfterwards Mr Johnson insisted the Government was monitoring the data ‘hour by hour’ and that the arguments for taking action were ‘very, very finely balanced’.\nBut he stressed there are still ‘uncertainties’ around the severity of the new strain, as well as the rate of hospital admissions associated with it and its impact on vaccines.\nHe added: ‘Unfortunately I must say to people that we will have to reserve the possibility of taking further action to protect the public, to protect public health, to protect our NHS. We are looking at all kinds of things to keep Omicron under control and we will rule nothing out.’\nMinisters were briefed at the virtual Cabinet meeting by chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. Ms Truss apparently demanded ministers were given ‘really thorough data’ before approving curbs, and insisted there must be ‘incontrovertible evidence that we need more restrictions’.\nOther ministers voicing similar concerns included Mr Rees-Mogg, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack.\nA Cabinet source said:\n‘There is more data coming on Wednesday, so that should make hopefully the picture a bit clearer and decisions easier to make.’\nTory former chief whip Mark Harper said that ‘not telling the public what’s going on is unacceptable’ as he said ‘we can do so much better than this’.\nMr Johnson was under pressure from his SAGE experts to roll out extra curbs after they delivered dire warnings about what will happen if the PM fails to act urgently. But other experts today slammed as ‘fictitious’ projections of 6,000 daily Covid deaths and 10,000 hospitalisations this winter in a worst-case scenario. Coronavirus cases have also been around the 90,000 mark for four days now, after experts predicted they would double every two days.\nIt has also emerged that ministers are considering slashing isolation for those with Covid from 10 days to seven days due to fears Omicron will cripple the economy. According to Government modelling, up to 2million people could be catching the ultra-transmissible variant per day during the peak this winter. There are growing fears it could push the country into a de facto lockdown with so many isolating with mild illness, even if hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.\nSources say the change in policy is ‘being looked at’ and Health Secretary Sajid Javid is thought to be eager to shorten the isolation timeframe as hospitals and businesses struggle due to absent workers. The lack of a final decision by Mr Johnson on extra curbs means it now seems unlikely that further restrictions will be rolled out before Christmas but there are mounting fears of a crackdown immediately after December 25.\nThe PM has promised that MPs will get a vote on any additional rules but Parliament is now in recess and recalling the House of Commons, holding a debate and then voting would take an estimated 48 hours. Announcing curbs any later than today would therefore run the risk of people being told to follow new rules after they have already travelled to see family for Christmas.\nThe Times reported that Mr Johnson and the Cabinet delayed a decision because they were not yet convinced the latest Omicron data justified announcing new restrictions. However, the newspaper said the Government could opt to impose a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown in England after Christmas, potentially starting on December 28.\nIt was reported on Saturday that Whitehall officials had drawn up regulations which would effectively re-impose ‘Step 2’ of the PM’s lockdown exit roadmap for two weeks. That would mean a ban on indoor socialising and a return of the rule of six for outdoor gatherings. Bars, pubs and restaurants would be banned from serving people indoors.\nThe delay in Mr Johnson’s decision on extra curbs prompted a split within the Cabinet, with Sajid Javid warning ministers that no decision was a decision in itself. The Health Secretary asked experts to ‘kick the tyres’ of government modelling but they were unable to reassure him that the variant is less severe, reports the Times. But Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted that the public should be trusted to make their own decisions as to how best to protect themselves and the family, rather than imposing more restrictions. He also criticised SAGE modelling while saying that there was not enough evidence to suggests new Covid measures were necessary.\nThe Prime Minister convened the meeting of his top team as he faced a growing Cabinet revolt over potential further Covid rules. The PM had been presented with three options to tackle the variant amid surging case numbers, with the lowest level of intervention consisting of advice to limit household mixing indoors, according to The Telegraph.\nThe second level would see mandatory restrictions on household mixing, the return of social distancing and an 8pm curfew for pubs and restaurants while the third and toughest level would see a return to something close to a full lockdown. Mr Johnson is now considering his next move, knowing that any decision to tighten Covid rules will spark a furious Tory backlash.\nDowning Street at lunchtime refused to be drawn on the proposals which are reportedly under consideration, with the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman telling reporters: ‘At this point we are still monitoring the data and keeping a very close eye on it… we would update if any decisions are taken.’\nCOMMENT:\nWhatever our position on the Pandemic, one thing is for certain, we cannot continue to close the economy down, a large number of businesses in the UK are on the brink and the current ‘lockdown by stealth’ that is the result of worst case scenarios being presented by SAGE has resulted in the hospitality industry almost closing it’s doors this Christmas.\nCan the Government continue to pay people to sit at home? What about all those people who are not entitled to any help? What about all those businesses that fall through the cracks and are now finding themselves slowly heading towards bankruptcy?\nThere are some very difficult decisions to be made, but that is what a prime minister is elected to do, his job is to take on board all the evidence and make informed, sensible and prudent decisions and to then explain those decisions to the nation, not by enforcing laws based on vague excuses, but by winning the support of the nation, by earning their respect.\nIt has not helped that there has been so many allegations that the prime minister has not observed his own rules, if this is not true, we need a clear and comprehensive explanation, but if it is true, he must go. This is no time for the country to be led by a leader who does not have the faith and trust of the people.

During the British period, the population of the village increased considerably, from 181 in 1891 to 747 in 1960.\nDisplacement:\nAll of the village’s inhabitants were displaced in 1974, as they fled from the advancing Turkish army to the southern part of the island. Currently, like the rest of the displaced Greek Cypriots, the Greek Cypriots of Makrasyka are scattered throughout the island’s south, with small pockets in the Larnaca district. The number of the Makrasyka Greek Cypriots who were displaced in 1974 was around 950 (920 in 1973 census).\nCurrent Inhabitants:\nToday the village is mainly inhabited by displaced Turkish Cypriots from villages in the Paphos district, such as Asprogia(296), Melandra(325), Anadiou(290), Mamountali(321) Kidasi(310), as well as from Avdimou(260) village in Limassol. In addition, some Turkish nationals from Adıyaman and Adana provinces in Turkey settled in the village in 1975-76. The 2006 Turkish Cypriot census puts the village’s total population at 432.",

Millennials, those born from the 1980s to early 1990s, are also far less likely to chat to neighbours or join in group activities than previous generations.\nThe proportion of under-35s who say they have one or no close friends has tripled from 7 per cent to 21 per cent over the past decade. And only 40 per cent said they had at least four close friends in 2021, down from 64 per cent in 2011/12.\nWhat has happened?\nOver the last decade or so, younger people have increasingly began living virtual lives, in a virtual world with virtual friends, but what has caused this?\nOn the 1st of July 2007, smoking was banned indoors in all public places, a wise move you may think, let’s all be healthy, if cigarettes don’t kill us, then we will live to be 100+ or will we.\nI find the notion of the ‘health freaks’ quite amusing, with their health drinks, their masks and their condescendingly screwed up faces at the prospect of any encounter with anything that may pollute their temple of a body. I have this vision of them laying in a hospital bed in a few decades with a confused look upon their face, when they find that they are dying from absolutely NOTHING!\nThis may be a flippant attitude, but there comes a time when we must be a little more pragmatic about the cycle of life, it is our mortality that makes life so special. If we all knew that we would live to be 200, life would be so grim, that we would be literally begging to meet our end. Perhaps the notion of ever extending mortality is becoming our downfall, as a society, we are becoming so focussed on the duration of our lives, that we are completely forgetting the quality of our lives, which is far more important.\nNow back to the Pubs, I consider the 1st of July 2007 to be the beginning of a new social structure, a new society that has capitulated to the will of the political classes, who have completely dominated every aspect of our lives, in most cases with our consent and willing participation. what happened when this law was brought in to practice? The volume of people visiting pubs fell dramatically, people increasingly began to tire of going to a pub and sitting at a table alone, while their friends went out for a smoke.\nThe next course of action was that people began to buy booze and drink at home, where they could drink and smoke with no rules and not closing time, but as time passed, this increasingly evolved from buying booze and drinking with friends, to buying booze and drinking alone, but how did that happen.\n2007 was another milestone, as Facebook was first thrown open to the public on the 26th September 2006, but it was in 2007 that Facebook really began to take hold of the masses. Such a strange coincidence, that life based around pubs, where people could talk to each other, face-to-face, was made untenable just as the most successful social media platform in the world was about to take a stranglehold, where people increasingly begun to speak to each other online instead, where Facebook could monitor every single word they say.\nFacebook was rapidly followed by Instagram and many other platforms, once again, we began to the witness the evolution of the pseudo-lives, were people were going to extraordinary lengths to present their wonderful and larger than life virtual-lives to the world. As time went by, society increasing began to compare itself to these illusions, making people feel that they were not really happy, not successful, not achieving and somehow missing out.\nAdd to this the fact that this was in parallel to a massive woke movement that has seen society withdraw for fear of offending. Next time you are out, scan the room and take notice that people do not approach each other any more, the art of socialising is dying and with it our entire social structure.\nTake a look at most under 25s, they struggle to look you in the eye when you speak to them, they cannot immerse in conversation, but rather confine themselves to a series of remarks, as thought they are text-messaging with their mouths. As Facebook goes to greater and greater lengths to manipulate us, it is polarising us and nurturing what I call ‘The Messianic Syndrome’ where Facebook increasingly presents us with content that fits in with our opinions, further re-enforcing them, making us totally convinced that our opinion is right and anyone who dare to disagree is an idiot.\nThe cycle of withdrawal and isolation was already accelerating, then along came the Pandemic. Oh my, what a wonderful opportunity to manipulate the population en-mass! A team of ‘Brain-Surgeons’ were put in charge of terrifying us with predictions of Armageddon, Facebook was exercising control of the narrative, by blocking any contradictory arguments to the official line, but it appears that they went to far and they are now desperately trying to reverse the damage, but so far, they have been unsuccessful.\nWe now have an entire generation who is not conforming, they may have achieved their goal of ‘monitored interaction’ but society is paying a heavy price as they have lost the will to achieve, they have lost the will to work, to socialise and to have children. fortunately the Government is taking steps to maintain our population, by permitting boat-loads of immigrants to arrive, in an effort to reverse the decline in births and keep the UK well stocked with fertile young men, although I’m not sure how that will go.\nThe greatest tragedy of all, is that we are inherently social creatures, there is a difference between wanting space, solitude or just the lack of any distractions and the complete inability to socialise. I am happy to spend days without seeing a soul, immersed in my work and my writing, but when I choose to socialise, I am able to. That is completely different to the total lack of social skills, exacerbated by the pandemic, social media and the woke culture, which has struck fear in to the young, discouraging them from engaging in conversation with strangers. The difference being, that one is a ‘Grumpy Old Git’ and the other is little more than an ‘Isolated, Insecure, socially inept’ catastrophe.\nIs this an exaggeration?\nWhat would you think if someone were to walk around your town centre saying ‘Hello’ to everyone? At some point, someone would make a complaint, guaranteed!\nIt was not long a go, when young men would think of any number of ridiculous corny remarks, just to approach a young lady and speak to her, but not any more. Not only do young men lack the courage, confidence and motivation to do so, but even if they were to do so, young women would not know how to respond, my guess is that they would simply say: “Add me on Facebook and message me!”\nThat would work for her, because she could withdraw to the virtual world, where she can aspire to the illusions on social-media, whilst little more than ‘settling’ for any real-world suiters, and in the meantime, the young men can do likewise, while they are watching porn.\nComment\nI feel that this phenomenon is a sad reality of modern humanity. Pubs were the heart of our civilisation, they were fundamental to our way of life and they have been destroyed with ‘malice aforethought’ in a greater effort to control the masses, the political classes may be destroying them. In addition to the smoking, which is of course another matter, there has been the never-ending onslaught of higher and higher overheads on pubs, which in turn is paid for by the consumer.\nThe traditional pubs are dying, being replaced with cold, corporate, over-priced bars, that have no soul, no community spirit and where people go to present a fake version of themselves, to people who do not care. Personally, I loved my local pub, it was real people, a real community with hardly a full set of teeth between the lot of them, but I would take that over the glitzy, fake establishments that are only concerned with taking as much as possible from those daft enough to pay it, any day, but sadly, it has also closed,\nPubs should have been protected establishments, but once they began to be treated like ‘Cash-Cows’ the outcome was inevitable. We have been ‘price-desensitised’ in order for us to think nothing of paying £5, £10 or £15 for a drink, how can they survive? Think about it for a minute, some people can feed themselves for a week for the cost of two of three drinks, not everyone earns enough to take these ridiculous prices in their stride. So people begun drinking at home, speaking to their friends online, living virtual lives and gradually, they have forgotten how to live.\nWe owe it to ourselves and to society as a whole, to fight back against this cultural home-imprisonment, that has been enforced on us by stealth.",

The Northampton Business Improvement District (BID) recently revealed that reports of criminal damage have plummeted by an impressive 40%, while violent incidents have seen a remarkable decline of 60%. These encouraging statistics coincide with an overall 5% reduction in nighttime crime over the past year. In this blog post, we delve into the details of this transformation and the initiatives that have contributed to this positive change.\nA Safer Town Centre\nMark Mullen, the BID Operations Manager, expressed his delight over the remarkable improvement in safety, stating, “It’s wonderful to see our town centre has become even safer.” The BID’s data relies on reports submitted to Northamptonshire Police, underscoring the credibility of these impressive reductions in criminal activity.\nContributing Factors\nA multitude of initiatives has played a crucial role in driving these positive changes in Northampton’s town centre. Among them are:\n1. Nightsafe Operation: This police initiative has bolstered safety measures during nighttime hours, contributing to the reduction in criminal damage.\n2. Operation Kayak: Focused on tackling predatory behavior, this operation has played a pivotal role in curbing violent incidents in the town centre.\n3. Street Pastors and Northampton Guardians: These volunteer-led patrols have been instrumental in providing support and maintaining a visible presence in the community, deterring potential criminal activities.\n4. The Knife Angel: The striking statue, made from over 100,000 knives seized by the police, served as a powerful symbol against violence and played a role in raising awareness.\nPurple Flag Month\nThese remarkable crime figures have been shared during Purple Flag Month, a time dedicated to celebrating cities and towns that have achieved Purple Flag status. Northampton has held this status since 2018. The Purple Flag scheme is designed to highlight places that offer a safe, welcoming environment, and a diverse mix of dining and entertainment options in the evenings. Northampton’s continued recognition under this scheme is a testament to its commitment to providing a secure and vibrant nighttime experience.\nPositive Outlook\nMark Mullen further emphasized the significance of Northampton’s accomplishments, stating, “Achieving this accreditation is no easy feat, and it’s heartening to see that the multitude of proactive projects that are running in the town centre to keep people safe are having a positive impact on the area’s crime figures. Northampton’s nightlife has so much to offer, and it’s wonderful to see our town centre has become even safer for everyone over the past year.”\nOngoing Challenges\nWhile the town has made significant progress in improving safety, it is essential to acknowledge that challenges persist. Over 100 offenses were reported to the police between April and July through the town’s anti-social behavior reporting scheme. Moreover, concerns about crime and antisocial behavior have prompted a recent consultation exercise regarding plans to close Emporium Way, a walkway in Northampton.\nConclusion\nNorthampton’s town centre has undergone a remarkable transformation, with substantial reductions in nighttime crime rates. The dedication of the community, law enforcement, and various initiatives has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in making the town safer for its residents and visitors alike. While there are still challenges to overcome, Northampton’s commitment to maintaining its Purple Flag status and ensuring a vibrant, secure nightlife remains unwavering. This success story serves as an inspiration for communities striving to create safer and more inviting urban environments.",

This transformative piece of legislation, officially known as the 1882 CHAPTER 75, was a pivotal step towards recognizing and securing the property rights of married women in the United Kingdom. This blog post delves into the key provisions and implications of this landmark Act.\n**Introduction: A Historical Context**\nIn the 19th century, societal norms placed severe restrictions on the rights and autonomy of married women. These limitations were most palpable in matters of property ownership and financial control. Traditionally, once a woman married, her legal identity merged with that of her husband, rendering her virtually powerless over her property and assets. However, the Married Women’s Property Act of 1882 emerged as a beacon of change, offering married women newfound agency and independence in their financial affairs.\n**Enactment and Scope of the Act**\nThe Act was signed into law by Queen Victoria, following the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, assembled in the Parliament. Its primary purpose was to consolidate and amend the existing Acts concerning the property rights of married women. The Act introduced several groundbreaking provisions that aimed to empower married women by enabling them to acquire, own, and dispose of property as separate individuals.\n**Key Provisions and Implications**\n1. **Property Ownership and Disposal**: One of the cornerstones of the Act was its provision allowing married women to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property as separate individuals. This transformative change meant that women could own and manage property without the intervention of trustees, fundamentally altering the traditional power dynamics in marital relationships.\n2. **Contractual Capacity**: The Act granted married women the capacity to enter into contracts and incur liabilities related to their separate property. This provision allowed women to engage in trade, pursue occupations, and conduct business independently, essentially treating them as “feme sole” (unmarried women) in legal matters.\n3. **Ante-nuptial Liabilities**: The Act addressed the issue of a woman’s liability for debts and contracts incurred before marriage. It established that a woman’s separate property would be primarily liable for such liabilities. This provision aimed to prevent creditors from targeting a husband’s assets for his wife’s pre-marital debts.\n4. **Policy of Assurance**: The Act enabled married women to effect life insurance policies on their own lives or the lives of their husbands for their separate use. This provision ensured that the benefits of such policies would be protected from creditors and debts of the insured party.\n5. **Maintenance Obligations**: The Act established that a married woman’s separate property could be used to maintain her husband or children. This provision acknowledged that the financial responsibilities in a marriage were not solely the husband’s burden and enabled women to fulfill these obligations from their separate property.\n6. **Legal Proceedings**: The Act granted married women the ability to sue or be sued in their own name, even against their husbands. This provision extended to both civil and criminal proceedings, providing women with legal recourse to protect their separate property and rights.\n**Legacy and Beyond**\nThe Married Women’s Property Act of 1882 was a monumental step towards gender equality in the legal landscape. By recognizing the distinct property rights of married women, the Act challenged long-standing patriarchal norms and established the precedent for future legal reforms aimed at women’s empowerment. The Act’s influence resonated far beyond its time, laying the foundation for subsequent legislation that continued to expand women’s rights in various spheres.\nIn retrospect, the Married Women’s Property Act of 1882 stands as a testament to the power of legislative change in promoting social progress. By giving women the legal tools to assert their financial autonomy, this Act marked a significant stride towards dismantling gender-based inequalities and fostering a more equitable society.\nRead the full text of the Act HERE\nThis is a beautiful post, I was not even aware of this significant act, which is actually shameful, considering that the media is so busy distracting us with ‘perceived issues’ rather than issues that really matter.\nThank you so much for posting.\nThis is a beautiful post, I was not even aware of this significant act, which is actually shameful, considering that the media is so busy distracting us with ‘perceived issues’ rather than issues that really matter.\nThank you so much for posting.",

It is not really far from the sea, yet, it is located high enough for the moist air coming in from the sea to get dry by the time it reaches the village. Therefore, Lefkara becomes an excellent destination during summer time because of the relatively low humidity from May to October and also the mild temperatures in the region.\nToday, the population of the village, which in the post-second-world period exceeded 2500 inhabitants, is not more than 1000 inhabitants amongst whom there are many expacts, because of emigration and rural-urban migration. A significant number of locals have been living in New York, London, South Africa and even Australia. The name of Lefkara village derives from the colour of the surrounding calcareous rocks: “White rocks = Lefkara”. Considering the archaeological findings, the Lefkara region has most probably been inhabited for centuries. Though there is not any relevant evidence, the settlement is likely to have progressively been established and has developed reaching its current status during the Arab raids between the 7th and 9th century A.D.\nThe inhabitants of the island were forced by the situation due to the raids to move from the coastal areas where they were living in this period to the inland ones, looking for safer places to settle. However, the very first written historical statement about Lefkara is brought out in Cypriot big type letters: Saint Neophytos the Recluse, who was born in Lefkara in 1134, according to the information provided by him.\nDuring the occupation period by the Franks, Lefkara became the see of the Greek Orthodox Bishop of Limassol, Amathus and Curium and was one of the four Orthodox Bishops’ sees. This occurred following a papal decision according to which the Cyprus Church administration should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Latin Archbishop resulting to the Greek Orthodox Bishops being forced to abandon their sees in the cities and settle in the rural areas.\nLater Lefkara during the occupation period by the Venetians (1489 – 1570 A.D.) is referred to as a summer resort for the Venetian nobles and their families. According to some researchers, the Lefkara needlecraft known as “lefkaritiko” goes back to this period and the nobles’ wives influenced to some extent the technique used by the Lefkara women. Furthermore, it is said that Leonardo da Vinci, the big Renaissance artist visited Cyprus in the late 16th century as a guest of Catherine Cornaro – Queen of Cyprus. He then visited Lefkara and bought a big tablecloth embroidered on all sides, which was donated to the Milan Cathedral.\nIn 1570 the Turks conquered Cyprus and according to historical sources of the western world, Lefkara made its submission to the Turks and obtained some prerogatives. Yet according to more recent data contained in the folk poem “The Lament of Cyprus” a totally different version is provided, giving evidence of the large village where civilians arrived to save themselves, ending up in being the first victim of the Ottoman incursions.\nTherefore, the village was ransacked and its population was massacred. A further significant event likely to have occurred during that period is the small surrounding settlements being abandoned for safety reasons and the fact that their population moved to the main Lefkara settlement. Some years later, the British colonization occurred in 1878 and namely in 1883 Lefkara and Morphou were declared the first rural municipalities in Cyprus. A Town Hall becoming operational there has been a determining fact for the further development of this large village, contributing drastically in its progress and its inhabitants’ welfare. Then a number of regulations were enacted, setting in order so many things in the large village.\nAn abattoir, a municipal market with a distinct butcher’s shop and a pig meat shop were established. Street lamps were installed to enhance local electrification. A group of experts in street lamps lighting and road sweepers were appointed. The problem of water scarcity is dealt with, whereas in 1934 an electric generator was installed in Lefkara to supply all houses with electricity resulting from an agreement co-signed by the Municipality and a private company. In 1938 a telephone line connecting Lefkara with Larnaca was installed.",

The choice was whether to remain a part of what was then called the Common Market or to make a daring exit. The story of the referendum campaign was nothing short of a tragicomic tale, featuring an unlikely alliance of bedfellows. Today, as history repeats itself in a new referendum, let’s journey back to those times and draw parallels to the present day.\n**Tiptoeing into a Brothel: A Bold Move**\nEmbarking on a decision as significant as a referendum felt like tiptoeing into the unknown, much like entering a brothel. The sense of daring, uncertainty, and the potential for pleasure or pain created an atmosphere of tension and curiosity. During that era, I produced several films documenting the referendum, each echoing themes that resonate even today. Looking back, it’s fascinating to see how perspectives have shifted while some stark differences remain.\n**The Labour Cabinet’s Dilemma**\nAt the heart of the campaign was the Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, seeking to keep his party united in the face of growing Euroscepticism. His strategy was to promise renegotiations followed by a referendum, an audacious move that allowed his ministers to openly campaign against each other. The Labour cabinet, divided into pro-market centrists led by Roy Jenkins and Eurosceptic left-wingers led by Barbara Castle and Tony Benn, exemplified the complex dynamics at play.\n**Behind Closed Doors: Secret Strategies**\nWhile public debates raged, the behind-the-scenes actions were equally intriguing. Secret meetings convened at the exclusive Dorchester Hotel, where politicians from rival camps discreetly gathered. This eclectic mix of individuals, who would never have shared a public space, engaged in confidential discussions that shaped the course of the campaign. The veil of secrecy added allure to the process, much like the exclusive rooms and soft biscuits that adorned these gatherings.\n**The Yes and No Campaigns: A Clash of Narratives**\nThe campaign to remain within the Common Market, led by figures like Roy Jenkins, embodied the narrative that staying was not just sensible but vital for stability and peace in Europe. On the other side, the no campaign, spearheaded by Tony Benn, Barbara Castle, and other anti-market forces, positioned leaving as an act of sovereignty, challenging the very fabric of British identity. The media’s portrayal of Benn as a bogeyman and the diverse mix of anti-market leaders worked to the advantage of the pro-European strategy.\n**Media Influence and Political Motivations**\nMedia played a significant role in shaping public opinion, with the vast majority of newspapers endorsing the stay campaign. The media’s stance fueled a perception that those advocating for exit were unreliable or even dangerous, thus reinforcing the narrative that staying was the only logical choice. The clash between Benn’s anti-market stance and Margaret Thatcher’s strong pro-European stance also highlighted their personal ambitions and motivations within the campaign.\n**The Power of Numbers and Claims**\nTony Benn’s claim of half a million job losses and skyrocketing food prices due to Common Market membership demonstrated the power of bold statements. This technique of doubling down on claims when challenged showed the extent to which numbers and assertions could influence public perception. However, such tactics also painted Benn as an unreliable source, as critics argued that his economic predictions lacked credibility.\n**The Outcome and Aftermath**\nWhen the votes were counted, the outcome revealed a resounding victory for the “yes” camp, with a two-to-one margin in favor of remaining in the Common Market. This result marked a near-triumph for Roy Jenkins and his like-minded allies, setting the stage for future political developments, including the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).\n**A Deja Vu in Today’s Referendum**\nFast-forward four decades, and history appears to be repeating itself. As the nation faces another pivotal referendum, the echoes of the past are striking. A fresh wave of Euroscepticism and a new campaign have emerged, mirroring some of the debates and divisions of the past. The resurgence of arguments over sovereignty, economic impact, and national identity feels like a déjà vu moment, transporting us back to the intricate web of narratives and motivations that characterized the first referendum.\n**Conclusion**\nThe referendum of 40 years ago remains a defining moment in the UK’s history, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of decision-making, the power of media, and the complexities of political motivations. As we witness a new chapter unfold, the parallels between then and now serve as a reminder that history not only shapes the present but also has a remarkable way of repeating itself, bringing both nostalgia and lessons for the future.\nA fact that I have found very interesting in my research in to the course of events in 1975, were as follows:\n- Nearly all the newspapers, with the exception of two or three obscure publications, were in favour of remaining in the Common Market\n- The Labour administration at the time, led by Harold Wilson, were strongly in favour of remaining.\n- Margaret Thatcher, who had recently been elected as leader of the Conservatives, was PASSIONATELY in favour of the remaining.\n- It is on the record, that Margaret Thatcher, later admitted hiding the agenda for ‘ever closer union’ from the public, because ‘they were not ready for that yet’\n- Tony Benn (Labour) was passionately against remaining and his position, and that of all ‘leavers’ was labelled ‘Marxist’\n- Alistair McAlpine, who’s family owned the Dorchester, was very influential within the yes campaign, is on the record, stating that there was massive contribution from the banks. He had even arranged a secret meeting at the Dorchester, in order to form a ‘strategy of influence’\nWhichever side of the fence you may be, it seems that one fact is certain, the question of Europe has been and remains, one of the most toxic issues in British politics. it matters not what people support, provided that they are freely permitted to express their opinion and more importantly, that we all respect the fundamental basis of Democracy and welcome different points of view and then respect a fair ballot.\nHowever, the media and those who influence them behind the scenes, have successfully impregnated the British electorate with so much hate and anger, that any vote, any opinion and any position will invariably be the cause for hostility.\nSadly, I see no solution to this. Even now, I am seeing the following narrative in the media quite frequently:\n“Most of those who voted to leave in 2016 are now dead, so we have been taken out of the EU by dead people”\nI am not certain how I should react to this position, but in response, I would say, that many of the people who voted to remain in 1975, were the very same people who began to support leaving by the mid 1980s, what do we say about them?\nWhen manipulation of the masses by the media, the government and those in a position of power, reaches the levels that it has in this debate, society as a whole suffers and whatever happens in the future, this issue is sadly tearing our country apart.\n“It is on the record, that Margaret Thatcher, later admitted hiding the agenda for ‘ever closer union’ from the public, because ‘they were not ready for that yet’\nEver Closer Union was referred to in the government leaflet breaking down the agreement in 1971.\n‘ever closer union’ is about removing economic barriers to bring people closer together.

The controversy surrounds her admission of leaking private information about Nigel Farage to the BBC, resulting in her resignation. With the bank yet to confirm her status as a “good leaver” or disclose any exit package, questions are being raised about her future compensation. In this blog post, we delve into the unfolding events, political reactions, and the impact on NatWest’s reputation.\nThe Farage Row and Dame Alison’s Resignation:\nThe storm began when Dame Alison Rose acknowledged being the source behind a BBC report that disclosed the closure of Nigel Farage’s Coutts account, owned by NatWest. The bank cited his views as not aligning with their values, leading to the closure, but the revelation of confidential client information raised eyebrows and sparked intense public scrutiny.\nCalls for No Severance Pay:\nSenior Conservative MPs are adamant that Dame Alison Rose should not receive any severance pay in light of the circumstances surrounding her resignation. While acknowledging her entitlement to her pension, influential figures such as Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Iain Duncan Smith assert that she must not be rewarded for her departure from the bank.\nSir Jacob Rees-Mogg criticised Dame Alison for focusing on “woke initiatives” rather than the core banking business, and he expressed surprise that the bank’s board didn’t act promptly on such a fundamental banking principle. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, while glad to see her leave, suggested that NatWest has every right to question whether she should receive a full severance package.\nThe Barclays Precedent:\nDrawing attention to a similar case, when Jes Staley, the former CEO of Barclays, left the bank due to ties with Jeffrey Epstein, he received a substantial payout. However, Barclays promptly disclosed the details of his exit package, unlike NatWest’s handling of the current situation.\nNatWest’s Reputation at Stake:\nCritics argue that NatWest’s handling of the situation has been lax and that the bank’s reputation has suffered significantly as a result. Senior Tory backbencher David Jones urged the board to thoroughly reconsider whether Dame Alison deserved any compensation and also questioned the effectiveness of the board in challenging executive directors.\nCalls for Accountability Extend to Coutts CEO:\nNigel Farage’s accusations against Peter Flavel, CEO of Coutts, have amplified the issue. Mr Farage claims that Flavel ignored his letters about the account closure, leading to calls for Flavel’s resignation. The controversy has further undermined confidence in the bank and its management.\nConclusion:\n– Scandal hits NatWest as former Chief Executive, Dame Alison Rose, admits leaking private information about Nigel Farage to the BBC.\n– NatWest declines to confirm if Dame Alison will receive severance pay or be classified as a “good leaver.”\n– Senior Conservative MPs demand Dame Alison should not receive severance pay due to the circumstances of her resignation.\n– Last year, Dame Alison received a total pay packet of £5.25 million, sparking further controversy.\n– Comparisons drawn with Barclays’ prompt disclosure of CEO Jes Staley’s exit pay in a similar case.\n– Critics argue NatWest’s lax handling of the situation has damaged its reputation significantly.\n– Calls for accountability extend to Coutts CEO, Peter Flavel, after Nigel Farage accuses him of ignoring letters about account closure.\n– NatWest faces a crucial moment in rebuilding trust and addressing the controversy.\nThe scandal surrounding Dame Alison Rose’s departure has thrust NatWest into the spotlight, with politicians and the public demanding accountability and transparency. The absence of clarity regarding her severance pay has fuelled criticism, and the bank’s reputation has taken a significant hit. As the controversy unfolds, NatWest faces a crucial moment in deciding how to address the situation and regain the trust of its customers and stakeholders. The coming months will undoubtedly be critical in shaping the bank’s future direction and restoring confidence in its leadership.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_farage-challenges-streeting-over-grooming-gangs/content_233.html": "Farage Challenges Streeting Over Grooming Gangs\nGrooming Gangs Commentary as Political Tensions Escalate\nIn a significant escalation of the ongoing debate surrounding grooming gangs, Nigel Farage has directly challenged Health Secretary Wes Streeting’s position, accusing him of attempting to obscure the truth about organised child exploitation in Britain.\nThe confrontation emerged after Mr Streeting, in a detailed interview with The Guardian, expressed grave concerns that “irresponsible and coarse public discourse” surrounding the issue could potentially trigger further violence against Muslim communities. The Health Secretary drew particular attention to the risk of incidents similar to the tragic New Zealand mosque attacks.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Telegraph on Saturday, Mr Farage delivered a forceful rebuttal, characterising Streeting’s comments as “insulting” and suggesting they represented an attempt to impede the pursuit of truth in this sensitive matter. The Reform party leader expanded on his position, expressing particular concern about victim representation: “I am horrified that later on, on that [Guardian] front page, he says that it’s time we heard the voices of the victims. Yes, that’s what we want, an inquiry, because they’ve not had a voice.”\nThe controversy has intensified in recent weeks following Labour’s decision to oppose a national inquiry into the scandal, a proposal that had garnered support from both Kemi Badenoch and prominent tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. This decision has drawn particular scrutiny to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who served as head of the Crown Prosecution Service during the height of the Oldham scandal in Greater Manchester.\nIn his extensive Guardian interview, Mr Streeting elaborated on the complexities of the situation: “Victims’ voices have been completely marginalised, and I think that’s a disgrace.” He proceeded to draw a direct connection to international events, referencing the Christchurch tragedy: “If Kemi Badenoch is in any doubt whatsoever about where irresponsible and coarse public discourse can lead on this issue, look on the other side of the world, in Christchurch, New Zealand, where someone walked into a mosque and killed innocent Muslims stone cold dead with a gun whose magazine had inscribed on it ‘for Rotherham’.”\nThe Health Secretary, who previously co-chaired the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on British Muslims, stressed the importance of balanced discourse: “We have to be extremely clear about the failings, the nature of it, and not allow political correctness, fear of stating the truth as it is to fail victims, as has happened before. We must also make sure that entire communities are not tarred with the same brush.”\nStreeting’s constituency context adds another layer of complexity to his position. As MP for Ilford North, where Muslims constitute the largest religious group—comprising nearly a third (32.5 per cent) of the population according to the most recent census—he faces particular pressures. His narrow victory margin of just 528 votes over an independent candidate running on a pro-Gaza platform in the last election underscores these sensitivities.\nThe Labour Party’s stance has drawn criticism from Conservative quarters, who argue that their adopted definition of Islamophobia effectively prevents open discussion of grooming gangs. Ms Badenoch has explicitly called for the Prime Minister to rescind his party’s adoption of this definition.\nRecent police data has brought new urgency to the debate. The first comprehensive analysis of its kind revealed that grooming gangs were responsible for almost two child sexual abuse offences daily reported to police. Statistics gathered from all 43 forces across England and Wales documented 717 child sexual exploitation “grooming” crimes in 2023, with an additional 572 cases recorded in the first nine months of 2024.\nThese figures emerged through the pioneering “Hydrant Programme,” established by police following Alexis Jay’s independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. The programme was specifically created to address what Jay’s report identified as a “widespread failure” to collect “good quality” data on perpetrators, victims, and offences.\nThe data collection initiative represents the first national police scheme to systematically gather and analyse information on “group-based” child sexual abuse, including crucial demographic information such as the ethnic background of perpetrators. This development marks a significant step forward in understanding and addressing the scope and nature of these crimes, though it has also intensified the already heated political debate surrounding the issue.\nSummary\nKey Developments:\n* A significant clash has emerged between Nigel Farage and Health Secretary Wes Streeting over the public discourse surrounding grooming gangs, with Farage accusing Streeting of attempting to suppress the truth.\n* Streeting’s Major Concerns:\n* Warned that inflammatory rhetoric could lead to violence against Muslim communities\n* Drew parallels with the New Zealand mosque attacks\n* Emphasised the need to balance addressing criminal behaviour while avoiding community stigmatisation\n* Recent Police Data:\n* Nearly two child sexual abuse offences per day linked to grooming gangs\n* 717 grooming crimes recorded in 2023\n* 572 additional cases in first nine months of 2024\n* First comprehensive national data collection of its kind\n* Political Context:\n* Labour has blocked a national inquiry into the scandal\n* Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces scrutiny over his role as former CPS head\n* Controversy over Labour’s adoption of the APPG definition of Islamophobia\n* Kemi Badenoch and Elon Musk have backed calls for an inquiry\n* Local Political Implications:\n* Streeting represents Ilford North, where Muslims comprise 32.5% of constituents\n* Won his last election by only 528 votes\n* Previously co-chaired the APPG on British Muslims\n* New Developments:\n* Implementation of the “Hydrant Programme” for data collection\n* First systematic analysis of group-based child sexual abuse\n* Includes collection of perpetrator demographic information\n* Response to Alexis Jay’s inquiry highlighting data collection failures\nThe controversy highlights the ongoing challenge of addressing serious criminal behaviour while maintaining community cohesion and preventing discrimination.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_yvette-cooper-considering-youth-mobility-scheme/content_402.html": "Yvette Cooper Considering Youth Mobility Scheme\nPlans Would Allow Young Britons to Work and Study on the Continent on a One In, One Out Basis\nThe Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, is reportedly amenable to establishing a youth mobility scheme with the European Union that would operate on a strictly balanced exchange basis. This represents a significant shift in position for one of the Cabinet’s most prominent voices on migration policy.\nPreviously, Ms Cooper had been identified as the most senior Cabinet minister expressing reservations about the proposal, primarily due to concerns that such an arrangement might exacerbate the politically contentious net migration statistics that have long featured prominently in British political discourse. Her initial reluctance stemmed from apprehensions that the scheme might become a flashpoint in ongoing debates about immigration controls.\nMinisters within the Labour government are currently deliberating whether to commit to such an initiative, which would create reciprocal opportunities for young British citizens to pursue employment and educational endeavours across Continental Europe. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, is understood to be supportive of British participation in the programme, viewing it as a potential catalyst for rejuvenating the nation’s underperforming economy by enhancing skills exchange and fostering international experience among Britain’s youth workforce.\nSources within government circles have disclosed to The Times newspaper that the Home Secretary has revised her stance and is no longer fundamentally opposed to the concept, having been reassured that implementing a stringent numerical cap—directly linked to the quantity of young Britons departing the UK—would result in negligible impact on overall migration figures. This numerical parity appears to have assuaged her primary concern about the scheme’s potential demographic implications.\nIn earlier discussions, Ms Cooper had expressed opposition to provisions allowing European participants to remain in the United Kingdom for periods exceeding twelve months, as individuals residing beyond this threshold are factored into the official net migration calculations. However, permitting longer-term residency has emerged as a fundamental requirement from European Union negotiators during preliminary consultations on the proposed scheme.\nAccording to recent reports, the Home Secretary appears to have withdrawn her objections to permitting young Europeans more extended residency periods, conditional upon the strict implementation of the one-for-one exchange mechanism. This represents a significant concession in the government’s negotiating position and potentially removes a substantial obstacle to reaching agreement with Brussels.\nNevertheless, Ms Cooper remains steadfastly committed to incorporating robust safeguards to prevent potential misuse of the scheme by individuals who might overstay their allotted visa periods. One particularly stringent measure reportedly under consideration is a categorical prohibition preventing any individual who enters Britain under the auspices of this youth mobility programme from subsequently submitting asylum applications within the UK, effectively closing off a potential pathway to permanent settlement.\nA source within the Home Office, speaking to The Times on condition of anonymity, emphasised the minister’s unwavering focus on migration controls: “Yvette’s primary objective is to reduce net migration and any discussion about visa schemes needs to be seen in that light. It needs very careful thought.”\nThe proposed asylum restriction is being considered as a preventative measure against a potential influx of applications should nations such as Ukraine and Albania—whose citizens statistically demonstrate a markedly higher propensity to seek asylum in Britain compared to nationals from current EU member states—eventually achieve membership of the European bloc. This reflects ongoing concerns about the intersection between migration policy and international relations in a post-Brexit context.\nThe deliberations come against a backdrop of revealing statistics released last month indicating that migrants who remain in the UK beyond their visa expiration dates constitute nearly 40 per cent of all asylum applications processed. This proportion surpasses the number attributable to arrivals via unauthorised Channel crossings in small vessels, which has been the subject of intense political and media focus in recent years.\nThese revelations have prompted growing apprehension that standard visa programmes may be utilised by certain migrants as an alternative mechanism for securing permanent residency status in Britain, circumventing conventional immigration procedures. The potential youth mobility scheme would need to address these vulnerabilities through carefully calibrated eligibility criteria and enforcement provisions.\nThe evolving governmental position coincides with mounting pressure from within the Labour Party’s own ranks. More than sixty Labour Members of Parliament and members of the House of Lords have publicly declared their support for establishing a youth mobility arrangement by co-signing an open letter addressed to Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Minister for Europe, highlighting the cross-party momentum behind the initiative.\nThe collective parliamentary appeal emphasised that British participation in such a programme would “extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK,” underscoring the multifaceted benefits that proponents believe would accrue from closer engagement with European counterparts on youth exchange matters. This internal advocacy suggests a broader consensus within the governing party on the desirability of maintaining and enhancing certain forms of people-to-people interaction with Europe despite Britain’s formal departure from the EU’s institutional framework.\nLast week, The Telegraph newspaper revealed that British diplomatic representatives are approaching finalisation of an agreement to adopt Brussels’ food and veterinary standards framework, a development that prompted prominent Eurosceptic figures to caution that Sir Keir Starmer’s administration may be jeopardising prospective trade negotiations with the United States at a particularly delicate juncture by potentially excluding American agricultural products from the British market through regulatory alignment with European standards.\nFurther reports emerged earlier this week suggesting that the Prime Minister is prepared to offer concessions to Brussels regarding fishing rights—a highly symbolic and contentious aspect of UK-EU relations—in exchange for British participation in a collaborative European defence arrangement. This indicates a willingness to revisit multiple aspects of the post-Brexit relationship simultaneously as part of a comprehensive diplomatic reset.\nThese developments have unfolded against the backdrop of high-level diplomatic engagement, with Sir Keir recently conducting discussions with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, in advance of a crucial summit scheduled for next month. Cabinet ministers have expressed optimism that this gathering could facilitate a substantive recalibration of Britain’s relationship with the European Union, addressing friction points that have persisted since the formal separation.\nAccording to sources familiar with the discussions, both leaders explored a range of topics including the contentious issues of fishing rights and European security cooperation, suggesting an expansive agenda for future UK-EU dialogue that extends well beyond the specific question of youth mobility arrangements.\nThe youth mobility scheme represents one component of a broader diplomatic initiative by the Labour government to re-establish constructive working relationships with European partners while navigating the complex legacy of Brexit. The evolution of Cooper’s position reflects the practical compromises that may be necessary to balance domestic political imperatives with international cooperation objectives in the post-Brexit landscape.\nComment\nAs with everything that this administration do, this will be the thin end of the wedge. They will promise that it will be in a one-in, one-out basis, but that will not work and the plan is to drag us back into free movement by stealth.\nWhilst migration within the EU may be better than the disastrous influx that we are experiencing, the only way that this could have ever worked, would have been on a level playing field basis, but that did not and never would happen.\nWhen people can move to the UK and receive more benefits than they would do in their homeland, it is to be expected that they would want to move here with the British taxpayer footing the bill. this is before we take into account the pressure on essential services and the demand for housing, with all the best intention in the world, we cannot cope.\nThere is also the issue of 27 nations all tied to the same legal framework, but with some nations adhering to the rules and others not, which then results in the UK being under yet more pressure to provide for more people that it simply cannot afford.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-war-on-white-working-class-boys/content_334.html": "The war on white working class boys\nOver the past few decades, we have been a nation in social decline, ashamed of our history, our identity and our race. We have been party to a ‘Guerrilla War’ that has been perpetrated against our society by a growing force of subversive haters, who have multiplied and infiltrated every aspect of our daily lives.\nWhat began as a noble cause over a century ago, to emancipate women and right the wrongs of our institutional misogyny, was hijacked, somewhere along the way, this ‘creeping agenda’ gradually manipulated our right to speak, our right to have an opinion, eventually, our very right to exist.\nReferred to as the ‘Political Left’ really only serves to diminish the true hostility of this toxic threat to our society, it is more a movement that seeks to destroy all that is good about our beloved nation, though not perfect, still remains a model of democracy and equality on the world stage.\nNot satisfied with the drastic changes to our society, which in most cases have been for the better, this was not the real agenda of these dark forces, incremental steps were taken implement greater and greater ‘positive discrimination’ as it is called. The real definition of positive discrimination is not positive, it is the premeditated and legal aim to enable those who are not qualified for certain positions or opportunities to be hand-held and deceitfully assisted to leap-frog more qualified, intelligent and academically superior candidates, simply because the belong to a ‘minority’\nThe keyword here is ‘minority’ the precedents that were set to level-up any disadvantages that existed against women were gradually extended to race, ethnic group and eventually minorities. In fact, the benefits of being part of a minority are so great that Scotland actually petitioned to establish themselves as a different race, as did Roma Gypsies.\nOver the last three decades, Universities have actively pursued an agenda of diverse intakes of students, regardless of the fact that many of those inducted may not have been qualified to be there, they are hand-held in their induction, through their degrees and when the enter the jobs market, they are once again given priority, at the expense of white males, who are considered to be surplus to requirements’ in our modern topsy-turvy society. Laws have been passed to ensure that large corporations have a minimum percentage of employees from minorities, regardless of their qualifications.\nIs it any surprise that young white men are giving up on further education, relationships and life itself?\nFollowing a national drive to make undergraduate intakes more ‘diverse’, figures released on Thursday by the Department for Education showed that, for the first time, white young people are now proportionately the least likely of all major ethnic groups to attend our top universities.\nAmong Britain’s Chinese families, some 40.7 per cent of their youngsters made it to Oxford, Cambridge and others in the elite Russell Group in 2020-21. The figures for Asian young people were 16 per cent. It was 10.7 per cent for black families — and just 10.5 per cent among white ones.\nIf our universities really want to pursue racial equality, they should take a look at some other statistics released this week by the Department for Education.\nThese revealed the numbers of young people who go to university at all — not just the elite institutions. The results were even more striking. Fully 81 per cent of Chinese children, almost 66 per cent of Asian children and 48 per cent of mixed-race children go to any university nowadays.\nThe figure for white children? Just 40 per cent. The numbers are even more damning when you look at the details. Among children who receive free school meals\nOut of the white working-class — only 13.6 per cent go to university.\nThe only ethnic groups with even fewer children making it to university are Roma and Traveller Gipsy communities.\nThe figures are so alarming, that they are not only cause for concern, they should warrant the declaration of a national crisis, but instead, the media do little more than congratulate themselves for their part in the war on equality, what equality? This is a war on our culture, identity and race.\nThis is an orchestrated campaign that is slowly but surely putting our way of life in grave danger, with a budding generation of academically brainwashed youngsters entering the workplace, thanks to the vast left-wing presence in academia, those who dare to object have rapidly become the minority, or rather, we are told that they are, but they are not. We only need to watch left-wing media, such at the BBC to see that the presence of white males is a little as ten percent.\nThese distressing figures are not just about further education, they are a barometer of the state of our society, following a continued war that is perpetrated by those who seek to undermine it. If nothing is done to address this grave situation, there will invariably come a time when the stark reality will stare us in the face, but it will be too late.\n“We are a multicultural nation, white males are guilty, they have blood on their hands, they are now ‘surplus to requirements’ they say, but not in so many words!\nWhat does the future hold for a nation that is capitulating to this agenda en-mass? History can answer that one for us.\nConquered nations always rise again, but nations that surrender, vanish for ever.\nAlarmist? Yes it is, but sadly that is an empirical fact, and one that we are facing during our lifetime. it may take a decade, or even a century, but eventually this agenda will destroy all that has made this country what is today.\n“Rome was conquered and it never rose again” I hear you say.\nNot quite, Rome did not fall on the 4th of September 476AD when the Visogoths entered the city and deposed the last Roman Emperor, in fact, Rome fell many years before, when it allowed the very fundamental principles of its empire to be eroded, by capitulating to the left.\nAll societies that have moved to the left have been destroyed.\nSo true! We are all being misdirected and manipulated!",

This influx is equivalent to the population of a city the size of Doncaster arriving each year, raising concerns about the government’s ability to manage immigration effectively.\nRwanda Bill Faces Repeated Setbacks\nAmidst this looming increase in net migration, the government’s Rwanda Bill suffered yet another five defeats in the House of Lords last night, bringing the total number of setbacks to 10. The Bill, designed to deport illegal immigrants to Rwanda, has faced significant opposition from peers across the political spectrum, including Conservative members, as well as Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives.\nContradictory Statements on Immigration\nThe projected surge in net migration appears to contradict statements made by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt during the recent budget, where he repeatedly asserted the government’s intention to reduce migration and move away from an economy reliant on increased immigration to drive GDP growth. Instead, Hunt emphasized the need to focus on boosting GDP per capita, acknowledging that while the country’s overall wealth has been increasing, its distribution among the population has remained stagnant, potentially leading to a decline in individual prosperity.\nThe Impact of Immigration on Economic Prosperity\nThe significance of GDP per capita figures, is that as more people arrive in the country, unless they are net contributors, the existing wealth must be shared among a larger population, effectively making individuals poorer. Recent Dutch data that examined tax contributions by migrant origin, revealed that individuals from East Asia, Europe, and the Anglosphere tend to be net tax contributors, while those from the Middle East, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa are more likely to be net tax burdens over their lifetimes.\nThis disparity is down to the strength of education, health systems, and civil governance in the countries of origin, enabling immigrants from those regions to potentially make greater economic contributions. The “arrogant liberal assumption” that secular education and material redistribution can transform any individual from any background into an equally contributive citizen, suggesting that the reality is more nuanced.\nThe Importance of Low-Skilled Labor\nWhile acknowledging the value of low-skilled labor, such as bin collectors and street sweepers, Tomlinson argued that importing individuals for low-income jobs, who often bring their families, places additional burdens on public services like schools, healthcare, transportation, and housing. Unless these individuals are net contributors, which is often not the case, their presence can strain the nation’s resources.\nHistorical Context and Lack of Growth\nDespite assurances from successive governments, notably under Tony Blair’s leadership, that immigration would foster economic growth, T growth has remained relatively stagnant, even during periods of high immigration from Eastern Europe. The peak of immigration under the Blair and Brown years, around 2010-2011, when figures reached approximately 383,000, highlighting that the current Conservative government’s projections exceed even those levels.\nConcerns Over Data Transparency\nWe should be concerned by the government’s decision to stop collecting data on tax contributions by national origin, a move that is motivated by a desire to suppress information that contradicts the narrative of immigration being an “unmitigated good.” This lack of transparency raises questions about the government’s commitment to making informed, data-driven decisions on immigration policy.\nThe Rwanda Bill: A “Dead Cat Distraction Strategy”?\nWhile the government has focused heavily on combating illegal migration through the controversial Rwanda Bill, former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick described the policy as a “dead cat distraction strategy” that was never intended to work. As the Bill continues to face opposition in Parliament, some have questioned whether it serves as a diversion from the government’s failure to address legal immigration effectively.\nCalls for Domestic Skill Development\nIn response to the projected increase in net migration, Philip Ingram, a military veteran, emphasised the need for the government to prioritise domestic skill development, questioning why the UK seemingly struggles to train enough citizens to fill crucial roles, such as doctors. He suggested that relying heavily on imported labor is insulting to the capabilities of the British workforce.\nConclusion\nAs the debate over immigration policy intensifies, the government faces mounting pressure to reconcile its stated objectives with its actions. The projected surge in net migration, coupled with the repeated setbacks to the Rwanda Bill and concerns over data transparency, have fueled skepticism about the government’s commitment to managing immigration effectively. Addressing this challenge will require a comprehensive strategy that balances economic needs with social and cultural considerations, while fostering domestic skill development and ensuring transparency in decision-making processes.\nWe can only assume that this administration, as well as previous administrations have been party to a campaign of deceit, which has been executed against the British people, against their will and to their detriment.\nAlthough the total GDP may appear to rise as the population increases, the reality is that we have so many immigrants who ARE NOT net contributors, but are in fact a NET LOSS, that the reality has been that for SEVEN QUARTERS IN SUCCESSION the GDP per capita, that is the total GDP divided by the population has actually been falling. Therefore, immigration is making us poorer, it is causing a severe strain on our essential services, we already struggle to build enough houses for the existing citizens of the United Kingdom, but there is absolutely no way that we could build houses fast enough to deal with six and seven figure immigration.\nThe response to this is always the same narrative, Xenophobia and Racism.\nWe need Reform and we need it NOW!",

This startling statistic is likely to be a conservative estimate, hinting at a much more complex demographic challenge facing the nation.\nDemographic Uncertainty\nPinpointing the exact number of illegal immigrants in Britain remains an exercise in educated guesswork. The Pew Research Centre’s 2017 estimates ranged from 800,000 to 1.2 million individuals, with a recent consultancy study for Thames Water building upon these figures. However, the critical concern lies in the potential growth of these numbers in the intervening years.\nThe typical trajectory of illegal immigration involves individuals initially entering the United Kingdom through legitimate channels—as tourists, students, or temporary workers—and subsequently overstaying their visas. These individuals then integrate into local communities, often working within the informal economy, a process that has become increasingly seamless.\nInstitutional Tracking Failures\nPerhaps most alarming is the Home Office’s abdication of responsibility in tracking population movements. In 2020, the department discontinued publishing exit check statistics, effectively rendering comprehensive population tracking impossible. Prior to this cessation, the average annual count of visa overstayers stood at approximately 63,000 individuals.\nA rudimentary calculation reveals a potentially exponential growth in undocumented residents. Combining visa overstayers, individuals arriving via small boats, and other irregular migration routes, with deportation rates languishing at around 10,000 annually, suggests an potential increase of roughly 75,000 undocumented migrants each year. This could translate to an additional half-million individuals on top of the 2017 estimates.\nCorroborating Evidence of Population Discrepancies\nMultiple data points underscore the population tracking challenges. The Brexit process revealed a stunning miscalculation of EU citizens resident in the UK—initially thought to number three million, the actual figure approached six million. Similarly, the National Immunisation Service’s 2021 estimate of the over-18 population in England differed significantly from the Office for National Statistics’ figures—49.7 million versus 44.5 million.\nPractical and Social Implications\nThe consequences of this demographic uncertainty extend far beyond mere statistical inaccuracies. Public service planning becomes exponentially more challenging when population figures remain so fluid. Healthcare, education, and infrastructure provision all suffer from this fundamental lack of clarity.\nMoreover, the concentration of undocumented migrants in specific urban areas introduces complex social dynamics. These individuals, naturally hesitant to engage with authorities, may develop parallel social structures. The potential consequences include reduced community investment, increased tolerance for informal economic practices, and gradual neighbourhood deterioration.\nLondon serves as a particularly stark example, with over 40 per cent of its population now born overseas—a figure that has doubled in the past three decades. The city’s demographic transformation epitomises the broader national migration narrative.\nPolitical Response and Leadership Vacuum\nLocal and national political leadership appears distinctly underwhelmed by these challenges. London’s Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has repeatedly emphasised the city’s commitment to being “open, diverse, and welcoming,” yet seems reluctant to address the practical ramifications of such an approach.\nProposed solutions such as blanket amnesties are dismissed as counterproductive. Such approaches would likely exacerbate the issue by creating additional incentives for irregular migration, undermining the credibility of immigration enforcement mechanisms.\nThe Way Forward\nAddressing this complex challenge requires a multifaceted approach. Paramount among the necessary steps is restoring transparency and accountability within the Home Office’s immigration tracking systems. A robust, humane deportation programme must be prioritised, drawing inspiration from international best practices.\nCrucially, reducing legal migration pathways represents a fundamental prerequisite for managing the broader immigration landscape. By constraining legitimate entry routes, the government can potentially stem the flow of individuals who might subsequently become part of the undocumented population.\nThe current situation represents more than a mere administrative challenge. It strikes at the heart of social cohesion, potentially undermining the rights and contributions of law-abiding residents. The sense that significant numbers of individuals are circumventing legal frameworks corrodes public trust and social solidarity.\nWithout decisive, transparent action, the United Kingdom risks allowing this demographic uncertainty to become a permanent, increasingly problematic feature of its social landscape.\nSummary\n• Estimated One in 12 London Residents Are Illegal Immigrants\n– Potentially an underestimate of the actual numbers\n– Based on 2017 Pew Research Centre estimates of 800,000 to 1.2 million undocumented migrants\n• Home Office Tracking Failures\n– Stopped publishing exit check statistics in 2020\n– No accurate count of visa overstayers\n– Previous average was 63,000 people not leaving annually\n• Population Uncertainty\n– Estimated increase of 75,000 undocumented migrants annually\n– Potential half-million additional migrants since 2017\n– Significant discrepancies in population estimates\n– EU citizens: 3 million estimated vs. 6 million actual\n– Over-18 population: 44.5 million (ONS) vs. 49.7 million (National Immunisation Service)\n• Social and Practical Implications\n– Difficult public service planning\n– Concentration of undocumented migrants in specific areas\n– Potential decline in neighbourhood social structures\n– 40% of London’s population now born overseas\n• Recommended Actions\n– Restore Home Office immigration tracking\n– Implement robust deportation programme\n– Reduce legal migration pathways\n– Increase transparency in population monitoring\n• Political Response\n– Local leadership (e.g., Sadiq Khan) seen as unresponsive\n– Rejection of blanket amnesty proposals\n– Concern about erosion of social cohesion\n• Core Challenge\n– Inability to accurately determine UK population\n– Risk of undermining legal residents’ rights and social trust",

It is because what is being seen to be done, or rather the manner in which the climate is being exploited for political and financial gain, is not the same as what really needs to be done.\nIn recent years, we have had to endure crippling Green levies on our fuel and our energy. Hard working people struggling to keep warm, because the cost is prohibitive, but where is all that money going?\nhttps://youtu.be/o2eClqlYybQ?si=om_M0EX86FDjfBRH\nNet Zero costs the UK a total of £30bn, with £10bn alone, being used for subsidies, money given to businesses for projects considered to be Green, broadly deciphered, that means that people are making millions whilst you live in fear of turning your heating on.\nIs this actually helping the environment, or is this little more than outwardly virtue signalling and privately exploiting climate change for financial benefit?\nEmissions in the UK and Europe as a whole, have been decreasing for years, and provided that there is a clear directive it will continue to do so, and whilst this is important, it is NOT the immediate emergency, China increases it’s output of emissions by more than the entire total of the UK every month, if not more, they have over 800 coal fired power stations on the way, with India not far behind. In fact, China has polluted more in the last 5 years, than the UK has since the industrial revolution……..let that sink in.\nWhat constitutes a greater demand for action, hundreds of coal-fired power stations, with numbers increasing every month, or reducing one of the lowest emissions in the western world by little more than a slither?\nDoes extorting £30bn from the UK economy every year, to make those exploiting climate change rich change the weather?\nDoes forcing those who cannot afford to buy a new car to pay £17.50 per day to drive into London, whilst those who can afford to pay, are permitted to pollute as much as they wish actually change the weather?\nDo wind turbines run on wind, or do they run on subsidies…………….for the answer, follow the money!\nWe are losing thousands of acres of farmland to Solar farms and wind turbines, millions of trees being chopped down, but apparently, if we object, we are ignorant and we must follow the science, well I have done and every scientist worth their salt agrees, that the way to cool the planet down, is to PLANT TREES NOT CHOP THEM DOWN!\nIsn’t it strange that when it comes to this topic, scientists are so petrified of being cancelled, that they refuse to speak up? I can name one in particular, his name was David Bellamy, remember him?\nThere was a photo released a few years ago, of a Polar Bear on a small block of ice, with the message that the Bear’s environment was melting, but David Bellamy correctly responded to say that Polar Bears actively seek small blocks of ice, because they can reach the water on all sides to catch fish……this did not go down well with the narrative and David Bellamy was cancelled and has never been heard from on msm since.\nAny contradiction to the narrative is met with climate denier and climate delayer….especially by the likes of Ed Miliband who has serious plans to make you pay dearly! Here is a man, who is a disciple of the corporations, and one who is prepared to destroy our economy, just to earn himself a handsome reward when he leaves politics, like so many before him.\nSo what is important at this point? What would I do?\nI am very passionate about the climate, but I do not support virtue signalling, misinformed taxation and exploitation of the climate to control and punish the masses.\nFirstly: We must address what we can do immediately and one of the greatest threats to life on this planet is currently microplastics.\nJust last year at Glastonbury, there were thousands of young people there, all angry about the climate, being hosted by a very angry young Swedish girl (who incidentally has made millions out of being angry) but guess what they left behind?\nYes, over one million plastic bottles, the hypocrisy beggar’s belief!\nStep 1: Ban plastic bottles for water and soft drinks IMMEDIATELY and when I say immediately, I am talking within weeks or months.\nEvery public building, every shopping mall, market square, motorway services, railway station, airport and so on to have public water fountains within weeks.\nStep 2: Every other product that is sold in plastic to be assessed on a case by case basis until as many consumer products as possible are no longer sold in plastic.\nIt is an irrefutable fact that this would make a massive difference to the microplastics that are polluting our rivers and oceans and gradually making their way into the food chain.\nStep 3: ULEZ, the greatest political scam in decades. Central London is unique of course, with amazing transport facilities and most people don’t mind using it.\nI would propose a gradual reduction on long-stay parking within central London, discouraging people from driving into it creating a much more pleasant environment.\nFor outer London, I would propose the reduction of emissions on a sliding scale, over a decade at least, which would enable people to gradually buy cleaner car as they would normally do. What I do object to, is those who can pay, to pollute as much as they wish, this smacks of Dystopia to me, not climate change.\nStep 4: No more farming land to be set aside for solar or wind farms, all new buildings to have solar panels on their roofs, and whilst we lose essential farming land, South Korea has been installing solar panels on the central reservations of their motorways, providing clean energy and doubling as cover for a cycle lane, we cannot afford to lose any more farm land, we need to reach 75% of our food needs or risk starvation if there is another serious conflict, or is that the idea? I’ll let you decide.\nStep 5: We must seriously reconsider the trade we do with the likes of China, when they are choking the planet. This is where reality meets virtue signalling, because those in power do not want this, they are not concerned about cleaner air, they are concerned about Geopolitics and profit.\nWho is the climate denier here? You tell me?\nI fervently believe that we must take IMMEDIATE ACTION to reduce pollution and emissions, but tangible steps that make sense, not regulation, taxes and control, that is nothing more than an insult to science, the planet and the people.\nI want to see sensible steps being taken with immediate effect, steps that make sense and steps that you the people will understand and support, but there again, that would deny the likes of Ed Miliband the opportunity to punish you, exploit you and dictate to you, on the grounds of “climate change” with is premediated misdirection, in order to win favour with his globalist friends who want nothing more than to impost 15 minute cities upon you and turn your localities in to virtual open prisons.\nLet’s take steps to save our planet now, let’s do what we know will make a difference, but I do not and never will support the enslavement of the people under the guise of “Climate”\nWho really supports the care of our environment………..you tell me!",

As noted in Brussels, some important provisions of the Harmonised Legislation (Directive 2011/93 / EU), according to which, inter alia, do not constitute a criminal offence, sexual activities between children are sufficient if they are 14 years old and above.\nThe Commission’s letter was sent on 13/9/2018 and it took eight months before the relevant amending bill was tabled in Parliament, which should be voted by the following month at the latest in order to avoid the risk of taking measures against the Cyprus problem Republic.\nAs stated in the Commission’s letter, when the relevant Harmonised Legislation was adopted in 2014, Articles 8, 17, 20, 22, 24 and 25 of the Directive relating to consensual sexual activities were not properly transposed into national law, jurisdiction and coordination of criminal prosecution, protection of child victims in criminal investigations and measures against websites containing or disseminating child pornography. Both the Ministry of Labor and the Police have admitted, following the Commission’s comments to the Legal Service in writing, that there is no complete compliance of national legislation with the articles of the Directive mentioned.\nIn particular, the amending Bill, which the House is expected to adopt to comply with the European Commission’s recommendations, provides inter alia for the following:\n1 . Criminal offences under this Law do not constitute sexual offences as defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 6 when they are consensual among children who have not reached the age of consensus (in Cyprus the age of 17 is set, while in other EU countries range from 14 to 16 years) and the age difference between the two children does not exceed three years and provided they have a similar degree of psychological and physical development or maturity.\n2. Sexual activities as defined in paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 8 for the production, acquisition or possession of pornographic material involving children who have reached the age of sexual consent shall not constitute a criminal offence under this Law if the production and possession of such material is carried out with the consent of such children and for their own use only by the children concerned insofar as the acts do not include any abuse or even violence or exploitation or even extortion ting.\n3 . This article does not apply to the above cases if any of the children involved is under the age of 14 years.\n4. The courts of the Republic shall be entitled to prosecute offences provided for in this Law, namely offenses of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children as well as child pornography if they are committed by a citizen of the Republic in any foreign country irrespective of the fact that they constitute or not criminal offences at the place where they were committed.\nIt is worth mentioning that the relevant harmonising legislation instituted for the first time the blocking of websites with child pornography material following a prosecutor’s order. Additionally, a new criminal offence was defined as a “pornographic performance” so that criminal prosecution could also be brought in cases of transmission of such material by mobile or skype.\nVoting by June or termination\nOn 15 March 2019, the Legal Service notified the Commission of the provisions it would incorporate into the existing legislation as it was its suggestions. At the same time, a commitment has been made to the Commission that the bill will be passed by the end of June 2019 in order to avoid the risk of taking measures against the Republic of Cyprus. Failure to pass the bill by the deadline will leave the Republic exposed to a conviction in the event of an appeal against it by the Commission to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and possibly, at the discretion of the Court, and imposing\na periodic penalty payment or a periodic penalty payment until our national law fully complies with Directive 2011/93 / EU.\nMarriage from the age of 17 years old\nDuring the elaboration of the above-mentioned law, the Legal Service considered necessary the amendment of the Marriage Law, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior, for the purpose of better transposition of article 8 of the relevant Directive, so as to prohibit marriage between a minor who is of the age of sexual consent an adult much larger than that. At the same time marriage will be permitted between persons who have reached the age of 17 or the age difference between the two does not exceed three years and have a similar degree of psychological and physical development or maturity.\nCOMMENT\nThere has always been a case for reviewing the law on sex between minors. It is not right that two people around the age of consent becoming intimate, which is perfectly natural, should result in one of them facing prosecution (or mandatory rape charge and their name on the sex offender’s register in the UK) just because one of them has not quite reached the age of consent.\nSurely this is a simple matter to deal with, allowing some flexibility in the law to protect similar aged youths from falling foul of the law. However this law, has REALLY gone beyond the realms of morality. As it stands, this change in law will mean that sex with someone no more than 3 years younger than you will not be a crime, even if they are under the age of consent, that means that a 15 year old boy will be able to have sex with a 12 year old girl, yes that is correct A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL and it will not be a crime. Really? Is this where the moral compass of the Cypriot government is taking us?\nThis is at a time, when Cyprus is being FLOODED with migrants from cultures that would think nothing of having sex with a 12 year old. What is worse, is that in the tragic event that a young girl is raped, with convictions for rape being so low, the courts will have no other option but to allow the offender to walk free.\nThis is a bad decision for Cyprus, it has left the young more vulnerable than ever.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-eu-admits-that-it-needs-britain-more-than-we-need-it/content_1176.html": "The EU admits that it needs Britain more than we need it\nBritain Holds the Upper Hand in Negotiations with the EU\nThe European Union has finally acknowledged its need for Britain is greater than Britain’s need for the EU. This week’s offer from Brussels to reinstate a form of freedom of movement for 18 to 30-year-olds between the UK and EU will undoubtedly be welcomed by those dreaming of a year or two abroad. Young people would no longer require work permits or visas, granting them the freedom to move to whichever EU country they desire.\nHowever, for those with memories stretching back to the gruelling Brexit debate from 2016 onwards – and the condescending lectures from the chief negotiator Michel Barnier – the EU’s proposition comes as a surprise. We were repeatedly told during the Brexit negotiations that it was impossible to “cherry pick” parts of the EU package. Membership in the single market, free movement, hosting financial markets, or participating in various programmes was contingent upon paying substantial budget contributions and accepting the EU’s full rulebook.\nNot only that, but the hardcore Remainers insufferably droned on about how the EU held all the cards and would always out-negotiate us. Yet, there is a deafening silence from that quarter now. Less than four years later, the EU is offering arrangements that were deemed completely impossible while we were in the process of leaving. We have already rejoined Horizon, and now a form of freedom of movement could be resurrected as well.\nOur response in this case should be a polite “no, thank you”.\nThe offer tells us two things. Firstly, the EU has realised that it needs us far more than we need it. Brussels has made the first move, offering to restore a version of one of the major features of membership. It undoubtedly hopes to tempt an incoming Labour government into renegotiating the entire deal, and with Starmer’s administration desperate to find ways of kickstarting growth, it may well agree.\nWe can expect a flurry of ambitious proposals in the months ahead as an election looms, and even more if Labour wins, as it almost inevitably will. The EU needs access to lucrative UK markets, especially in sectors such as autos and agriculture. The EU misses the UK’s substantial budget contributions and the profits from our markets, and it will try to win them back.\nSecondly, however, the UK needs to learn how to stand up for its own interests. Sure, it would be great for young people to have the freedom to work and study in an EU country. We all benefit from remaining open to new ideas and experiences.\nYet, there are significant problems with the proposal the EU has made. To begin with, like so many offers from the bureaucrats in Brussels, it is completely one-sided. Anyone aged 18 to 30 from the EU can come here, but at least under the draft proposals published so far, the British can only go to one EU country.\nMore importantly, however, the UK’s open labour market makes it easy for people to move here, but very few go in the other direction. If we rewind to the heyday of free movement, the traffic was overwhelmingly one-way. The government estimated that three million people had moved to Britain from 2000 onwards, but since no one counted the figures properly, it was hard to know precisely.\nAs it turned out, officials had got the estimates completely wrong. Under the “settled status” rules that allowed people from the EU to stay in Britain if they were already here, there were over seven million applications, or more than double the number expected, and given that some people decided not to stay, the real total could have been eight or even nine million.\nAnd how many went from the UK to Europe? The UN estimates that there were about 900,000 UK citizens living in the rest of the EU in 2019, many of them retirees on the coasts of Spain or Portugal.\nYoung Poles, Hungarians and Italians flocked to Britain, assuming that they could make better money here than they could at home, or else to escape suffocating regulations that locked them out of the labour markets.\nLikewise, under the Erasmus programme for students, statistics from 2018 show that 32,000 EU nationals were funded to come to the UK, while an estimated 17,000 British students went to study in the rest of the Continent.\nAdd it all up, and one point is clear. Young British people hardly ever went to work elsewhere in the EU for anything more than a summer job in the sunshine; neither did they study there. They don’t speak the language, and there aren’t any jobs anyway. In effect, the EU dumped its youth unemployment on us, in the same way the Chinese dump cheap phones and cars.\nIt made sense for them, but it was a rotten deal for the UK. And now they want to do it all over again.\nThe broader point is that the UK needs to curb its addiction to imported labour. We have made a terrible job of it so far, but at least we have the right in principle to control our own borders. The last thing we need is another wave of immigrants from across the EU.\nIt would be great to be on better terms with Brussels, and there are parts of the Brexit agreement that could be improved. But the EU has just demonstrated that it needs us more than we need it, and it is willing to negotiate. The UK does not need a return to any form of free movement.\nInstead, Britain should leverage its newfound position of strength to extract more favourable terms from the EU. We must protect our labour market and prioritise opportunities for British workers, while also maintaining our ability to attract top talent from around the world on our own terms.\nThe UK’s departure from the EU has proven to be a boon, freeing us from the bureaucratic shackles of Brussels and allowing us to forge our own path. Rather than succumbing to the EU’s tactics, we should seize this opportunity to negotiate a deal that truly serves Britain’s best interests.\nAfter all, it is the EU that has come knocking, offering concessions that were once deemed unthinkable. This underscores the reality that the balance of power has shifted, and Britain holds the upper hand in these negotiations. We must approach them with a steadfast commitment to protecting our sovereignty and securing a deal that benefits our nation and its people.\nIn Summary\n- The EU has admitted it needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU by offering to restore some freedom of movement for 18-30 year olds\n- This is a surprise after being told during Brexit negotiations that “cherry picking” parts of EU membership was impossible\n- The UK should politely decline the EU’s offer for several reasons:\n- It is a one-sided offer favoring the EU\n- Very few young Brits actually went to work/study in other EU countries pre-Brexit\n- The UK was effectively taking the EU’s unemployed youth under freedom of movement\n• Key takeaways:\n- The EU needs access to UK markets and misses UK contributions more than vice versa\n- The UK must learn to stand up for its own interests in future negotiations\n- Britain should curb its addiction to imported labour\n- The UK does not need to return to any form of free movement with the EU\n- With the EU demonstrating its need for a deal, Britain holds the upper hand\n- Britain should leverage this position of strength to extract more favorable terms, prioritizing British workers while still attracting global talent\nConclusion\nThe EU has been playing a game of bluff and deceit, which thanks to the media pandering to their mistruths, has caused great divisions in our society. By its very nature, the EU is insidious, autocratic, unelected, unaccountable and now, it is desperately fighting to survive!\nExaggeration? We need only take a look at the continual slide of the EU in to insignificance, which has accelerated significantly since we left. In 1970, in its current size, the EU represented 35% of global trade, (this had already dropped significantly over the last century, the days of Europe being the glorious centre of trade are long gone) but by 2017 it had dropped to just 22% including the UK, by 2022 it had dropped to 16.6% without the UK, by 2023 it had fallen to less than 15% and it is on course slip below 10% of global trade by the end of the decade.\nIs this a club that we should be chained at the hip to? Is this an organisation that we should permit to shackle us and prevent us from making our own trade deals and controlling our own destiny? I say not, the EU is facing extinction in its current form and they know it.\nWe must show no regret for leaving this terrible restrictive institution.",

How can Kahn justify this? Let’s not forget that this was first implemented by Boris Johnson, this is not about reducing emissions, it is about revenue raising, because by it’s very nature, the system permits those who can afford to pay, to pollute as much as they wish.\nWould it not have been far more effective and widely supported, if a limit on emissions were imposed? What if vehicles with an emission exceeding 300g were banned and what if that limit were reduced on a sliding scale over a decade? Who would have objected to that? Manufacturers taking steps to meet the targets, existing vehicles gradually removed through natural wastage and the additional benefit of preventing the ‘summer playboys’ form flying their supercars over in the summer and hogging the roads of London.\nThis graph details the average end-user cost per kw/h to the UK public. France has been basically shielded due to it’s self sufficiency thanks to Nuclear energy, the USA is basically non-dependant on energy, in Germany and Spain, it is highly subsidised, yet the British public are being penalised, due to Green Levies, imposed by politicians who are only concerned with something to boast about at dinner parties.\nThere have been great advances made in recent years, and although a large part of our energy does indeed come from renewables, although their indirect impact on the environment and certainly the damage to the aesthetics of our countryside, it is accepted that they cannot be relied upon, to replace other forms of energy. When the wind did not blow in Germany for months and months, it actually caused a localised energy crisis, because in their hast to move to renewables, they did not factor for the unreliability of the wind and the sun.\nRolls Royce are producing small modular nuclear reactors that are not only small and discreet, therefore easily disguised as a building, but the cost of construction, placement and management is a fraction of a traditional nuclear power station, yet each one could easily power a city. It was lack of foresight twenty or thirty years ago that has led to our current dependency on other nations and fossil fuels for our energy, a price that is paid but everyday people once again.",

It didn’t seem to matter who they were: men or women, Italian citizens, “regular” immigrants or asylum seekers. So long as they were black. A shooting rampage against African migrants in the town of Macerata, in central Italy on February 2, unveiled the extent to which the debate about migration in Italy is shaped by fascist forces and racist ideas.\nBy the end of the rampage, six people had been shot, one woman and five men. One is in a regional hospital with a chest injury, the others suffered lesser injuries and are in stable conditions. A 28-year-old man called Luca Traini, arrested at the scene draped in an Italian flag, was charged with an attempted racially-aggravated massacre. A copy of Mein Kampf and books on fascism in Italy were reportedly found at his flat. In 2017, Traini stood as a candidate for the far right Lega Nord at a local election, albeit scoring zero votes.\nThe attack came soon after the macabre death of Pamela Mastropietro, whose dismembered body was found in two suitcases in late January, dumped along the road near Macerata. A Nigerian man called Innocent Oseghale residing in Italy with an expired permesso di soggiorno (or permit of stay) was arrested the day after, accused of killing her.\nExtra-ordinary lives\nI never met Gideon Atzeke, Jennifer Otioto or any of the other victims of the attack, and hardly anyone has mentioned who they were. But I did meet many asylum seekers in Macerata in summer 2017 during my research on the Italian government’s reception system for asylum seekers. And even then, the everyday and institutional racism confronting them seemed to be their main preoccupation.\nTalking to them on the phone in the days since the attack I’ve been struck by the fatalist nature with which they processed the events. A sign, perhaps, of their extraordinary lives, and of their ordinary fears, aspirations, and claims for a secure and decent life, all of which which are constantly devalued and obscured by the migration debate.\nSome Nigerians blamed the accusations against Oshigale for putting “all Nigerians in a bad light”. Others evoked the violent and racist abuse they faced in Libya, drawing explicit parallels between their treatments in the two countries. Unfortunately, all seemed to agree that it was best for them to stay put in the hotels and houses where they are hosted, as they wait for their asylum claim to be processed.\nI strongly encouraged them not to do so, and to join the various protests and marches that have already taken place or that are planned.\nOrdinary racism\nThe attempted massacre appears to epitomise how fascist groups and ideas have been mainstreamed and glamorised in Italy, particularly in the run-up to elections on March 4.\nAfter his arrest, Traini was heralded as a patriot by some on social media. Forza Nuova, the party founded by the far right politician Roberto Fiore, expressed full support for Traini and offered to pay his legal expenses.\nOther political parties distanced themselves from his alleged actions. Yet they still managed to shift attention away from the political context of the rampage.\nCasapound, a far right group, condemned the attack, and denied reports of Traini’s affiliation with them. Roberto Salvini, leader of the Lega Nord, tried to minimise Traini’s past candidature for his party, and linked the event to the “social confrontation” that is brought about by “uncontrolled migration”.\nSilvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister and leader of Forza Italia, defined immigration as a “social bomb about to explode” and pledged to deport up to 600,000 irregular migrants. Other right wing parties, such as Fratelli d’Italia, used the events to emphasise their belief that Italy faces a security emergency caused by migration, which needs a strong response from the state.\nMarco Minniti, Italy’s minister of the interior, a member of the Partito Democratico, appealed for unity. He tried to placate the situation by insisting that the shootings were unorganised and carried out by a loose cannon. The Five Star Movement, the largest party in Italy according to polls, insisted that it was the responsibility of political parties to maintain “silence” about the attack.\nAs the migrant support group Coordinamento Migranti asserted, underlying these responses lies a growing racism which pervades Italian politics and which frames migration as a threat to Italians, and seeks to legitimise military and security solutions.\nI believe this was an act of terrorism and that it wasn’t an isolated event, but the latest episode of a series of fascist aggressions aimed at intimidating immigrants and those who support them. A strong mobilisation is required against this drift.\nCOMMENT\nThere is no doubt that most of Europe has moved to the right at an alarming rate. It is not possible to subjegate so many people and make them second class citizens in their own homeland. The indigenous people of Europe have been wrapped up in knots by political correctness, which is designed to gag them and prevent objection to the never ending torrent of migrants that are not just threatening the very identity of Europe, but is increasingly a threat to the Europeans as a whole.\nThis will not end well, as Europe moves further to the right, this serves as a barometer that the people of Europe are themselves becoming increasing drawn to resisting the narrative of the political classes. There is a great risk that the resistance will come from within, as Europe hurtles towards a political implosion not seen since the 1930s. On that note, why does it feel that we are fast approaching a re-run of 1933?",

Presently, the Eurozone stands at the brink of a potential currency collapse. A faltering economy, coupled with surging inflation and the imminent threat of an interest rate time bomb, have cast a shadow of uncertainty over the euro’s future. The European Central Bank (ECB) finds itself at a crossroads, compelled to make a pivotal decision that could redefine the trajectory of the euro.\nThe Warning Signs\nBob Lyddon, a perceptive tax consultant based in the UK, has sounded a clarion call, drawing attention to the imminent threats that loom over the euro’s stability. Commerzbank, a prominent Frankfurt-based institution, has concurred with Lyddon’s assessment, underscoring the mounting pressures the euro faces due to developments across the Atlantic. As the euro teeters at €1.10, with a precarious 0.86 against the pound, it becomes evident that the challenges confronting the Eurozone are both multifaceted and pressing.\nDepleted Arsenal: ECB’s Dilemma\nLyddon’s analysis lays bare the ECB’s depletion of policy tools to counter the Eurozone’s economic decline. As the ECB scales back its bond-buying and lending programs, interest rates rise, and the money supply dwindles. This policy quagmire leaves the ECB with an unenviable choice: either risk unsettling the currency by hiking interest rates or maintain the status quo and potentially witness the euro’s downfall.\nDance with Inflation: Eurozone’s Balancing Act\nAt the heart of this conundrum lies the Eurozone’s grappling with inflation. Much like the Bank of England’s delayed response to inflation was overshadowed by the Federal Reserve’s proactive stance, the ECB faces a similar predicament. The Eurozone’s failure to address inflation in a timely manner has propelled the necessity of mirroring the Federal Reserve’s actions to avert a currency crisis. In essence, the Eurozone has transformed into a “tracker fund,” mirroring the Fed’s steps to safeguard its own stability.\nVulnerabilities Amplified: Geopolitical Realities\nThe Eurozone’s vulnerabilities are amplified by its reliance on exports to China, a nation grappling with its own set of economic challenges. As China’s growth falters and geopolitical tensions simmer, Eurozone exports to this pivotal market are under threat. Furthermore, the Eurozone’s proximity to Ukraine adds another layer of uncertainty, encompassing energy supplies and the specter of potential conflict spillover.\nPressures Mount: Eurozone’s Contrasting Trajectory\nCommerzbank’s assessment sheds light on the Eurozone’s vulnerability. Unlike the United States, where the economy displays resilience, the Eurozone’s economic vigor is waning, exerting downward pressure on the euro. This downward trajectory is likely to persist unless the Eurozone can reverse its economic course.\nA Pivotal Decision Looms\nThe ECB’s impending decision on interest rates, slated for September 14, stands as a pivotal moment. This decision holds the power to dramatically alter the euro’s course. With inflation still well above the ECB’s two percent target and the shadow of a currency collapse looming, ECB President Christine Lagarde shoulders the daunting responsibility of steering the Eurozone through these tumultuous waters.\nIn the Maelstrom of Global Economics\nAs the global economic landscape undergoes dynamic shifts, the challenges facing the Eurozone epitomize the intricate interplay between policy, economy, and international dynamics. The fate of the euro hangs precariously in the balance, watched closely by observers worldwide. The upcoming weeks will bear witness to the ECB’s intricate dance between defending the euro’s stability and averting its potential downfall. The decisions undertaken in this critical phase will not only shape the Eurozone’s economic future but also weave a thread into the broader tapestry of global financial stability.\nConclusion\nIn a world where economic stability is a delicate interplay of policies, indicators, and global forces, the Eurozone finds itself at a crossroads of significant proportions. The prospect of a currency collapse looms large as a weakened economy grapples with mounting inflation and the imminent challenge of interest rate adjustments. This complex scenario places the European Central Bank (ECB) in a position of immense responsibility, requiring a careful balancing act to safeguard the euro’s future.\nThe warnings from experts like Bob Lyddon and the resonance found in Commerzbank’s concerns paint a vivid picture of the Eurozone’s vulnerabilities. The currency’s value teeters as economic pressures mount, and the ECB faces a dilemma: navigate a challenging policy landscape or risk the currency’s downfall. The Eurozone’s dance with inflation, its dependence on exports to an uncertain China, and the geopolitical tensions it faces, all add layers of complexity to the situation.\nAs September approaches, the ECB’s looming decision on interest rates will be a defining moment. The outcomes will ripple through the Eurozone and resonate on the global stage. The journey ahead requires the ECB, under the leadership of Christine Lagarde, to make calculated choices to preserve stability and avert crisis. The echoes of the decision will reverberate not only within the Eurozone’s economic trajectory but also across the broader tapestry of international finance.\nIn the grand mosaic of the global economy, the Eurozone’s predicament serves as a vivid reminder of the intricate dance between policy responses, economic realities, and geopolitical dynamics. The fate of the euro is no longer just a regional concern; it’s a matter of international significance. As observers and stakeholders watch intently, the ECB’s decisions in the coming weeks will set the tone for what lies ahead, defining not only the Eurozone’s economic destiny but also contributing to shaping the contours of the global financial landscape. In these times of uncertainty, one thing is clear: the Eurozone’s journey ahead will require resilience, adaptability, and strategic acumen to navigate through the turbulence and emerge stronger on the other side.",

European leaders arriving at the Munich Security Conference today find themselves grappling with an unprecedented situation, following the revelation that President Donald Trump conducted a private 90-minute telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call, made without any prior consultation with Ukraine or NATO allies, has cast a long shadow over the conference’s proceedings.\nTrump’s subsequent announcement that direct negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine would commence ‘immediately’, coupled with his proposal for a summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has left European diplomats and security experts reeling. This unilateral diplomatic manoeuvre effectively terminates Putin’s international isolation and raises profound questions about the future of European security architecture.\n## The Diplomatic Earthquake\nThe ramifications of Trump’s unexpected diplomatic gambit extend far beyond mere protocol breaches. By single-handedly upending decades of carefully calibrated Western policy towards Russia, Trump has initiated what French President Emmanuel Macron describes as an ‘electroshock’ to the European security establishment.\nThe timing of this dramatic shift could not be more significant. As defence ministers, intelligence chiefs, and security experts converge on Munich—a city whose name remains forever linked to historical attempts at appeasement—the parallels with past diplomatic failures are impossible to ignore.\n## A Negotiating Strategy Under Fire\nTrump’s reputation as a dealmaker has suffered a devastating blow. In an unprecedented departure from conventional negotiating wisdom, his administration has preemptively surrendered key bargaining positions before formal talks have even begun. The public declaration that Ukraine will be permanently excluded from NATO membership, coupled with implicit acceptance of Russia’s territorial gains and an explicit refusal to commit American troops to Ukraine’s defence, has drawn sharp criticism from allies.\nGermany’s Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, articulated the widespread dismay, pointing out the fundamental flaw in surrendering crucial negotiating leverage before discussions commence. The word ‘appeasement’ has begun circulating among conference attendees, its usage deliberately chosen to evoke the ghost of 1938 in these same Bavarian halls.\n## The Broader Implications for Global Order\nYet the implications of Trump’s actions stretch far beyond the immediate crisis. His approach represents a fundamental repudiation of the post-war international order that America itself architected. The president has demonstrated with stark clarity that traditional alliances and friendships hold little weight when measured against his narrow interpretation of American interests.\nThe reverberations of this shift are particularly acute within NATO, where Trump’s actions have dealt a potentially fatal blow to the principle of collective defence—Article 5’s promise that an attack on one is an attack on all. This cornerstone of European security, which has underpinned continental peace for three-quarters of a century, now appears increasingly fragile.\n## European Response and Strategic Autonomy\nEuropean nations now face a complex trinity of challenges: sustaining support for Ukraine, ensuring continental defence, and recalibrating their relationship with an increasingly unreliable American partner.\nRegarding Ukraine, Europe retains several significant leverage points. The continent controls the majority of frozen Russian assets, which will inevitably feature in any negotiation with Moscow. Additionally, Europe’s position as a major energy consumer provides some negotiating power, though internal pressures—particularly visible in Germany’s election discourse—are pushing for a return to cheaper Russian gas supplies.\n## The Security Guarantee Conundrum\nPerhaps most troublingly, the United States has explicitly abdicated responsibility for defending any potential ceasefire line between Ukraine and Russia, leaving this critical task to European nations. This creates an enormous practical challenge: any meaningful security guarantee would likely require substantial military commitments from Britain, France, and Poland.\nFor the United Kingdom, this presents a particularly acute dilemma. Any significant deployment would consume nearly all of Britain’s already stretched military resources. Moreover, the effectiveness of any European security guarantee appears questionable without access to American air power and advanced missile systems, though Trump’s team has hinted at potential availability of these assets.\n## The Financial Reckoning\nTrump’s call for NATO members to increase defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP—effectively doubling current military expenditure—presents European nations with stark choices. This demand may require fundamental reconsideration of the fiscal rules that have governed European economic policy for decades.\nThe political implications are equally challenging. European leaders must now contemplate reducing social welfare programmes, healthcare provision, and pension benefits to fund increased defence spending—a politically toxic proposition in many countries.\n## Britain’s Strategic Crossroads\nThe United Kingdom faces its own set of difficult decisions. While political support for Ukraine remains robust across party lines, the practical challenges of increasing defence spending are daunting. The government’s pledge to raise spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP from the current 2.3 per cent lacks a concrete timeline.\nLord Robertson’s forthcoming defence review is expected to paint a sobering picture of British military readiness, with reports suggesting UK forces possess less than three days’ worth of ammunition. With the nuclear deterrent already consuming 0.8 per cent of GDP, finding additional resources for conventional forces presents a significant challenge.\n## The Transatlantic Relationship at a Crossroads\nThe broader question of maintaining close ties with the United States has become increasingly complex. The previously straightforward calculation based on shared values and commercial interests now appears less convincing. Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on countries that charge VAT, including both the EU and UK, adds another layer of uncertainty.\nBritain’s diplomatic positioning reflects this complexity. While declining to sign a recent agreement on AI governance alongside the US, it has openly criticised Trump’s proposed approach to Gaza. These developments may accelerate Britain’s pursuit of closer alignment with the EU, as both entities explore strengthened relationships with partners in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.\n## Looking Ahead: European Unity in Question\nThe immediate focus of the Munich Conference remains supporting Ukraine, but the challenges extend far beyond this immediate crisis. Europe’s ability to present a unified front in strengthening its defence capabilities faces significant hurdles, particularly given political uncertainties in France and Germany.\nEven if European nations can overcome these obstacles and achieve unprecedented levels of military cooperation and investment, a fundamental question remains: Can Europe effectively deter a wounded but aggressive Russia without American backing?\nThe coming months will prove crucial in answering these questions and determining whether Europe can forge a new path toward strategic autonomy in an increasingly uncertain world. The stark reality is that the transatlantic security relationship, which has underpinned global stability for generations, may never be the same again.",

This development comes after a tumultuous three-month tenure in the corridors of power at Number 10 Downing Street.\nMs Gray, a former high-ranking civil servant with a reputation for impartiality and thoroughness, has accepted a new role as the Prime Minister’s envoy for the regions and nations of the United Kingdom. This move marks a significant shift in her career trajectory, transitioning from a party-political role to one that ostensibly serves the broader interests of the nation.\nThe announcement of her departure has sent ripples through the political establishment, with many speculating about the underlying reasons for her decision. Ms Gray’s tenure as chief of staff had been marred by a series of hostile briefings from rival Labour figures, who expressed concerns about the extent of her influence over the operations of Number 10. These anonymous sources suggested that Ms Gray wielded an inordinate amount of power, potentially overshadowing other key figures within the party hierarchy.\nAdding fuel to the fire of controversy, details of Ms Gray’s salary were leaked to the press, revealing that she earned £3,000 more than Sir Keir Starmer himself. This disclosure raised eyebrows and prompted questions about the appropriateness of such a remuneration package for a non-elected official.\nIn a carefully worded statement, Ms Gray addressed the circumstances surrounding her resignation. She said, “After spearheading the Labour Party’s preparations for government and initiating work on our programme for change, I am looking forward to drawing upon my extensive experience to support the Prime Minister and the Cabinet in their efforts to deliver the government’s objectives across the nations and regions of the United Kingdom.”\nMs Gray went on to emphasise her long-standing commitment to public service, stating, “Throughout my career, my primary interest has always been in serving the public. However, in recent weeks, it has become increasingly apparent to me that the intense scrutiny and commentary surrounding my position risked becoming a significant distraction from the government’s vital work of implementing change.”\nShe continued, “It is for this reason that I have made the difficult decision to stand aside. Nevertheless, I eagerly anticipate continuing to support the Prime Minister in my new role as envoy for the regions and nations.”\nThe departure of Ms Gray marks the end of a brief but impactful chapter in Labour Party politics. Her appointment as chief of staff had been seen as a coup for Sir Keir Starmer, given her reputation for competence and her intimate knowledge of the inner workings of Whitehall. However, her presence also raised questions about the blurring of lines between civil service impartiality and party-political roles.\nSir Keir Starmer, in response to Ms Gray’s resignation, issued a statement expressing his gratitude for her contributions. He said, “I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to Sue for all the invaluable support she has provided to me, both during our time in opposition and now in government. Her work in preparing us for the responsibilities of governance and in getting our programme of change off the ground has been invaluable.”\nThe Labour leader went on to highlight Ms Gray’s achievements in her role, particularly in the realm of intergovernmental relations. “Sue has played a pivotal role in strengthening our relationships with the regions and nations of the United Kingdom. I am delighted that she will continue to lend her expertise to this crucial area of work in her new capacity.”\nMs Gray will be succeeded in her role as chief of staff by Morgan McSweeney, a long-time Labour Party operative with extensive experience in campaign management and political strategy. Mr McSweeney’s appointment is seen as a move to bring a more traditional party-political approach to the role, potentially allaying concerns from some quarters about the influence of former civil servants in Labour’s inner circle.\nThe transition comes at a critical juncture for the Labour government, as it seeks to implement its ambitious programme for change while navigating the complex political landscape of post-Brexit Britain. Ms Gray’s new role as envoy for the regions and nations is likely to be crucial in this regard, as the government seeks to address concerns about regional inequality and devolution.\nAs the dust settles on this latest shake-up in Downing Street, political observers will be keenly watching to see how these changes impact the direction and effectiveness of Sir Keir Starmer’s administration. The coming weeks and months will undoubtedly provide insight into whether this reshuffle will help to refocus the government’s efforts on its core priorities or whether it signals deeper divisions within the Labour Party’s power structures.",

This book delves into the various methods employed to manipulate and mould the thoughts, behaviours, and beliefs of individuals within a given society. It examines the historical context, psychological tactics, and technological advancements that have propelled social engineering to unprecedented levels.\nChapter by chapter, this book uncovers the origins and evolution of social engineering, shedding light on the ideological frameworks that influence societal development. It explores the power of propaganda, mass persuasion, and media manipulation, revealing how these tools are used to shape public opinion and control narratives.\nFurthermore, “Social Engineering: A Society by Design” investigates the role of education and social conditioning in shaping individuals’ values and attitudes. It delves into the ways in which consumerism is engineered through advertising and marketing techniques, as well as the influence of political agendas on societal norms and behaviours.\nThe book also explores the impact of technology on social engineering, from the pervasive surveillance mechanisms to the algorithms that shape our online experiences. It examines the role of social media in amplifying social engineering tactics and analyses the ethical implications of these practices.\nDrawing on historical case studies, this book examines real-world examples of social engineering, providing readers with a deeper understanding of its mechanisms and effects. It highlights moments in history when societies have been subjected to extensive social engineering, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and resilience in the face of manipulation.\n“Social Engineering: A Society by Design” also raises crucial questions about the ethical boundaries of social engineering. It prompts readers to consider the potential consequences and ethical implications of engineering societies to fit predetermined agendas.\nLastly, the book concludes by envisioning the future of social engineering, considering the impact of emerging technologies and the potential for positive social engineering initiatives. It emphasizes the importance of building a resilient society that is aware of and resistant to manipulation, fostering empowerment and collective well-being.\nWe have all heard about 1984 by George Orwell, which led to the term ‘Orewllian society’ but there are many facets to incremental decline in to dystopia, however there was a man who preceded George Orwell and was in fact one of his teachers, who had a different vision, one that would precede and actually lay the foundation for the social structure that will follow.\nThere are many different ways that society can be controlled, with different philosophers, sighting different opinions, definitions and predictions, however for the purposes of my research, I have selected a few definitions that relate to my personal thoughts.\nWhen social structure is concerned, by far the most common visual conceptualisation tends to be linear, polarise, either one extreme or another:\nSocialism < …………………………………> Capitalism\nUtopia < …………………………………> Dystopia\nCollectivism < …………………………………> Individualism\nConservatism < …………………………………> Hedonism\n…………and so on.\nIt is my opinion, that the linear concept has been the norm as much by design, as it is by evolution, because the most important factor in any form of social engineering is ‘polarisation’\nIn ancient Rome & Greece, there were the Greeks and the Romans, but everyone else were ‘Barbarians’\nDuring the Muslim wars, there were Muslims and ‘infidels’\nDuring the Crusades, there were Christians and Saracens\nAnd so it continues, because when the masses have the linear concept in their minds, they know that they are on one side or another.\nHowever, I would argue, that in reality, all social structures are not linear, but circular, in fact any number of circles overlapping one another in the shape of a Venn diagram, with all the circles moving around like positively charged Ions, changing the dynamics of the society that they influence.\nWhy is this important?\nI fervently believe that this is crucial if we are to understand how fragile our society really is, but more importantly, unlike the linear example, where society would in essence need to swing from one side to another, using the circular structure to define the different influences on society and decipher their impact upon us.\nWhat is further highlighted by the circular example, is that it demonstrates how different aspects of social structure can have a greater influence on society, incrementally and more importantly, by stealth.\nWe need only reflect on the changes to our society over the last two decades, to fully appreciate, just how much things have changed, but even for those who have lived through this period as mature adults, it is almost impossible to pinpoint what changed and when it changed, because this all crept up on us by stealth.\nThe truly astute social manipulators do not reveal their hand, they use the very same tactic that Houdini used, in his public feats of magic, which was in fact, little more than trickery, but the key, was misdirection.\nI would firstly like to refer to a speech made by the very wise literary great, Aldus Huxley, which he made before an audience at the Berkeley language centre in 1962.\nThe Ultimate Revolution: Aldus Huxley\nMarch 20, 1962 Berkeley Language Centre\n“First of all, I’d like to say that the conference at Santa Barbara was not directly concerned with the control of the mind. That was a conference—there have been two of them now, at the University of California Medical centre in San Francisco (one this year which I didn’t attend), and one two years ago where there was a considerable discussion on this subject—at Santa Barbara we were talking about technology in general and the effects it’s likely to have on society, and the problems related to the transplanting of technology into underdeveloped countries.\nWell now, in regard to this problem of the ultimate revolution: this has been very well summed up by the moderator. In the past we can say that all revolutions have essentially aimed at changing the environment in order to change the individual. I mean, there’s been the political revolution, the economic revolution, in the time of the reformation, the religious revolution. All these aimed, as I say, not directly at the human being, but at his surroundings. So that by modifying the surroundings you did remove an effect upon the human being.\nToday we are faced, I think, with the approach of what may be called the ultimate revolution, the final revolution, where man can act directly on the mind-body of his fellows. Well, needless to say, some kind of direct action on human mind-bodies has been going on since the beginning of time, but this has generally been of a violent nature. The Techniques of terrorism have been known from time immemorial, and people have employed them with more or less ingenuity, sometimes with the utmost cruelty, sometimes with a good deal of skill acquired by a process of trial and error, finding out the best ways of using torture, imprisonment, constraints of various kinds.\nBut as—I think it was Metternich—said many years ago: you can do everything with bayonets except sit on them. If you are going to control any population for any length of time, you must have some measure of consent. It’s exceedingly difficult to see how pure terrorism can function indefinitely. It can function for a fairly long time, but I think sooner or later you have to bring in an element of persuasion, an element of getting people to consent to what is happening to them.\nWell, it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this: that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy—who have always existed and presumably will always exist—to get people actually to love their servitude. This is, it seems to me, the ultimate in malevolent revolutions, shall we say. And this is a problem which has interested me for many years and about which I wrote thirty years ago a fable, Brave New World, which is essentially the account of a society (making use of all the devices at that time available, and some of the devices which I imagined to be possible) making use of them in order to, first of all, to standardize the population, to iron out inconvenient human differences, to create, so to say, mass-produced models of human beings arranged in kind of a scientific caste system.\nAnd since then, I have continued to be extremely interested in this problem, and I have noticed with increasing dismay that a number of the predictions which were purely fantastic when I made them thirty years ago have come true, or seem in process of coming true; that a number of techniques about which I talked seem to be here already. And there seems to be a general movement in the direction of this kind of ultimate revolution, this method of control, by which a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which (by any decent standard) they ought not to enjoy—the enjoyment of servitude. Well, this process, as I say, has gone on for over the years, and I have become more and more interested in what is happening.\nAnd here I would like briefly to compare the parable of Brave New World with another parable which was put forth more recently in George Orwell’s book, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell wrote his book, I think, between 45 and 48, at the time when the Stalinist terror regime was still in full swing, and just after the collapse of the Hitlerian terror regime. And his book—which I admire greatly, it’s a book of very great talent and extraordinary ingenuity—shows, so to say, a projection into the future of the immediate past (of what for him was the immediate past) and the immediate present. It was a projection into the future of a society where control was exercised wholly by terrorism and violent attacks upon the mind-body of individuals.\nWhereas my own book—which was written in 1932, when there was only a mild dictatorship in the form of Mussolini in existence—was not overshadowed by the idea of terrorism, and I was therefore free in a way in which Orwell was not free, to think about these other methods of control, these non-violent methods. And I’m inclined to think that the scientific dictatorships of the future (and I think there are going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world) will be probably a good deal nearer to the Brave New World pattern than to the Nineteen Eighty-Four pattern. They will a good deal nearer not because of any humanitarian qualms of the scientific dictators, but simply because the Brave New World pattern is probably a good deal more efficient than the other. That, if you can get people to consent to the state of affairs in which they are living—the state of servitude, the state of being, having their differences ironed out, and being made amenable to mass production methods on the social level—if you can do this, then you are likely to have a much more stable and much more lasting society, a much more easily controllable society, than you would if you were relying wholly on clubs and firing squads and concentration camps.\nSo that my own feeling is that the Nineteen Eighty-Four picture was tinged, of course, by the immediate past and present in which Orwell was living, but the past and present of those years does not represent, I feel, the likely trend of what is going to happen. Needless to say, we shall never get rid of terrorism. This will always find its way to the surface. But I think that insofar as dictators become more and more scientific, more and more concerned with the technically perfectly running society, they will be more and more interested in the kind of techniques which I imagined and described from existing realities in Brave New World. So that, it seems to me, then, that this ultimate revolution is not really very far away; that already, the number of techniques for bringing about this kind of control are here. And it remains to be seen when and where and by whom they will first be applied in any large scale.\nAnd first, let me talk a little bit about the improvement, even, in the techniques of terrorism. I think there have been improvements. Pavlov, after all, made some extremely profound observations both on animals and on human beings. And he found, among other things, that conditioning techniques applied to animals or humans in a state either of psychological or physical stress sank in, so to say, very deeply into the mind-body of the creature, and were extremely difficult to get rid of; that they seemed to be embedded more deeply than other forms of conditioning. And this, of course, this fact, I think, was discovered empirically in the past. People did make use of many of these techniques. But the difference between the old empirical intuitive methods and our own methods is the difference between a, sort of, hit and miss craftsman’s point of view, and the genuinely scientific point of view. I mean, I think there is a real difference between ourselves and, say, the inquisitors of the sixteenth century. We know much more precisely what we are doing than they knew, and we can extend (because of our theoretical knowledge) what we are doing over a wider area with a greater assurance of producing something that really works.\nIn this context I would like to mention the extremely interesting chapters in Dr. William Sargant’s Battle for the Mind, where he points out how intuitively some of the great religious teachers, leaders, of the past hit on the Pavlovian method. He speaks specifically of Wesley’s method of producing conversions, which were essentially based upon a technique of heightening psychological stress to the limit by talking about hellfire, and so making people extremely vulnerable to suggestion, and then suddenly releasing this stress by offering hopes of heaven. And this is a very interesting chap—of showing how completely on purely intuitive and empirical grounds a skilled natural psychologist, as Wesley was, could discover these Pavlovian methods.\nWell, as I say, we now know the reason why these techniques worked, and there’s no doubt at all that we can (if we want to) carry them much further than was possible in the past. And of course, in the recent history of brainwashing—both as applied to prisoners of war and to the lower personnel within the communist party in China—we see that the Pavlovian methods have been applied systematically and evidently with extraordinary efficacy. I mean, I think there can be no doubt that, by the application of these methods, a very large army of totally devoted people has been created. The conditioning has been driven in, so to say, by a kind of psychological iontophoresis into the very depths of the people’s being, and has got so deep that it’s very difficult for it to ever be rooted out. And these methods, I think, are a real refinement on the older methods of terror, because they combine methods of terror with methods of acceptance; that the person who is subjected to a form of terroristic stress, but for the purpose of inducing a kind of “voluntary” acceptance of the psychological state in which he has been driven and the state of affairs within which he finds himself. So there, as I say, has been a definite improvement, shall we say, even in the techniques of terrorism.\nWell, then we come to the consideration of other techniques, of non-terroristic techniques, for inducing consent and for inducing people to love their servitude. Here—I don’t think I can possibly go into all of them, because I don’t know all of them, but, I mean, I can mention a few of the more obvious methods which can now be used, and which are based upon recent scientific findings.\nFirst of all, there are the methods connected with straight suggestion and hypnosis. I think we know much more about this subject than was known in the past. People, of course, have always known about suggestion, and although they didn’t know the word “hypnosis,” they certainly practiced it in various ways. But we have, I think, a much greater knowledge of the subject than in the past, and we can make use of our knowledge in ways which I think the past was never able to make use of it. For example, one of the things we now know for certain is that there is, of course, an enormous—I mean, this has always been known—a very great difference between individuals in regard to their suggestibility. But we now, I think, know pretty clearly the sort of statistical structure of a population in regard to its suggestibility.\nIt’s very interesting when you look at the findings of different fields. I mean, in the field of hypnosis, in the field of administering placebos, for example, in the field of general suggestion, in states of drowsiness or of light sleep you will find the same sorts of orders of magnitude continually cropping up. You’ll find, for example, that the experienced hypnotist will tell one that the percentage of people who can be hypnotized with the utmost facility, just like that, is about twenty percent, and about a corresponding number at the other end of the scale are very, very difficult or almost impossible to hypnotize. But in between there lies a large mass of people who can, with more or less difficulty, be hypnotized; that they can gradually be (if you work hard enough at it) got into the hypnotic state.\nAnd, in the same way, the same sort of figures crop up again, for example, in relation to the administration of placebos. A big experiment was carried out three, four years ago in the general hospital in Boston on post-operative cases, where several hundred men and women suffering comparable kinds of pain after serious operations were given injections whenever they asked for them, whenever the pain got bad. And the injections fifty percent of the time were of morphine, and fifty percent of the time of distilled water. And about twenty percent of those who went through the experiment, about twenty percent of them got just as much relief from the distilled water as from the morphine. About twenty percent got no relief from the distilled water. And in between were those who got some relief or got relief occasionally. So, yet again, we see the same sort of distribution.\nAnd similarly, with regard to what in Brave New World I called hypnopedia, the sleep teaching, I was talking not long ago to a man who manufactures records which people can listen to during the light part of sleep. I mean, these are records for getting rich, for sexual satisfaction, for confidence in salesmanship, and so on. And he said it’s very interesting that these are records sold on a money-back basis, and he says there is regularly between fifteen and twenty percent of people who write indignantly saying the records don’t work at all, and he sends the money back at once. There are, on the other hand, over twenty percent who write enthusiastically, saying they are much richer, their sexual life is much better, et cetera, et cetera. And these, of course, are the dream clients, and they buy more of these records. And then, in between, are those who complain they’re not get much results, and they have to have letters written to them saying, “Go persist, my dear! Go on and you will get there,” and they generally do get results in the long run.\nWell, as I say, on the basis of this, I think we see quite clearly that the human populations can be categorized according to their suggestibility fairly clearly. I suspect very strongly that this twenty percent is the same in all these cases, and I suspect also that it would not be at all difficult to recognize and very early childhood who are those who are extremely suggestible, and who are those extremely unsuggestible, and who are those who occupy the intermediate space. Quite clearly, if everybody were extremely unsuggestible, organized society would be quite impossible. And if everybody were extremely suggestible, then dictatorship would be absolutely inevitable. I mean, it’s very fortunate that we have people who are moderately suggestible in the majority, and who therefore preserve us from dictatorship, but do permit organized society to be formed. But once given the fact that there are these twenty percent of highly suggestible people, it becomes quite clear that this is a matter of enormous political importance. For example, any demagogue who is able to get hold of a large number of these twenty percent of suggestible people and to organize them is really in a position to overthrow any government in any country.\nAnd I mean, I think this—after all, we’ve had the most incredible example in recent years of what can be done by efficient methods of suggestion and persuasion in the form of Hitler. Anybody who’s read, for example, Bullock’s life of Hitler comes forth from with this horrified admiration for this infernal genius who really understood human weaknesses, I think, almost better than anybody, and who exploited them with all the resources then available. I mean, he knew everything. I mean, for example, he knew intuitively this Pavlovian truth that conditioning installed in a state of stress or fatigue goes much deeper than conditioning installed at other times. This was why all his big speeches were organized at night. He speaks of this quite frankly, of course, in Mein Kampf. He says this was done solely because people are tired at night and therefore much less capable of resisting persuasion than they would be during the day. And in all his techniques he was using he had discovered intuitively, and by trial and error, a great many of the weaknesses which we now know about on a sort of scientific way, I think, much more clearly than he did.\nBut the fact remains that this differential of suggestibility, this susceptibility to hypnosis, I do think is something which has to be considered very carefully in relation to any kind of thought about democratic government. If there are twenty percent of the people who really can be suggested into believing almost anything—as evidently they can be—then we have to take extremely careful steps to prevent the rise of demagogues who will drive them on into extreme positions, and then organize them into very, very dangerous private armies which may overthrow the government.\nThis, as I say, is in this field of pure persuasion. I think we do know much more than we did in the past, and obviously we now have mechanisms for multiplying the demagogue’s voice and image in a quite hallucinatory way. I mean, the television and the radio—Hitler was making enormous use of the radio, he could speak to millions of people simultaneously. This alone creates an enormous gulf between the modern and the ancient demagogue. The ancient demagogue could only appeal to as many people as his voice could reach by the yelling at his utmost. But the modern demagogue can touch literally millions at a time. And, of course, with this multiplication of his image he can produce this kind of hallucinatory effect which is of enormous hypnotic and suggestive importance.\nBut then there are the various other methods one can think of which have, thank heaven, as yet not been used, but which obviously could be used. There is, for example, the pharmacological method. This was one of the things I talked about in Brave New World. I invented a hypothetical drug called soma, which of course could not exist as it stood there, because it was simultaneously a stimulant, a narcotic, and a hallucinogen, which seems unlikely in one substance. But the point is that, if you applied several different substances, you could get almost all these results even now. And the really interesting thing about the new chemical substances, the new mind-changing drugs, is this: that whereas, if you look back into history, it’s clear that man has always had a hankering after mind-changing chemicals. He has always desired to take holidays from himself. But the—and this is the most extraordinary effect of all, is that every naturally occurring stimulant, narcotic, sedative, or hallucinogen was discovered before the dawn of history. I don’t think there is one single one of these naturally occurring ones which modern science has discovered. Modern science has, of course, better ways of extracting the active principles of these drugs, and of course has discovered numerous ways of synthesizing new substances of extreme power. But the actual discovery of these naturally occurring things was made by primitive man goodness knows how many centuries ago.\nThere is, for example, underneath the lake dwellings of the early Neolithic which have been dug up in Switzerland we find poppy-heads, which looks as though people were already using this most ancient and powerful and most dangerous of narcotics, even in the days of the rise of agriculture. So that man was apparently a dope addict before he was a farmer—which is a very, very curious comment on human nature!\nBut the difference, as I say, between the ancient mind-changers, the traditional mind- changers, and these new substances is that they were extremely harmful and the new ones are not. I mean, even the permissible mind-changer—alcohol—is not entirely harmless, as people may have noticed. And the other ones, the non-permissible ones, such as opium and cocaine (opium and all its derivatives), are very harmful indeed. They rapidly produce addiction, and in some cases lead at an extraordinary rate to physical degeneration and death. Whereas these new substances—this is really very extraordinary—that a number of these new mind-changing substances can produce enormous revolutions within the mental side of our being, and yet do almost nothing to the physiological side. I mean, you can have an enormous revolution—for example, with LSD-25, or with the newly synthesized drug psilocybin, which is the active principle of the Mexican sacred mushroom—you can have this enormous mental revolution with no more physiological revolution than you would get from drinking two cocktails. And this is a really most extraordinary effect.\nAnd it is, of course, true that pharmacologists are producing a great many wonder drugs where the cure is almost worse than the disease. Every year, a new edition of medical textbooks contains a longer and longer chapter on what are called iatrogenic diseases—that is to say, diseases caused by doctors. And this is quite true. That many of the wonder drugs are extremely dangerous. I mean, they can produce extraordinary effects, and in critical conditions they should certainly be used. But they should be used with the utmost caution. But there is evidently a whole class of drugs effecting the central nervous system which can produce enormous changes in sedation, in euphoria, in energizing the whole mental process, without doing any perceptible harm to the body. And in this sense this represents, it seems to me, the most extraordinary revolution. In the hands of a dictator, these substances of one kind or the other could be used with, first of all, complete harmlessness, and the result would be that you can imagine a euphoric which would make people thoroughly happy even in the most abominable circumstances. I mean, these things are possible. This is the extraordinary thing. I mean, after all, this has even been true with the crude old drugs.\nI mean, a houseman years ago remarked—a propos of Milton’s Paradise Lost—he says, “And beer does more than Milton can to justify God’s ways to man.” And beer is, of course, an extremely crude drug compared with these ones. And you can certainly say that some of the psychic energizers and the new hallucinants can do incomparably more than Milton and all the Theologians combined could possibly do to make the terrifying mystery of our existence seem more tolerable than it does.\nSo that here, I think, one has an enormous area in which the ultimate revolution could function very well indeed. An area in which a great deal of control could be used not through terror, but through making life seem much more enjoyable than it normally does—enjoyable to the point, whereas I have said before, human beings come to love a state of things by which any reasonable and decent human standard they ought not to love. And this, I think, is perfectly possible.\nWell then, very briefly, let me speak about one of the more recent developments in the sphere of neurology: the implantation of electrodes in the brain. This of course has been done on the large scale in animals, and in a few cases, it’s been done in the cases of the hopelessly insane. And anybody who has watched the behaviour of rats with electrodes planted in different centres must come away from this experience with the most extraordinary doubts about what on Earth is in store for us if ever this is got a hold of by a dictator.\nI saw not long ago some rats in the Magoun’s laboratory at UCLA. There were two sets of them: one with electrodes planted in a pleasure center. And the technique was that they had a bar which they pressed, which turned on a very small current for a short space of time, which had a wire connected with that electrode, and which stimulated this pleasure centre—which was evidently absolutely ecstatic. These rats were pressing the bar 18,000 times a day! Apparently, if you kept them from pressing the bar for a day, they would press the bar 36,000 times on the following day until they fell down in complete exhaustion! And they would neither eat, nor be interested in the opposite sex, and would just go on pressing this bar. Then, the most extraordinary rats were those where the electrode was planted halfway between the pleasure and the pain center, and where evidently the result was a kind of mixture of the most wonderful ecstasy and being on the rack at the same time. And you would see the rat sort of looking at its bar and sort of saying, “To be or not to be, that is the question.” Finally it would approach, and do it, and then go back with this awful—I mean, if I can humanize and anthropomorphize—I mean, he was feeling something terribly mixed. And he would wait for quite a long time before pressing the bar again. But he would always press it again! I mean, this was the extraordinary thing.\nI noticed in the most recent issue of Scientific American there’s a very interesting article on electrodes in the brains of chickens, where the technique is very ingenious: you sink into their brains a little socket with a screw on it, and the electrode then can be screwed deeper and deeper into the brain stem, and you can test at any moment according to the depth (which goes in fractions of a millimetre) of what you’re stimulating. And these creatures are not merely stimulated by wire, they’re fitted with a miniaturized radio receiver weighing less than an ounce, which is attached to them, so that they can be communicated with at a distance. I mean, they can run about in the barnyard, and you can press the button, and this particular area of the brain to which the electrode has been screwed down to will be stimulated. And you will get these fantastic phenomena that a sleepy chicken will suddenly get up and rush about, or an active chicken will suddenly sit down and go to sleep, or a hen will suddenly start sitting as though it were hatching out an egg, or a rooster will start fighting or will suddenly go into a state of extreme depression.\nThe whole picture of the absolute control of the drives is terrifying. And in the few cases in which this has been done with very sick human beings, the effects are evidently very remarkable too. I was talking last summer in England to Grey Walter—who is the most eminent exponent of the electroencephalogram technique in England—and he was telling me that he’s seen hopeless inmates at asylums with these things in their heads, and these people were suffering from uncontrollable depression. And they had these electrodes inserted into something resembling, evidently, the pleasure centre of the rat. Anyhow, when they felt too bad, they just pressed a button on the battery in their pocket, and he said the result was fantastic. The mouth was pointing down, would suddenly turn up, and they would evidently feel—I don’t know for how long at a time—very cheerful and happy. So here, again, one sees the most extraordinary revolutionary techniques which are now available to us.\nNow, I think what is obviously perfectly clear is that, for the present, these techniques are not being much used except in a purely experimental way. But I think it is extraordinarily important for us to realize what is happening, to make ourselves acquainted with what has already happened, and then to use a certain amount of imagination to extrapolate into the future the sort of things that might happen. I mean, what might happen if these fantastically powerful techniques were used by unscrupulous people in authority? What on Earth would happen? What sort of society would we get?\nAnd I think this is peculiarly important, because as one sees when looking back over history, we have allowed in the past all those advances in technology—which have profoundly changed our social and individual life—we have allowed them to take us by surprise. I mean, it seems to me that, during the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, when the new machines were making possible the factory system, it was not beyond the wit of man to look at what was happening, and to project into the future, and maybe to forestall the really dreadful consequences which plagued England and most of western Europe and most of this country for about sixty or seventy years.\nThe horrible abuses of the factory system. And if a certain amount of forethought had been devoted to the problem at that time, if people had first of all found out what was happening, and then used their imagination to see what might happen, and then had gone on to work out means by which the worst applications of the new techniques would not take place, then I think western humanity might have been spared about three generations of utter misery which was imposed on the poor at that time.\nAnd similarly with various technological advances now. I mean, it’s quite clear we have to start thinking very, very hard about the problems of automation. And again, I think we have to think still more profoundly about the problems which may arise in relation to these new techniques which may contribute to this ultimate revolution. Our business is to, first of all, as I say, to be aware of what is happening, then to use our imaginations to see what might happen, how this might be abused, and then if possible, to see that the enormous powers which we now possess thanks to these scientific and technological advances shall be used for the benefit of human beings and not for their ultimate degradation.\nThank you.\nDuring his speech, Aldus Huxley refers to the ‘Pavlovian conditioning’ which is to some degree, a form of manipulative control that we are all subjected to in the modern day, in one form or another.\nThe term “Pavlovian” refers to something related to or reminiscent of the experiments and theories associated with Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist and psychologist. Ivan Pavlov conducted influential research on classical conditioning, which involves associating a neutral stimulus with a reflexive response.\nIn Pavlov’s experiments, he conditioned dogs to associate the sound of a bell with the presentation of food. Initially, the bell (neutral stimulus) did not elicit any response from the dogs. However, by repeatedly pairing the bell with the food, Pavlov observed that the dogs began to salivate (reflexive response) in anticipation of the food whenever they heard the bell. This demonstrated the process of classical conditioning, where a previously neutral stimulus gains the ability to elicit a response through association.\nWhen something is described as “Pavlovian,” it typically means it relates to this classical conditioning process. It suggests that a certain stimulus or situation triggers an automatic, reflexive response or behaviour due to conditioning or learned associations. This term is often used to describe behaviours or reactions that are automatic, involuntary, and driven by previous experiences or associations.\n“I would rather lie face down on the ground and use my body as a bridge, than stand proud and tall and use my body as a wall.”\n― Kamand Kojouri",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-truth-about-the-climate-nature-bill/content_1162.html": "The truth about the climate & nature bill\nGroundbreaking Climate and Nature Bill Introduced in UK Parliament\nThis is what they want us to believe:\nA landmark piece of legislation, the Climate and Nature Bill, has been introduced to Parliament, presenting an ambitious framework to address both the climate crisis and biodiversity loss in a coordinated approach. The bill, presented by Alex Sobel MP with cross-party support, sets forth comprehensive measures to ensure the United Kingdom meets crucial climate and nature targets while establishing new mechanisms for public involvement and oversight.\nKey Climate Objectives\nAt the heart of the bill lies a fundamental duty for the Secretary of State to ensure the UK reduces its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. This reduction must align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The legislation emphasises the UK’s obligations under both the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, while acknowledging the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” among nations.\nNature Recovery Targets\nThe bill breaks new ground by requiring the UK to halt and reverse its contribution to nature degradation both domestically and overseas. A key target mandates that by 2030, measured against a 2020 baseline, nature must be demonstrably on the path to recovery. This includes improving the health, abundance, diversity, and resilience of species, populations, habitats, and ecosystems. The legislation aligns with international commitments under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\nStrategy Development and Implementation\nWithin 12 months of the Act’s passing, the Secretary of State must publish and present to Parliament a comprehensive strategy to achieve these objectives. This strategy must include:\n– Annual interim targets\n– Measures to limit the UK’s total carbon dioxide emissions to its fair share of the remaining global carbon budget\n– Comparable reductions in emissions from imported goods and services\n– The rapid phase-out of fossil fuel exploration, extraction, export, and import\n– Ecosystem restoration and enhancement both in the UK and overseas\n– Implementation of the Mitigation and Conservation Hierarchy in all activities affecting nature\n– Steps to address adverse impacts of UK consumption and trade on ecosystems worldwide\nPublic Engagement Through Climate and Nature Assembly\nA notable innovation in the bill is the establishment of a Climate and Nature Assembly, comprising a representative sample of the UK population. Within three months of the Act’s passing, an independent body must be appointed through open tender to establish this Assembly. The Assembly will consider expert advice and make recommendations for the strategy, with any proposals receiving 66% or more support from Assembly members being included in the final strategy unless there are exceptional reasons against their implementation.\nOversight and Monitoring\nThe bill assigns significant responsibilities to both the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). These bodies must:\n– Evaluate and monitor strategy implementation\n– Report annually on progress\n– Review Assembly recommendations\n– Propose measures for inclusion in the strategy\n– The CCC specifically must recommend annual emissions budgets for each greenhouse gas across all UK nations\nDevolved Nations’ Involvement\nThe legislation carefully considers the UK’s devolved structure, requiring approval from the Scottish Parliament, Senedd Cymru, and Northern Ireland Assembly for targets and measures affecting devolved matters. Each legislature must pass specific motions agreeing to both the targets and strategic measures within their competence.\nFinancial Provisions and Implementation\nThe bill ensures financial support through Parliament for all expenditure incurred under the Act. Importantly, it mandates that the strategy must have a positive impact on:\n– Local communities with high deprivation ratings\n– Young people\n– People with protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010\n– Workers affected by the transition, including financial support and retrainingMonitoring and Revision\nAnnual reporting to Parliament is required on strategy implementation and progress toward objectives. If at any point the Secretary of State, CCC, JNCC, or House of Commons determines that the measures are unlikely to achieve the objectives based on current scientific evidence, the strategy must be revised or a statement explaining why revision isn’t necessary must be presented to Parliament.\nCross-Party Support\nThe bill has garnered significant cross-party backing, with supporters including Caroline Lucas, Ed Davey, Colum Eastwood, Brendan O’Hara, Olivia Blake, Sir Peter Bottomley, Daisy Cooper, Clive Lewis, Stephen Farry, Alison Thewliss, and Derek Thomas, demonstrating broad political support for urgent action on climate change and nature recovery.\nThis comprehensive legislation represents a significant step forward in the UK’s approach to addressing environmental challenges, combining ambitious targets with practical implementation measures and strong oversight mechanisms. If passed, it would establish one of the most robust frameworks globally for coordinated action on climate change and biodiversity loss.\nSummary\n**Main Objectives:**\n* Requires the UK to achieve specific climate and nature targets\n* Establishes mandatory duties for the Secretary of State\n* Creates a new Climate and Nature Assembly\n* Sets up oversight roles for key environmental committees\n**Key Climate Requirements:**\n* Reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero\n* Align with 1.5°C global temperature rise limit\n* Meet obligations under UNFCCC and Paris Agreement\n* Limit UK’s total emissions to its fair share of global carbon budget\n**Nature Recovery Goals:**\n* Halt and reverse nature degradation by 2030 (against 2020 baseline)\n* Increase health, abundance, diversity, and resilience of species\n* Fulfill commitments under UN Convention on Biological Diversity\n* Follow Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\n**Strategy Implementation:**\n* Secretary of State must publish strategy within 12 months\n* Include annual interim targets\n* Phase out fossil fuel exploration and extraction\n* Restore and expand natural ecosystems\n* Minimize damage to ecosystems from emissions mitigation\n* Address impacts of UK consumption and trade globally\n**Public Involvement:**\n* Establish Climate and Nature Assembly within 3 months\n* Assembly to comprise representative sample of UK population\n* Consider expert advice and publish recommendations\n* Recommendations with 66% support must be included in strategy\n**Oversight Mechanisms:**\n* Committee on Climate Change and Joint Nature Conservation Committee to:\n* Monitor implementation\n* Report annually on progress\n* Review Assembly recommendations\n* Recommend emissions budgets\n**Devolved Nations:**\n* Requires approval from Scottish Parliament, Senedd Cymru, and Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Specific motions needed for targets affecting devolved matters\n* Strategy must respect devolved legislative competence\n**Social Impact Requirements:**\n* Must positively impact deprived communities\n* Support young people\n* Protect those with protected characteristics\n* Provide financial support and retraining for affected workers\n**Implementation and Review:**\n* Annual reporting to Parliament required\n* Regular strategy revision based on scientific evidence\n* Financial provisions through Parliamentary funding\n* Immediate commencement upon passing\nWhat this bill really means\nOver the past few hours, we have shown exactly how this Bill will destroy our society:\n- Farming and Rural Communities:\nForced rewilding and skyrocketing costs will drive farmers off their land, collapsing food production and rural economies.\n- Energy Costs:\nThe forced end of fossil fuels will push energy prices through the roof, leaving families in the cold and businesses shutting down.\n- Travel and Freedom:\nAffordable holidays and everyday travel will become luxuries, while restrictions and taxes make personal mobility impossible for many.\n- Property Rights:\nHomeowners and farmers will lose control of their land and homes under vague “conservation” and “sustainability” goals.\n- Economic Suicide: While the UK tears itself apart with these policies, countries like China and India will dominate, leaving us weak and dependent.\nRead the Bill here: https://zerohour.uk/downloads/climate-and-nature-bill.pdf\nThis Bill is not about protecting the environment—it is about imposing control, crippling our economy, and punishing ordinary people while achieving nothing for the planet.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-borders-of-israel-under-international-law/content_710.html": "The borders of Israel under international law\nMore than 75 years after Israel declared statehood, its borders are yet to be entirely settled. Wars, treaties and occupation mean the shape of the Jewish state has changed over time, and in parts is still undefined. Here is a series of maps explaining why.\nThe land which would become Israel was for centuries part of the Turkish-ruled Ottoman Empire. After World War One and the collapse of the empire, territory known as Palestine – the portion of which west of the River Jordan was also known as the land of Israel by Jews – was marked out and assigned to Britain to administer by the victorious allied powers (soon after endorsed by the League of Nations).\nThe terms of the mandate entrusted Britain with establishing in Palestine “a national home for the Jewish people”, so long as doing so did not prejudice the civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities there\nThe rise of Palestinian Arab nationalism coupled with the rapid growth of Palestine’s smaller Jewish population – especially after the advent of Nazism in the 1930s – saw an escalation in Arab-Jewish violence in Palestine.\nBritain handed the problem to the United Nations, which in 1947 proposed partitioning Palestine into two states – one Jewish, one Arab – with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area to become an international city. The plan was accepted by Palestine’s Jewish leadership but rejected by Arab leaders.\nThe Jewish leadership in Palestine declared the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the moment the British mandate terminated, though without announcing its borders.\nThe following day Israel was invaded by five Arab armies, marking the start of Israel’s War of Independence. The fighting ended in 1949 with a series of ceasefires, producing armistice lines along Israel’s frontiers with neighbouring states, and creating the boundaries of what became known as the Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt) and East Jerusalem and the West Bank (occupied by Jordan).\nThe surrounding Arab states refused to recognise Israel, meaning its borders remained unset.\nThe biggest change to Israel’s frontiers came in 1967, when the conflict known as the Six Day War left Israel in occupation of the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and most of the Syrian Golan Heights – effectively tripling the size of territory under Israel’s control. Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem – claiming the whole of the city as its capital – and the Golan Heights.\nThese moves were not recognised by the international community, until the US changed its official position on the matter under the Trump administration, becoming the first major power to do so. Overwhelmingly, international opinion continues to consider East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as occupied territory.\nOne of Israel’s land borders was formalised for the first time in 1979, when Egypt became the first Arab country to recognise the Jewish state. Under the treaty, Israel’s border with Egypt was set and Israel withdrew all its forces and settlers from the Sinai, a process which was completed in 1982.\nThat left Israel in occupation of the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, with its frontiers (excluding that of Egypt) still delineated by the 1949 armistice lines.\nIn 1994, Jordan became the second Arab state to recognise Israel, formalising its long border with the Jewish state in the process. While there has not yet been a peace treaty between Israel and Lebanon, the two countries’ 1949 armistice line serves as Israel’s de facto northern border, while Israel’s border with Syria remains unsettled.\nSimilarly, Israel has had a de facto border with Gaza since it pulled its troops and settlers out in 2005, but Gaza and the West Bank are considered a single occupied entity by the UN, and the official borders have not yet been determined.\nThe final status and contours of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem are meant to be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians living there under Israeli occupation, but decades of on-off talks have so far proved fruitless.\nThe border around the Gaza Strip has grown into a semi-permanent structure with security fences and concrete walls set deep into the ground to prevent tunnelling – after Hamas militants launched a series of raids from tunnels into Israel in 2014. However, Hamas militants again breached the security barriers above ground in the biggest attack of its kind on 7 October, 2023.\nEditorial Comment:\nThe British media has lead us to believe for decades, that Israel is somehow ethnically cleansing people within its internationally recognised legal borders, however the reality is quite different. Under international law, the state of Israel, includes the West Bank as well as Gaza, it is the hostility of the Palestinians that has lead to so much division, as they will never be satisfied until they see the end of Israel, this is not a border dispute, it is little more than historical hate on a grand scale.\nIsrael was never under any legal obligation to accept a two-state solution, even though it did, but that was not good enough for the Palestinians, who have waged a war of terror ever since. Israel now faces its greatest dilemma since the six-day war, do they capitulate, do they accept an uneasy ceasefire, which would only serve to allow Hamas to regroup, or do they enforce their legal borders and secure their nation? This is a very difficult decision, but one that nations who support democracy and the rule of law would have no choice but to support, despite their pandering to the left,\nNo matter what Israel decides to do, they have a burden of responsibility to their people, to their nation and to the rule of law, under the uti possidetis juris principle, no country can change the borders of another through aggression and Israel was founded, or rather re-founded according the uti possidetis juris principle, as were Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine and many other former Soviet Block nations.\nOne of the greatest ironies of all, is that Pakistan, a nation that revels in hate for Israel, was not founded under the uti possidetis juris principle, it never previously existed, nor was there previously a state of Pakistan, it was simply an area of land carved out of India, which legally CONTRADICTS the uti possidetis juris principle.\nLet that sink in.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_british-woman-who-claimed-gang-rape-remanded/content_284.html": "A British woman, 19, was escorted to Famagusta district court by police on Tuesday, where she was remanded until August 7 for alleging she was gang-raped by 12 Israeli tourists almost two weeks ago. She arrived at the courthouse with her head covered at approximately 9 am, escorted by police. She had been detained overnight following a court hearing on Monday that was ultimately postponed for 24 hours due to the absence of her lawyer.\nThe woman, who alleged almost two weeks ago that she was gang-raped by 12 Israelis, is facing charges of public mischief after she reportedly confessed under questioning that her encounter with the teenagers was consensual. Their ages range from 15 to 18. According to information, the 19-year-old reportedly admitted that she had consensual sex with some of the Israeli teens but when she realised that others were recording on their cell phones, it angered her and she allegedly decided to get back at them by saying she was raped.\nCOMMENT\nIt is now becoming clear that this was a ridiculous allegation made by a very irresponsible and spiteful girl. What has surprised me is the number of people who have been making wild conspiracy allegations, based on information via the media. I hope that she will be prosecuted, to the full extent of the law for this, because her actions might just discourage a genuine victim to file a complaint, or discredit the law, placing women at risk.\nIt is hard enough to get a conviction for rape as it is and in a Europe where rape has increased dramatically, this makes the actions of this girl, all the more offensive. It appears that this case has also raised a lot of questions that we as a society must address, or risk falling further in to a moral abyss.\nWe know from the the constant stream of sinister events that the act of taking videos of other people’s suffering to whatever degree has got out of hand, What began years ago with ‘Happy Slapping’ has in recent years taken a vile and sinister turn on the slippery slope to where we are today.\nWhere young ladies are concerned, we must question if the social pressure for women to feel that it is acceptable for them to behave without any moral conscience, but at the same time, possibly as a result of the way many young women behave, along with free access to pornography when they are young and impressionable, too many young men have stopped treating women with the respect that they deserve and that is not something that a civilised society should overlook.\nThey took video of the girl in an intimate situation and posted it online, yet they were not charged with anything!\nThere is no doubt that filming this young lady was a gross act of disrespect, but everything moves incrementally, how many of us watch clips of people taken in embarrassing situations? although this may have been taken to a completely different level, it still begs the question that all of us should ask ourselves, and that is if we directly or indirectly condone the mindset of being entertained by the suffering or humiliation of others? If we accept the notion that we do, then we must also accept that this was a sinister evolution of something that we all passively allow.\nIn the meantime, it was not right for the boys to have filmed her, it is unclear why that they were not charged with that, but that does not mean that they should be charged with rape. There has been a shocking increase in youngsters taking videos of obscene actions, even stabbings in London, that is disgraceful of course, but there there is a lot of immorality that is not illegal.\nAs I have said before, rape convictions are ridiculously low as it is, I fear that somewhere, somehow, a genuine victim will not get justice because of this, either for fear of being ridiculed or because so many people have come to their own conclusion that these young men were guilty and somehow they were freed because of a back door deal, which also sends out a message that it is possible to get away with rape. Perhaps there should be less information released to the public until the full facts are gathered, but that in itself opens the door to further corruption behind the scenes, so it remains a very challenging fine line.\nPeople have been taken to court and fined for appearing in people’s photographs that they have posted on Facebook, which is not actually the law, but an abuse of the law. As it stands, throughout Europe, the filming of anything or anyone in public is legal, including anything visible from a public place, unless you pursue people to photograph them, then that is harassment.\nHowever, anything taken on private property must have the permission of the owner, hence the reason that photography is not allowed in the Cyprus Mall.\nIn this case, according to the law, they were on private property, but it depends on the way the law interprets consent for filming. I would have thought that at the very least, there would have been grounds for a case against the young men who posted the video, either under privacy laws or under the ‘revenge porn’ laws.\nAs it stands, the Cypriot authorities have made a statement that it is not an offence to do this and that is not acceptable.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-complex-history-of-un-resolution-242-and-jerusalem/content_438.html": "The Complex History of UN Resolution 242 and Jerusalem\nThe status of Jerusalem has been fiercely disputed since Israel gained control of East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Six Day War. UN Security Council Resolution 242, passed in November 1967, has been interpreted and argued over by Israelis and Palestinians when it comes to determining Jerusalem’s rightful status. Here’s a comprehensive look at this convoluted history and the murky legal standing of UN resolutions regarding Jerusalem.\nAfter the Shocking 1967 War, Israel Controlled a United Jerusalem\nThe 1967 Six Day War was brief but profoundly impacted the region. Israel inflicted a crushing defeat on surrounding Arab nations who had vowed to destroy the fledgling Jewish state. By the end of the fighting, Israel had gained control of the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.\nOvernight, Israel found itself in control of three times more territory than before the war. This included the entire city of Jerusalem, as Israel captured East Jerusalem and the Old City from Jordanian forces. At the time, Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem were not under Palestinian control or part of any Palestinian state. The West Bank had been annexed by Jordan in 1948 after the first Arab-Israeli war.\nAfter the war, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol stated Israel would be willing to withdraw from much of the newly gained land. However, this was conditional on finally achieving recognition, direct negotiations and peace treaties with neighbouring Arab states who had long vowed to destroy Israel.\nUnfortunately, Arab leaders rebuffed these peace overtures. At the Khartoum Resolution of 1967, just months after their defeat, Arab leaders stubbornly refused to negotiate with, recognize or make peace with Israel.\nVaguely Worded Resolution 242 Called for Withdrawal from Some Territories\nTwo months after the Arab League’s refusal to engage in peace talks at Khartoum, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 242 in November 1967. This called for:\n– Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from unspecified “territories occupied” in the recent conflict\n– Termination of all claims or states of belligerency\n– Acknowledgement of sovereignty for every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries\nThe resolution was intentionally vague about which territories Israel should withdraw from and how much. It refers only to withdrawal from “territories” rather than “all the territories” or “the territories.” This wording was insisted upon by the British drafters of the resolution.\nThe resolution did not even mention Palestinians, as they were not considered a distinct third party in the conflict at the time. Instead it focused on protocols and principles for achieving peace treaties between Israel and neighbouring Arab states who had attempted to destroy Israel in 1967 despite its pre-war appeals for neutrality.\nIsrael Utilized 242 in Land-for-Peace Deals with Egypt and Jordan\nIn 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made a daring and unprecedented visit to Jerusalem to speak in the Israeli Knesset. This historic gesture by an Arab leader led to the Camp David Accords in 1978, mediated by US President Jimmy Carter. Israel agreed to withdraw troops and settlements from the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for a full peace treaty with Egypt.\nSimilarly, in 1994 Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan under the framework of Resolution 242. As part of this, Jordan gave up claims to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in favor of Palestinian control. However, its annexation of the West Bank after 1948 had been illegal, so Jordan’s relinquishing of these territories was on shaky legal grounds too.\nTo date, Israel has withdrawn from over 95% of the land it gained control of in 1967, including the vast Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, parts of the Golan Heights and portions of the West Bank. However, it has not received the reciprocal peace, recognition and secure borders that 242 envisioned from Arab states.\nIsrael Claims Pre-Existing Historical Rights to a United Jerusalem\nToday, many dispute Israel’s continued control over East Jerusalem and argue for withdrawal. However, Israel maintains it is simply reconstituting the geographically united and Jewish-controlled Jerusalem that existed prior to 1948. Israel argues it has not relinquished these pre-existing historical rights.\nIn 1980, the Israeli Knesset passed a Basic Law re-stating that united Jerusalem was Israel’s eternal, undivided capital. At the time, this outraged much of the international community who saw it as an alteration of Jerusalem’s recent status.\nHowever, Israel contended it was not creating any new claim or rights over Jerusalem, but merely re-affirming long-held historical rights that pre-dated the 1948 war which had forcibly divided the city.\nNon-Binding UN Resolution 478 Condemned Israel’s Assertion of Rights\nIn direct response to Israel’s Basic Law asserting long-held rights in Jerusalem, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 478 in 1980. Among other measures, the resolution:\n– Strongly censured and condemned the Basic Law as a violation of international law\n– Stated the Knesset was attempting to unlawfully alter the character and status of Jerusalem\n– Called upon nations with embassies in Jerusalem to withdraw them from the city\nThe resolution passed with 14 Security Council members in favor and only the United States abstaining. However, the US still maintained the resolution was flawed and disagreed with its conclusions.\nIn response to the resolution, the last 13 countries reluctantly withdrew their embassies from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv so as not to incur backlash from Arab nations. However, other countries like the UK maintained consulates in the city.\nUN Resolutions Have No Binding Legal Authority\nThis raises the critical point that UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions are political statements and stances, but generally carry no legally binding authority under international law, despite frequent public misconceptions.\nResolution 478 was passed under Chapter 6 rather than Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. This means it is only a non-binding recommendation. Chapter 7 enables legally binding resolutions, but requires unanimous agreement of the Security Council, which was not achieved here.\nTherefore, Israel maintains that Resolution 478 has no legal power to alter the status of Jerusalem or negate Israel’s pre-existing historical rights and claims to the city under international law – regardless of the resolution’s political condemnation.\nWhat Does This Complex History Mean for Jerusalem’s Status?\nIn summary, while Resolution 478 politically disputed Israel’s stance on Jerusalem, Israel argues it does not supersede Israel’s historical legal rights to an undivided Jerusalem that pre-date both the 1948 and 1967 wars.\nThis complex interplay between disputed but non-binding UN resolutions, controversial Israeli Basic Laws and Israel’s insistence on pre-existing rights make determining Jerusalem’s true legal status no simple task. The debate rages on, but the history provides essential context.\n– After the 1967 war, Israel controlled a united Jerusalem for the first time since 1948\n– UN Resolution 242 called for Israeli withdrawal from some occupied territories, but was intentionally vague\n– Israel utilized 242 in land-for-peace deals with Egypt and Jordan, withdrawing from Sinai and the West Bank\n– Israel claims pre-existing historical rights to Jerusalem based on Jewish control before 1948\n– Israel’s 1980 Basic Law declared united Jerusalem as the eternal capital\n– UN Resolution 478 condemned this as altering Jerusalem’s status, but was non-binding\n– UN resolutions are political statements, not legally binding sources of international law\n– Israel maintains 242 and 478 do not negate its historical legal rights in Jerusalem\n– The complex history fuels ongoing debate about Jerusalem’s disputed status\n– There are reasonable historical and legal arguments on both sides\n– Final status negotiations would be required to resolve the complex issues\n– For now, the dispute continues, with Israel in de facto control of West and East Jerusalem",

Rumours circulating within Westminster suggest that Miliband’s political influence is waning, with growing frustration among his Labour colleagues regarding his unwavering commitment to environmental policies.\nEnvironmental Ideology under Scrutiny\nMiliband has become increasingly identified with a stringent environmental agenda that appears to be creating friction within the Labour Party. His colleagues reportedly view his approach as potentially detrimental to economic growth, with concerns that his green initiatives might be hampering the party’s broader strategic objectives.\nThe tensions seem particularly acute around issues of industrial development and military modernisation. For instance, Miliband’s apparent advocacy for electric tanks has been met with significant scepticism. Military experts question the practical feasibility of electrifying heavy military equipment, pointing to the substantial weight and operational requirements of modern battle tanks.\nMilitary Modernisation Debate\nThe discussion around military technology highlights the complex challenge of balancing environmental considerations with practical defence needs. While Miliband appears committed to reducing carbon emissions across all sectors, including defence, his proposals have been characterised by some as idealistic and potentially unrealistic.\nThe current Challenger tank, widely regarded as one of the world’s most advanced armoured vehicles, relies on a robust diesel engine. The suggestion of electrifying such equipment raises technical questions about power, range, and battlefield effectiveness that seem to challenge the very principles of military engineering.\nCabinet Dynamics\nWhispers from Westminster suggest that Rachel Reeves, a key figure in the Labour leadership, may be distancing herself from Miliband. The rumoured tension implies a potential strategic realignment within the party, with Miliband’s environmental stance potentially being viewed as a liability rather than an asset.\nPersonal and Political Trajectory\nMiliband’s political journey appears to be at a critical juncture. Once seen as a passionate advocate for environmental policy, he now faces potential marginalisation within his own party. The narrative emerging suggests a politician potentially out of step with the pragmatic needs of contemporary political strategy.\nPotential Outcomes\nSpeculation is rife that Miliband might be repositioned within the political landscape. Some suggest he could be elevated to the House of Lords, a traditional pathway for politicians transitioning from frontline roles. This would effectively remove him from direct cabinet influence while providing a face-saving exit strategy.\nBroader Implications\nThe potential departure of Miliband represents more than just an individual political transition. It symbolises the ongoing tension within progressive politics between ideological purity and practical governance. The Labour Party appears to be navigating a delicate balance between maintaining its environmental credentials and addressing economic growth concerns.\nThe Challenge of Green Policy\nMiliband’s experience underscores the complex challenge of implementing comprehensive environmental policies. While the intent to drive sustainable change is laudable, political effectiveness requires nuanced implementation that can garner broader support.\nConclusion\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve, Ed Miliband’s current position seems increasingly precarious. The coming weeks may prove pivotal in determining his political future and the Labour Party’s approach to environmental policy.\nThe unfolding narrative suggests a potential recalibration of the party’s environmental strategy, balancing ambitious green goals with pragmatic economic and industrial considerations.\nThe removal of this delusional fanatic from government could not come soon enough, left to him, our country would be bankrupt, our industry long-gone and our homes will be cold…………..GOODBYE!",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-the-kitos-war/content_91.html": "The Kitos War or The Jewish Revolt as it has come to be known as (115–117; Hebrew: מרד הגלויות: mered ha’galuyot or mered ha’tfutzot [מרד התפוצות]; translation: rebellion of the diaspora. Latin: Tumultus Iudaicus) was one of the major Jewish–Roman wars, 66–136. The rebellions erupted in the year 115, when majority of the Roman armies were fighting Trajan’s Parthian War on the eastern border of the Roman Empire, major uprisings by ethnic Judeans in Cyrenaica, Cyprus and Egypt spiralled out of control, resulting in a widespread slaughter of left-behind Roman garrisons and Roman citizens by Jewish rebels.\nThe Jewish rebellions were finally crushed by Roman legionary forces, chiefly by the Roman general Lusius Quietus, whose nomen later gave the conflict its title, as “Kitos” is a later corruption of Quietus. Some were left so utterly annihilated that Romans moved in to settle these areas to prevent their complete depopulation. The Jewish leader, Lukuas, fled to Judea. Marcius Turbo pursued him and sentenced to death the brothers Julian and Pappus, who had been key leaders in the rebellion. Lusius Quietus, the conqueror of the Jews of Mesopotamia, was now in command of the Roman army in Judea, and laid siege to Lydda, where the rebel Jews had gathered under the leadership of Julian and Pappus. Lydda was next taken and many of the rebellious Jews were executed; the “slain of Lydda” are often mentioned in words of reverential praise in the Talmud. The rebel leaders Pappus and Julian were among those executed by the Romans in the same year. The situation in Judea remained tense for the Romans, who were obliged under Hadrian to permanently move the Legio VI Ferrata into Caesarea Maritima in Judea.\nBackground\nThe First Jewish–Roman War\nTension between the Jewish population of the Roman Empire and the Greek and Roman populations mounted over the course of the 1st century CE, gradually escalating with various violent events, mainly throughout Judea (Iudaea), where parts of the Judean population occasionally erupted into violent insurrections against the Roman Empire. Several incidents also occurred in other parts of the Empire, most notably the Alexandria pogroms, targeting the large Jewish community of Alexandria in the province of Egypt. However, with the exception of Alexandria, the Jewish diaspora fared well throughout the Roman Empire and relied on the Roman state for maintaining their rights.\nThe escalation of tensions finally erupted as the First Jewish–Roman War, which began in the year 66 AD. Initial hostilities were due to Greek and Jewish religious tensions, but later escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens. The Roman military garrison of Judea was quickly overrun by rebels and the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II fled Jerusalem, together with Roman officials, to Galilee. Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, brought the Syrian army, based on XII Fulminata, reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order and quell the revolt. The legion, however, was ambushed and defeated by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon, a result that shocked the Roman leadership.\nThe suppression of the revolt was then handed to General Vespasian and his son Titus, who assembled four legions and began advancing through the country, starting with Galilee, in the year 67 CE. The revolt ended when legions under Titus besieged and destroyed the centre of rebel resistance in Jerusalem in the year 70 CE, and defeated the remaining Jewish strongholds later on.\nRevolt and warfare\nIn 115, the emperor Trajan was in command of the eastern campaign against the Parthian Empire. The Roman invasion had been prompted by the imposition of a pro-Parthian king on the throne of Armenia after a Parthian invasion of that land. This encroachment on the traditional sphere of influence of the Roman Empire — the two empires had shared hegemony over Armenia since the time of Nero some 50 years earlier — could only lead to war.\nThe Cypriot Jews participated in the great uprising against the Romans under Trajan in 117 AD, and massacred 240,000 Greeks.\nAs Trajan’s army advanced victoriously through Mesopotamia, Jewish rebels in its rear began attacking the small garrisons left behind. A revolt in far off Cyrenaica soon spread to Egypt and then Cyprus, inciting revolt in Judea. A widespread uprising centred at Lydda threatened grain supplies from Egypt to the front. The Jewish insurrection swiftly spread to the recently conquered provinces. Cities with substantial Jewish populations – Nisibis, Edessa, Seleucia, Arbela – joined the rebellion and slaughtered their small Roman garrisons.\nCyrenaica\nIn Cyrenaica, the rebels were led by one Lukuas or Andreas, who called himself “king” (according to Eusebius of Caesarea). His group destroyed many temples, including those to Hecate, Jupiter, Apollo, Artemis, and Isis, as well as the civil structures that were symbols of Rome, including the Caesareum, the basilica, and the public baths.\nThe 4th century Christian historian Orosius records that the violence so depopulated the province of Cyrenaica that new colonies had to be established by Hadrian:\n“The Jews … waged war on the inhabitants throughout Libya in the most savage fashion, and to such an extent was the country wasted that, its cultivators having been slain, its land would have remained utterly depopulated, had not the Emperor Hadrian gathered settlers from other places and sent them thither, for the inhabitants had been wiped out.”\nDio Cassius states of Jewish insurrectionaries:\n“‘Meanwhile the Jews in the region of Cyrene had put one Andreas at their head and were destroying both the Romans and the Greeks. They would cook their flesh, make belts for themselves of their entrails, anoint themselves with their blood, and wear their skins for clothing. Many they sawed in two, from the head downwards. Others they would give to wild beasts and force still others to fight as gladiators. In all, consequently, two hundred and twenty thousand perished. In Egypt, also, they performed many similar deeds, and in Cyprus under the leadership of Artemio. There, likewise, two hundred and forty thousand perished. For this reason no Jew may set foot in that land, but even if one of them is driven upon the island by force of the wind, he is put to death. Various persons took part in subduing these Jews, one being Lusius, who was sent by Trajan.”\nThe original 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia cited this about the Cyrene massacres:\n“By this outbreak Libya was depopulated to such an extent that a few years later new colonies had to be established there (Eusebius, “Chronicle” from the Armenian, fourteenth year of Hadrian). Bishop Synesius, a native of Cyrene in the beginning of the fifth century, speaks of the devastations wrought by the Jews.”\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia acknowledges Dio Cassius’s importance as a source, though believes his accounts of the actions at Cyrene and on Cyprus may have been embellished:\n“For an account of the Jewish war under Trajan and Hadrian Dion is the most important source (lxviii. 32, lxix. 12–14), though his descriptions of the cruelties perpetrated by the Jews at Cyrene and on the island of Cyprus are probably exaggerated.”\nEgypt\nLukuas led the rebels toward Alexandria, entered the city, which had been abandoned by the Roman governor, Marcus Rutilius Lupus, and set fire to it. The Egyptian temples and the tomb of Pompey were destroyed. Jewish rebels reportedly also prevailed in a battle at Hermopolis in 116, as indicated in a papyrus.Trajan sent new troops under the praefectus praetorio Marcius Turbo, but Egypt and Cyrenaica were pacified only in autumn 117.\nCyprus\nIn Cyprus a Jewish band under a leader named Artemion took control of the island, killing tens of thousands of Cypriot Greek civilians. The Cypriot Jews participated in the great uprising against the Romans under Trajan (117), and massacred 240,000 Greeks. A Roman army was dispatched to the island, soon reconquering the capital. After the revolt had been fully defeated, laws were created forbidding any Jews to live on the island.\n“Such was the bitterness of the people of Cyprus towards the Jews, that a law was passed banning any person of Jewish descent or faith from ever setting foot on Cyprus, under pain of death. This law was still in effect a century later under the Severan emperors, and was even applicable if the offender had been shipwrecked on Cyprus or had been blown to its shores by unforeseen winds.”\nMesopotamia\nA new revolt sprang up in Mesopotamia, while Trajan was in the Persian Gulf. Trajan reconquered Nisibis (Nusaybin in Turkey), Edessa, the capital of Osroene, and Seleucia (Iraq), each of which housed large Jewish communities.\nA pro-Roman son of the Parthian king Osroes I, named Parthamaspatas, had been brought on the expedition as part of the emperor’s entourage. Trajan had him crowned in Ctesiphon as king of the Parthians. Cassius Dio described the event thus: “Trajan, fearing that the Parthians, too, might begin a revolt, desired to give them a king of their own. Accordingly, when he came to Ctesiphon, he called together in a great plain all the Romans and likewise all the Parthians that were there at the time; then he mounted a lofty platform, and after describing in grandiloquent language what he had accomplished, he appointed Parthamaspates king over the Parthians and set the diadem upon his head.” With this done, Trajan moved north to take personal command of the ongoing siege of Hatra.\nThe siege continued throughout the summer of 117, but the years of constant campaigning in the baking eastern heat had taken their toll on Trajan, who suffered a heatstroke. He decided to begin the long journey back to Rome in order to recover. Sailing from Seleucia, the emperor’s health deteriorated rapidly. He was taken ashore at Selinus in Cilicia, where he died, and his successor, Hadrian, assumed the reins of government shortly thereafter.\nJudea\nThe Jewish leader, Lukuas, fled to Judea. Marcius Turbo pursued him and sentenced to death the brothers Julian and Pappus, who had been key leaders in the rebellion. Lusius Quietus, the conqueror of the Jews of Mesopotamia, was now in command of the Roman army in Judea, and laid siege to Lydda, where the rebel Jews had gathered under the leadership of Julian and Pappus. The distress became so great that the patriarch Rabban Gamaliel II, who was shut up there and died soon afterwards, permitted fasting even on Ḥanukkah. Other rabbis condemned this measure. Lydda was next taken and many of the rebellious Jews were executed; the “slain of Lydda” are often mentioned in words of reverential praise in the Talmud. The rebel leaders Pappus and Julian were among those executed by the Romans in the same year.\nLusius Quietus, whom the Emperor Trajan had held in high regard and who had served Rome so well, was quietly stripped of his command once Hadrian had secured the Imperial title. He was murdered in unknown circumstances in the summer of 118, possibly by the orders of Hadrian.\nHadrian took the unpopular decision to end the war, abandoning much of Trajan’s eastern conquests and stabilising the eastern borders. Although he abandoned the erstwhile province of Mesopotamia, he installed Parthamaspates – who had been ejected from Ctesiphon by the returning Osroes – as king of a restored Osroene. For a century Osroene would retain a precarious independence as a buffer state, sandwiched between the two empires.\nThe situation in Judea remained tense for the Romans, who were obliged under Hadrian to permanently move the Legio VI Ferrata into Caesarea Maritima in Judea.\nAftermath\nBar Kokhba revolt\nFurther developments occurred in Judea Province in the year 130, when Emperor Hadrian visited the Eastern Mediterranean and, according to Cassius Dio, made the decision to rebuild the ruined city of Jerusalem as the Roman colonia of Aelia Capitolina, derived from his own name. The decision, together with Hadrian’s other sanctions against the Jews, was allegedly one of the reasons for the eruption of the 132 Bar Kokhba revolt — an extremely violent uprising, which stretched Roman military and resources to the limit. The Bar Kokhba rebellion ended with an unprecedented onslaught of Judean population and a ban upon the Jewish faith across the Roman Empire, which was lifted only in 138, upon Hadrian’s death.\nCOMMENT\nAt this time, the number of fatalities (240,000) within the Greek, or Greek Cypriot people was actually Genocide on a scale never seen before and never seen again to this day.",

Juncker is in Sibiu in Romania where the informal European Council meeting was taking place and where President Nicos Anastasiades was to brief his EU counterparts on the latest developments concerning the presence of the Turkish drillship ‘Fatih’ off Paphos within the Republic’s EEZ.\nAsked by the Cyprus News Agency how the EU was planning on dealing with the matter, Juncker replied: “I am Cypriot.”\nOn arrival at the Sibiu Summit, Anastasiades said he intended to elaborate on what was happening “unfortunately as a result of the violation of international law by Turkey,” expressing hope Cyprus would have the strong support of the European Council and the EU.\n“I hope that something appropriate will be done something that dignifies Europe into the eyes of all Europeans, particularly on the basis of the principles of European solidarity and respect for the sovereignty of the states in general, especially the member states.”\nAnastasiades already informed the heads of parties that are members of the European People’s Party (EPP) whose summit also took place in Sibiu, ahead of the Council meeting, of Turkey’s illegal activities.\nThe president raised the issue of restrictive measures “against all those involved in Turkey’s unlawful actions” in the Republic of Cyprus’ EEZ and the Eastern Mediterranean, reiterating that at “virtually these unacceptable actions amount to a new invasion of Cyprus from Turkey after the tragic events of 1974.”\n“The time has come for a collective response to these challenges with actions beyond the usual messages that have proven ineffective,” he said addressing the EPP summit.\nIt is clear, he said, that all of the EU’s rigorous messages to Turkey have hit a wall.\n“Even the recent statement by EU High Representative (Federica) Mogherini has been met with irony by the Turkish foreign minister,” he said. The ultimate goal of the measures should be “to end Turkey’s unlawful actions that are likely to further destabilise the region.”\nTurkey’s actions, he said, constituted a flagrant violation of Cyprus’ sovereign rights and are contrary to international and European law while her allegations of acting in the best interest of Turkish Cypriots were completely unfounded.\n“It is by far the most serious violation of the sovereign rights of Cyprus and we are faced with an unprecedented escalation of Turkey’s unlawful actions in the Eastern Mediterranean, “he said.\nGovernment Spokesman Prodromos Prodromou said after the summit that the EPP partners condemn Turkish intervention and call on Turkey to abandon these illegal activities which are directed not only against the Republic of Cyprus but also against the EU’s interests.”\n“At the same time, the EPP notes that it will follow the situation closely and respond accordingly, showing solidarity to the Republic of Cyprus,” he said. Later in the day, Britain said it was concerned by Turkey’s intention to begin offshore drilling operations in an area claimed by Cyprus as its exclusive economic zone, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said.\n“Concerned by Turkey’s announcement to begin drilling in Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone,” Hunt said.\n“This situation must be deescalated and all parties show restraint,” he said. “Hydrocarbons development should benefit all Cypriots and support a settlement.”",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cyprus-court-sentences-serial-killer-to-7-life-terms/content_276.html": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A Cyprus criminal court on Monday sentenced an army captain to seven life terms in prison after he pleaded guilty to the premeditated murder and kidnapping of seven foreign women and girls.\nIn handing down the sentence, the three-judge panel said that Nicholas Metaxas appeared to have mounted a “campaign of murder” in choosing defenseless women, most of whom came to Cyprus looking for work.\nThe judges said Metaxas “didn’t even hesitate to kill children” over a 2½-year period during which prosecutors said he sought out many of his adult victims on online social networks using the handle “Orestes35″ and had sex with them. Five life terms will run consecutively, while two will run concurrently. The judges said there could be no mitigating circumstances in such a case.\nEarlier, Metaxas pleaded guilty and tearfully apologised to the families of his victims for the “unjust pain” he has caused them. Reading from a prepared statement, Metaxas said he doesn’t “have any clear answers” why he committed the killings and that he has “struggled” to figure out the “why and how.”\nThe 35-year-old officer said his cooperation with police investigators was the least he could do to ease the pain he caused to the families of the victims and his own family. Metaxas killed four Filipino women and the daughter of one of them, as well as a Nepalese woman and a Romanian mother and her daughter.\nHe asked authorities for a scientific panel to interview him in order to delve into his psyche and find the reasons for his actions in what’s believed to be the east Mediterranean island nation’s first serial killer case. He did speak of unspecified events in his past “decades ago” that he tried to forget.\nHe looked down throughout his court appearance as a state prosecutor said six of the victims died of strangulation and the seventh of a massive head injury. The case came to light on April 14 when the decomposing body of Mary Rose Tiburcio, 38, from the Philippines, was found by chance down a flooded mineshaft that was part of an abandoned copper mine.\nFour days later, the body of 28-year-old Arian Palanas Lozano, also from the Philippines, was pulled out of the same mineshaft. Investigators homed in on Metaxas after scrutinizing the online communications of both women. Metaxas, a divorced father of two children aged 6 and 9, initially refused to cooperate with investigators. But as the evidence increased, he buckled and confessed in a 10-page handwritten note to the seven killings.\nHis victims included Romanian Livia Florentina Bunea, 36, and her 8-year-old daughter Elena Natalia; Maricar Valtez Arquiola, 31, from the Philippines; Ashita Khadka Bista, from Nepal; and Tiburcio’s daughter, Sierra Grace.\nMetaxas led police to where he disposed of his victims’ bodies; the bound remains of Bunea, her daughter and Arquiola were placed in suitcases and thrown into a toxic lake that was part of the same abandoned mine. Bista’s skeletal remains were found down a dry well inside an army firing range. Tiburcio’s daughter was found in another lake, wrapped in a sheet and weighed down by a rock.\nMetaxas had told investigators under questioning that what prompted him to strangle Tiburcio and Bunea was his “hatred” of them and desire for “vengeance” over his suspicions that they prostituted their daughters. He said he choked the children to death as they slept “so that they would no longer have to suffer.”\nProsecutors said investigations found that both mothers were very loving and cared for their children.\nMetaxas also told investigators that he strangled Maricar and Lozano as he climaxed during sex with them. He said he killed Bista, who died of a head injury, in anger after she spat at him for videoing their sexual encounter.\nAll Metaxas’ victims except Bista had been reported missing to police shortly after their disappearanceThe disappearance of Bunea and her daughter in October 2016 was the subject of an investigative report by a local TV reporter, who said police claimed they had good reason to believe that the mother and daughter had crossed into the breakaway north of the ethnically split island.\nPolice failures to probe those missing persons cases resulted in the resignation of the justice minister and the firing of the police chief. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said lives could have been spared had police acted swiftly in investigating those initial reports.\nCOMMENT\nI have grave concerns about this conviction, as this is the first time they have dealt with a case so serious and a psychopath, so evil here in Cyprus. Has this man lead them down his chosen path? His first solicitor resigned, in the interim period, he confessed, they found whatever evidence they had found. He continued to refuse a solicitor, but hard as it may seem to believe, confessions and DNA do not always result in a ‘safe conviction’\nTHIS MONSTER KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE IS DOING\nHe was in court on Monday morning 24th June 2019 and was found guilty and sentenced all in one day. Anyone familiar with the workings of the ECHR will have grave concerns, because it would be a tragedy if there are grounds for an appeal at a later date.\nI have always maintained that for crimes this serious, he should have been assigned the best representation, not so he can be free to walk, but ensure that his conviction is so safe, that he WILL NOT!\nMy deepest sympathies to the families of the victims. There is no possibility of comprehending the mind of a monster.",

And we never, ever said inequality didn’t matter or that tackling it was not a priority of the Government.\n“And by the way, what we did at home, we also did abroad, trebling help to the poorest countries, mobilising the international community in support of action against global poverty and becoming the first major developed nation to hit the 0.7% of GDP aid target.\n“Of course, like any government we had faults, failures and did things people disagreed with.\n“But don’t tell me or those who worked with me or those who were part of the Labour Party at the time, that we did nothing for the poorest in our country or the world. We did and we’re proud of it.”\nTHE VIDEO\nCOMMENT\nThis is just another example of the psychopath that is Blair, interfering in the workings of government. He had obviously sold his soul to the Devil a long time ago and everything he did was about appeasing the political classes, appeasing Europe and doing his part of the Globalisation agenda.\nHe led this country in to a war that was based on lies, DAMNED LIES, he instigated the opening of the floodgates allowing an invasion of immigrants never seen before in history!",

Even now when prices may be falling, by how much well that’s a separate topic, but the affordability is worse than ever, so younger people are unable to get onto the property ladder and whereas in the 70s there were many people who could have paid off their home by their 40s, most people now who are under 30 have no hope of doing that even if they live to be a hundred.\nThat’s the reality of it so they’ve cut the inflow into the property market now we’ve got all those older people who’ve got all of this equity and the government wants to get their hands on it, they don’t want it trickling down to future generations, hence the reason I’d actually mentioned previously, that you should go to ukwealth.tax and look at the government’s discussion on enforcing a one-off tax. Believe it or not, wealth tax this was actually commissioned on under Boris in 2020, so this is not a labour of movement this is not something Jeremy Corbyn dreamed up, this was actually instigated under Boris and they are looking at literally stealing the equity of the wealthy.\nInitially they’re trying to convince us that they’re going to go for just the super rich and we will go oh yes absolutely right but that won’t be the case when it actually happens because most of these wealthy people don’t own the properties in their own names and it they’re not going to go and raid corporations they’re going to raid individuals they want Mr and Mrs Mott who’ve worked hard all of their lives and they own a nice detached property or whatever the case may be and it’s worth one million, two million, five million or whatever the case is, they deserve it they worked for it they started from nothing but the government doesn’t want them to keep it, more importantly they don’t want their children to get hold of it because the direction that we’re going is that the corporations are buying everything and even those of you who are individual landlords, you were encouraged to make sacrifices to buy your buy to let properties in order to help the rental market and then bang, George Osborne comes in with a three percent surcharge.\nThen we had the deregulation act in 2015 then, we had section 24, now capital gains tax, since my last video in the chancellor’s speech it is going to be reduced to six thousand pounds from April 2023 and 3,000 pounds the April following that, who will suffer the most with this reduction? With regards to the capital gains tax allowance, it is a small investor and as I have said previously George Osborne’s calculated stamp Duty surcharge of three percent had the most effect on individual developers who would be buying one or two properties to renovate or develop in whatever the case may, be because surprise surprise, those who can afford to buy six properties in one go or more don’t pay the extra three percent and now with capital gains being reduced the allowance being reduced again it is the small person who is going to suffer the most.\nMore importantly as I’ve said previously, there are hundreds of thousands of properties in this country, that are below par and that is where the chancellor should be directing investors. landlords and individuals to be focusing on buying, renovating and improving our housing stock, but they don’t want you to do that they don’t want you to actually make the effort to buy this housing stock and things are getting worse. They are creating a crisis since my last video we’ve had the immigration figures released so for the last year net migration is over 500 000 excluding those arriving by boat as it stands we would need to build one house every five minutes 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, just to keep up with the new demand let alone to catch up.\nThe government is doing nothing to encourage individuals to invest in development and therefore I do believe that this is all part of a greater agenda and the way that it goes no matter what you say if you make a point one way you get buy to let landlords who simply pipe up and say this is an agenda against them, I don’t have an agenda against buy to let landlords I don’t have an agenda against individuals, I don’t have an agenda against success, I celebrate success, on the contrary, I’m actually angry that that the government is punishing success.\nWith regards to buy to let I do blame the government going back to the 1980s when the right to buy was introduced for not enforcing strict rules on building replacement properties for everything that was sold, it’s too late now, but there is so much investment money available in this country, the government could quite easily introduce incentives to encourage this money to be directed into build to rent and build to rent and sell, or whatever the case may be, but they don’t and the corporations are buying everything.\nAs I previously said, last year 15 of all residential sales were to corporate investors and that will will only increase year on year, the available stock is falling on average over the last two three years we have had 60 percent of the available stock on the market that we did over 20 years ago and these properties that are being bought up do not return to the market, those of you may be feeling smug and thinking I’m all right jack, you know I wouldn’t speak too soon because trust me Mr Chancellor, one way or another is going to come for you too.\nThe time for being complacent and the time for the arrogance of just pulling up the ladder should be over, because rather than be turning on each other and rather than be arguing because we think that if labour were in they would do this and if the conservatives were in they would do that, they are all rotten to the core, we should not even waste a minute of our time, or waste our breath arguing about which one should be in, none of them should be in, but it is down to us to actually make that decision to act and us as individuals, as a community and as a nation to say enough is enough we will vote these people out one by one and beat them at their own game.\nThat’s all I have to say on this matter and I think enough of the doom and gloom for now, in my next videos let’s move on to something that’s much more interesting investment opportunities oh I do intend to have a few more rants so keep watching, but I wouldn’t be me if I weren’t having a rant anyway goodbye for now and I’ll see you in the next video.",

The research highlights the need for urgent action to address the mental health crisis, particularly among those in their early 20s. This article delves into the key findings of the study, emphasizing the impact on education, employment, and the overall well-being of the younger demographic.\nRising Mental Health Issues among Young People\nOfficial data reveals a significant rise in the number of young people experiencing poor mental health. In the year 2021/22, 34% of individuals aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. This marks a considerable increase from the 24% reported in 2000. Notably, young women are disproportionately affected, being one-and-a-half times more likely to experience poor mental health compared to their male counterparts (41% vs. 26%).\nEducation Challenges and Workforce Impact\nThe study draws attention to the detrimental effects of mental health issues on education and subsequent employment outcomes. Young individuals with mental health problems often face barriers to obtaining a good education, leading to a higher likelihood of ending up unemployed or in low-paid jobs. Specifically, 79% of 18 to 24-year-olds “workless” due to ill health possess qualifications at GCSE level or below, in contrast to 34% of the overall population in that age group.\nSchool Attendance and Academic Performance\nThe impact of poor mental health is also evident in school attendance and academic achievement. In the autumn term of 2023, 12% of 11 to 16-year-olds with mental health issues missed more than 15 days of school, compared to just 2% of their healthier peers. Additionally, those experiencing mental health challenges between the ages of 11 and 14 are three times more likely not to pass five GCSEs, including maths and English, compared to their mentally healthier counterparts.\nEmployment Disparities and Low-Paid Jobs\nThe study underscores the connection between mental health problems and unemployment among young adults. Between 2018 and 2022, 21% of 18 to 24-year-olds with mental health issues were not in work, compared to 13% without such issues. Moreover, those with mental health problems have consistently been more likely to engage in low-paid work over the past decade. In 2022, 40% of employed 18 to 24-year-olds with mental health problems held low-paid jobs, compared to 35% of their healthier peers.\nPolicy Recommendations and Conclusion\nThe study concludes by advocating for targeted efforts to address the mental health crisis among lower-qualified young people. Recommendations include providing greater mental health support in colleges and sixth forms and ensuring measures are in place to prevent individuals from leaving compulsory education with low qualification levels. The Resolution Foundation urges policymakers to recognize the economic consequences of poor mental health, particularly among non-graduates, and calls for comprehensive support services to bridge the existing gaps.\nLouise Murphy, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, emphasizes the need for better support services in underserved colleges and improved provisions for exam resits. Jo Bibby, director of health at the Health Foundation, warns of the potential creation of a ‘lost generation’ if cross-government action is not taken promptly.\nIn response, a Government spokesman highlights the £2.5 billion Back to Work Plan, aimed at assisting one million people in finding employment. The plan includes tailored support for young people, acknowledging the importance of good employment and education in supporting mental health. The government affirms its commitment to mental health, citing record levels of support, including £16 billion allocated last year, with £1 billion specifically designated for children and young people.",

This and preceding governments have presided over a climate of nurturing a generation of entitlement and resentment, who would more than likely support legalised theft from OAPs by stealth.\nThe UK government’s own figures showed 83% of people over 80 would lose the payment, rising to 90% of those aged 66 to 79.\nIn the meantime, callous, arrogant and morally bankrupt politicians line up one after another to justify this atrocious decision, but we must not stand by and allow them to get away with it.\nThere is no point starting yet another petition, but that does not mean that signing a petition should be the end of the matter, it must not be the end of it.\nThese calculated thieves are banking on the fact that once again, the British people will slowly accept their actions which will be invariably camouflaged by lie after lie……\nIsn’t it ironic that the administration that was elected, or rather fell into office by default, even though they only received a minority of the vote, has done nothing but preach to everyone about misinformation, fake posts and everyone who does not agree with their disgraceful elitist agenda being labelled as ‘Far Right’\nI believe that OAPs deserve to receive their winter fuel allowance and if the ‘Neo Bolsheviks’ want to save some money, they can turn the heating off in the hotels for illegal immigrants, or better still, they could do their job and police our borders.\nIf we are going to do anything about this, if we want to make a difference, if we want to make it clear that these heartless, dishonest, insidious thieves will not get away with this, we must act together, we must act swiftly and we must ensure that we make it clear that we will not accept this, not today, tomorrow, not ever.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_tax-havens-and-the-hypocrisy-of-gibraltar/content_724.html": "Tax havens and the hypocrisy of Gibraltar\nWhat Is a Tax Haven?\nA tax haven is a country that offers foreign businesses and individuals minimal or no tax liability for their bank deposits in a politically and economically stable environment. They have tax advantages for corporations and for the very wealthy, and obvious potential for misuse in illegal tax avoidance schemes.\nCompanies and wealthy individuals may use tax havens legally as a means of stashing money earned abroad while avoiding higher taxes in their domicile country.\nTax havens may also be used illegally to hide money from tax authorities at home. The tax haven can make this work by being uncooperative with foreign tax authorities. In recent times, tax havens are under increasing international political pressure to cooperate with foreign tax fraud inquiries.\nKey Points\n- Tax havens encourage foreign depositors by offering tax advantages to corporations and the wealthy.\n- Many have secrecy laws that block information on their deposits from foreign tax authorities.\n- Depositing money in a tax haven is legal as long as the depositor pays the taxes required by the home jurisdiction.\nUnderstanding Tax Havens\nBroadly speaking, tax havens are jurisdictions that have very low taxes and no residency requirements for foreign entities and individuals willing to park money in their financial institutions.\nA combination of lax regulation and secrecy laws enable corporations and individuals to screen some of their income from tax authorities in other nations.\nThe Tax Justice Network maintains a Corporate Tax Haven Index that tracks the jurisdictions that it says are “most complicit” in helping multinational corporations evade taxes. As of 2021, the worst offenders were the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and Bermuda.1\nTax havens may be found in another country or merely in a separate jurisdiction:\nWhat about Gibraltar?\nTax in Gibraltar\nThe tax year in Gibraltar runs from 1st of July until 30th June the following year – the standard rate of tax for resident individuals is 20%. Tax residency is conferred on any individual who is resident in Gibraltar for a period of at least 183 days in the period of a year, or in excess of 300 days in three consecutive years. Along with tax residency, a number of other key benefits are granted as standard.\nGibraltar has no capital gains tax (CGT), and no inheritance tax, although residents may still be liable to for these in their country of origin. No tax is charged on interest accrued through savings, or on dividends originating from companies quoted on a recognised Stock Exchange. Any pension income within a Gibraltar QNUPS or QROPS can be limited to a flat rate of 2.5% making Gibraltar a great option for pensioners. And finally, there is no VAT or wealth tax.\nIs Gibraltar a tax haven?\nAll of the previously mentioned factors are enough to set Gibraltar apart as a location with many benefits, but there are key features of Gibraltar’s tax regime that make it an extremely attractive proposition for High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) as well. Under a scheme known as Category 2 Residency, qualifying individuals are only liable to pay tax on the first £80,000 of their worldwide income, which at current rates translates to approximately £28,000. It should be noted however that under the terms of Category 2 Residency, the individual will be liable to pay a minimum of £22,000 per year regardless of their earnings.\nIn order to qualify for Cat 2 residency an application must be made to the Finance Centre Director of Gibraltar accompanied by two references (one of which must be from a bank) along with a non-refundable fee of £1,000. The individual must not have been resident in Gibraltar in the preceding 5 years, and should have approved residential accommodation available to them during the qualifying year for the exclusive use of themselves and their family.\nFor High Net Worth Individuals, the rate of income tax in Gibraltar is an extremely compelling reason for seeking out Cat 2 residency. If all the above criteria are met, a certificate will be issued within approximately 2 weeks of application and all benefits will be extended to the qualifying individual. Although there are qualifying factors regarding year-long access to exclusive accommodation, there is no requirement for physical presence in Gibraltar outside of the 183 days per year stipulation.\nWhat about corporations?\nThis is where Gibraltar really stands out as a tax haven, companies registered in Gibraltar pay NO TAX on income generated outside of Gibraltar. If we consider the number of companies that do business online, digital-nomads and various other traders, the appeal and subsequent effect of Gibraltar on lost revenue becomes apparent\nThis is a state that may not be part of the EU, but it has special status that allows it to operate as if it were, in most cases. Gibraltar also has double-tax treaties with a large number of countries, including the UK, which was signed on the 1st of October 2019. This basically means that income for individuals or corporations that has been cleared through the Gibraltar tax system, will not be taxed again in the UK, or any other nation that has a a double-tax treaty with it.\nWhilst low taxation should be an aim for all western nations, this can only work by a smaller revenue being collected from more tax payers, be they individuals, or corporations.\nOur politicians are lying to us\nSuccessive politicians have done very little to deal with corporate taxation. The business wold has changed so much in recent years, to the degree that traditional income tax and corporation tax are in dire need of restructuring. Politicians have all be posturing about their desire to close down tax-haven loopholes, yet we have one of the most significant tax-haven on the doorstep of Europe and it is British!\nIn reality, there is and always has been a selection of locations where high-net-worth individuals and corporations can set up companies to avoid tax, yet in the meantime, working people are forced to pay tax on every single penny.\nConclusion\nIt is time for a dramatic change in the tax system, to ensure that corporations cannot exploit tax-havens and also, to ensure that all sales made in the UK result in a contribution to the Exchequer, resulting in more revenue and less of a burden on the rest of us.\nI have long been a supporter of sales-tax. The beauty of this is that no matter where a company is based, any sales made in the UK, will generate income for the the Exchequer, especially companies located in the far-east, who currently contribute nothing at all.\nAt the same time, hardly any business is done in cash anymore, just about all online sales are made by BACS or PayPal, making it very easy for the Inland Revenue to enforce sales-tax. This would of course, need to be introduced gradually, as it could be inflationary, but done properly, I can see no reason that over a decade or longer if necessary, the tax climate could be one where every sale made in the UK will automatically result in tax revenue, with different rates being at the disposal to the Chancellor, to use as incentives to stimulate the economy.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-zero-emission-mandate-rises-to-28-today/content_1102.html": "The zero emission mandate rises to 28% today\nThe zero emission mandate was introduced last year, forcing car manufacturers to sell a minimum of 22% zero emission vehicles, or face fines of £15,000 for every internal combustion engine vehicle sold above 78%.\nIn its first year, the mandate which is implemented across the EU in one for or another, has resulted in job losses at Ford, the closure of the Vauxhall car plant in Luton and Nissan axing 9,000 jobs in Sunderland.\nIn the meantime, VW, one of the most successful car manufacturers in history is teetering on the edge, with the real prospect of two manufacturing plants being closed in Germany, for the first time in its 87 year history. At the same time, shares in companies like Ford and Mercedes are trading for less than they did back in 2008.\nIf this is not enough, the Zero emission mandate rises to 28% from today, which will only serve to exacerbate the damage to European motor manufactures, with consumers being the end victims, as dealers are capping the number of ICEs that they make available, to avoid falling foul of these ridiculous laws, but no matter what they do, the number of vehicles that we actually want that are entering the pipeline are reducing drastically, if anyone thinks this is about emissions and climate change, they would be very wise to think again.\nAnother interesting fact that has recently come to light, is that despite the narrative from the media about the large take-up of used EVs the reality is quite different.\nIt has been noted by motor traders across the UK, that over 55% of used EVs are sold within 6 months of being bought, with many of them having had several owners, each successive owner dumping their reckless purchase even faster than the one before.\nOnce again, any contradiction to the narrative, is met with hostility and slander by the climate zealots, who are so blinkered that they are doing the dirty-work for the globalists who want to take your cars away from you.\nI stand by my initial thoughts, that this is not about emissions, but more about control, restrictions and the gradual erosion of our way of life as we know it.\nWhilst the driving experience of EVs may be appealing, life with a car that cannot be refuelled on the fly, is at best stressful and at worst an absolute nightmare.\nHaving said that, there is a place for everything and I have no doubt that for those with a drive or garage, where they can keep a small city run-around on charge for whenever it is needed, may be convenient, like a rechargeable vacuum cleaner, but for the millions who do not have a drive, being at the mercy of public chargers is neither convenient, nor cheap.\nA quick check revealed that the current rate for charging at the Northampton services today is a whooping 79p/kwh, and whilst most owners will charge at home, if they can, we all know that nobody fuels up on the Motorway unless they have to, but even so, there are thousands who do.\nThere is nothing wrong with evolution and EVs should have been allowed to evolve, and compete on a level playing field, which would have relied more on the development of more convenient energy sources, before these things were forced on the public, but as it stands a very high price is being paid across Europe, in fact the price is so high that we must ask ourselves why!\nThe rapid rise of the EU’s zero emission mandate from 22% to 28% has triggered significant disruption across the European automotive sector. This mandatory transition to electric vehicles has created substantial challenges for both manufacturers and consumers, with widespread industry implications and practical concerns about EV adoption.\nKey points:\n* Major job losses have occurred across the automotive sector, including 9,000 redundancies at Nissan Sunderland, the closure of Vauxhall’s Luton plant, and workforce reductions at Ford\n* Volkswagen, a cornerstone of European manufacturing, faces potential closure of two German plants for the first time in its 87-year history, whilst Ford and Mercedes shares have fallen below 2008 levels\n* The used EV market shows concerning trends, with over 55% of vehicles being resold within six months of purchase, suggesting significant user dissatisfaction or practical difficulties\n* Charging infrastructure remains problematic, particularly for those without home charging capabilities, with motorway service stations charging premium rates (currently 79p/kWh at Northampton services)\n* The mandate’s implementation has led to dealers restricting ICE vehicle availability to meet targets, effectively limiting consumer choice and market dynamics\n* While EVs may suit certain scenarios, particularly for those with home charging capabilities, the rapid, mandate-driven transition appears to be creating significant challenges for both industry and consumers",

According to daily Phileleftheros, on January 22 the UK’s High Court of Justice Business and Property Courts (Chancery Division) deemed inadmissible an appeal filed by the Cypriot government which was trying to reverse a previous ruling.\nThe litigants were informed of the decision last Friday, the paper said. On December 19 the ministry of commerce had filed an appeal against the court’s November 28 decision, which ruled against an objection by Cyprus against the cancellation of its halloumi trademark in the UK. The trademark had earlier been revoked by the UK’s Intellectual Property Office (Ukipo).\nCyprus had applied to register the trademark on December 22, 1990 and it was registered on February 22, 2002 as “Cheese made from sheep’s and/or goat’s milk; cheese made from blends of cow’s milk.”\nOn December 22, 2017 a British-based company, John & Pascalis Ltd, filed three separate applications to invalidate or revoke the trademark.\nThe subsequent loss of the trademark was due to the government’s failure to mount a challenge and dispatch the necessary paperwork within the set deadline. A disciplinary probe is underway within the commerce ministry to determine whether officials were derelict in their duties.\nFollowing the latest development in the UK court, the government’s last option is filing for a new trademark for halloumi with Ukipo. Commenting on Monday, Akel MP Andros Kafkalias, chair of the House agriculture committee, criticised the government for “fouling up.”\n“We risk not only being unable to register halloumi as a Protected Designation of Origin product but also, following the loss of the trademark in Great Britain, losing the trademark even in Cyprus. What a predicament!”\nCOMMENT\nOn December 22, 2017 a British-based company, John & Pascalis Ltd, filed three separate applications to invalidate or revoke the trademark. John & Pascalis Ltd is a food importers operating from North London, run by Cypriots! Their actions, albeit successful due to the incompetence of the administration in Cyprus may have far reaching consequences. The trademark in Cyprus could now be at risk, meaning that Halloumi made elsewhere could be legally sold in Cyprus and there is NOTHING that they can do about it.\nThis is not just a national embarrassment, it is also clear display of the quintessential Cypriot backstabbing that is destroying Cyprus, if it has not done so already! The administration in Cyprus seems to think it can carry on with its autocratic attitude, without consequences, they are now subject to EU law and there are many issues in Cyprus that are yet to be resolved.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_we-need-to-stand-and-reclaim-democracy-2/content_665.html": "We need to stand and reclaim Democracy\nThe Dangers of Allowing Division and Exploiting Differences\nThe United Kingdom has always been a diverse nation, with people from various backgrounds, races, religions and creeds living together. For the most part, we have coexisted peacefully and seen ourselves as one people – British. However, there are some dangerous trends emerging that threaten to divide us and set us against each other.\nIn one of my previous videos discussing immigration, I emphasized that I do not wish my words to be misunderstood or misrepresented. The last thing I want is for people of different backgrounds to watch me nervously, wondering if I am spreading division, racism, fascism or anything of the sort. For those who know me from my other channel about property, you’ll know I always try to tell the truth in an industry filled with lies. No matter your background, where you’re from or what your race or creed, I will go above and beyond to help if you reach out. I hold contempt towards the elitist big corporations who are successfully dividing people for their own benefit, manipulating the nation and the Western world.\nA few weeks ago I used the term “woke warriors” and faced a barrage of abuse in messages, emails and more. This is because I won’t tolerate the virtue signaling hypocrites who create division where there is none. They highlight and exaggerate non-existent divides so they can appear more virtuous and boast at dinner parties. This is far more dangerous than we realize – entire nations have allowed social divisions to be exploited, resulting not just in civil unrest but war.\nCyprus is a perfect example. Divisions were created when it was under British rule, dividing people into “Turkish Cypriots” and “Greek Cypriots” who are actually the same race. This was clear before DNA testing because Cyprus has the highest rate of thalassemia in the world, with 51% of Cypriots carrying the genetic trait. Almost non-existent in the UK, it affects iron levels but is usually harmless. However, if two carriers have children, they risk passing on thalassemia major which requires monthly blood transfusions to live. This was before DNA confirmed all Cypriots share a gene pool, yet small divisions were exploited until they turned on each other, dividing the island.\nI don’t suggest this will happen in the UK, but we must be vigilant against political forces creating and exploiting divisions – it’s very dangerous. What can we do? I previously announced I will stand in the next election for Northampton North. It’s an impossible task – no independent has ever won or even recovered their deposit. But I won’t let that stop me. I don’t expect to win, but want to inspire others around the country where independents have a chance.\nWe’re conditioned to think MPs must be from elite schools and participate in disturbing rituals. This is false – they are the least qualified to represent us. The most qualified come from real life – cab drivers, hairdressers, single parents. Whoever you are, wherever you’re from, stand up and make a difference. I don’t suggest an army of independents will govern, but we can win enough seats to force change and stop the exploitation and madness of the arrogant, traitorous mainstream parties.\nDo not allow them to divide you. They are rats from different sewers. No matter who you elect, they will answer to party whips, not you. How many wanted their MP to invade Iraq? Probably none, yet MPs voted for it. I will publish their names in a Wall of Shame. As an independent, your beliefs don’t matter – it’s good we disagree, that’s democracy. We must take back our country and implement true democracy.\nIn summary:\n– People from diverse backgrounds have mostly coexisted peacefully in the UK, seeing ourselves as one people. But dangerous trends threaten to divide us against each other.\n– I do not wish to spread division or racism. I want to bring people together.\n– Elitist corporations are exploiting and manipulating divisions in society for their own gain. This is incredibly dangerous, as history shows.\n– Cyprus is an example of where divisions were created and exploited, leading to civil war and a divided nation.\n– We must be vigilant against political forces exaggerating differences when the reality is we have much in common.\n– I will stand in the next election, even though I won’t win, to inspire a movement of independent candidates throughout the country.\n– Real people with real life experience should stand, not just elite party cronies.\n– We need enough independents to hold the balance of power and force change, stopping the madness of mainstream parties who divide and exploit.\n– Do not let them divide us against each other. We need to take back our democracy.",

This book delves into the various methods employed to manipulate and mould the thoughts, behaviours, and beliefs of individuals within a given society. It examines the historical context, psychological tactics, and technological advancements that have propelled social engineering to unprecedented levels.\nChapter by chapter, this book uncovers the origins and evolution of social engineering, shedding light on the ideological frameworks that influence societal development. It explores the power of propaganda, mass persuasion, and media manipulation, revealing how these tools are used to shape public opinion and control narratives.\nFurthermore, “Social Engineering: A Society by Design” investigates the role of education and social conditioning in shaping individuals’ values and attitudes. It delves into the ways in which consumerism is engineered through advertising and marketing techniques, as well as the influence of political agendas on societal norms and behaviours.\nThe book also explores the impact of technology on social engineering, from the pervasive surveillance mechanisms to the algorithms that shape our online experiences. It examines the role of social media in amplifying social engineering tactics and analyses the ethical implications of these practices.\nDrawing on historical case studies, this book examines real-world examples of social engineering, providing readers with a deeper understanding of its mechanisms and effects. It highlights moments in history when societies have been subjected to extensive social engineering, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and resilience in the face of manipulation.\n“Social Engineering: A Society by Design” also raises crucial questions about the ethical boundaries of social engineering. It prompts readers to consider the potential consequences and ethical implications of engineering societies to fit predetermined agendas.\nLastly, the book concludes by envisioning the future of social engineering, considering the impact of emerging technologies and the potential for positive social engineering initiatives. It emphasizes the importance of building a resilient society that is aware of and resistant to manipulation, fostering empowerment and collective well-being.\nWe have all heard about 1984 by George Orwell, which led to the term ‘Orwellian society’ but there are many facets to incremental decline in to dystopia, however there was a man who preceded George Orwell and was in fact one of his teachers, who had a different vision, one that would precede and actually lay the foundation for the social structure that will follow.\nThere are many different ways that society can be controlled, with different philosophers, sighting different opinions, definitions and predictions, however for the purposes of my research, I have selected a few definitions that relate to my personal thoughts.\nWhen social structure is concerned, by far the most common visual conceptualisation tends to be linear, polarised, and either one extreme or another:\nSocialism <__________________> Capitalism\nUtopia <____________________>Dystopia\nCollectivism <________________> Individualism\nConservatism <_______________> Hedonism\n…………and so on.\nIt is my opinion, that the linear concept has been the norm as much by design, as it is by evolution, because the most important factor in any form of social engineering is ‘polarisation’\nIn ancient Rome & Greece, there were the Greeks and the Romans, but everyone else were ‘Barbarians’\nDuring the Muslim wars, there were Muslims and ‘infidels’\nDuring the Crusades, there were Christians and Saracens\nAnd so, it continues, because when the masses have the linear concept in their minds, they know that they are on one side or another.\nHowever, I would argue, that in reality, all social structures are not linear, but circular, in fact any number of circles overlapping one another in the form of a Venn diagram, with all the circles moving around like positively charged Ions, changing the dynamics of the society that they influence.\nWhy is this important?\nI fervently believe that this is crucial if we are to understand how fragile our society really is, but more importantly, unlike the linear example, where society would in essence need to swing from one side to another, using the circular structure to define the different influences on society and decipher their impact upon us.\nWhat is further highlighted by the circular example, is that it demonstrates how different aspects of social structure can have a greater influence on society, incrementally and more importantly, by stealth.\nWe need only reflect on the changes to our society over the last two decades, to fully appreciate, just how much things have changed, but even for those who have lived through this period as mature adults, it is almost impossible to pinpoint what changed and when it changed, because this all crept up on us by stealth.\nThe truly astute social manipulators do not reveal their hand, they use the very same tactic that Houdini used, in his public feats of magic, which was in fact, little more than trickery, but the key, was misdirection.\nI would firstly like to refer to a speech made by the very wise literary great, Aldus Huxley, which he made before an audience at the Berkeley language centre in 1962.\nThe Ultimate Revolution: Aldus Huxley\nMarch 20, 1962 Berkeley Language Centre\n“First of all, I’d like to say that the conference at Santa Barbara was not directly concerned with the control of the mind. That was a conference—there have been two of them now, at the University of California Medical centre in San Francisco (one this year which I didn’t attend), and one two years ago where there was a considerable discussion on this subject—at Santa Barbara we were talking about technology in general and the effects it’s likely to have on society, and the problems related to the transplanting of technology into underdeveloped countries.\nWell now, in regard to this problem of the ultimate revolution: this has been very well summed up by the moderator. In the past we can say that all revolutions have essentially aimed at changing the environment in order to change the individual. I mean, there’s been the political revolution, the economic revolution, in the time of the reformation, the religious revolution. All these aimed, as I say, not directly at the human being, but at his surroundings. So that by modifying the surroundings you did remove an effect upon the human being.\nToday we are faced, I think, with the approach of what may be called the ultimate revolution, the final revolution, where man can act directly on the mind-body of his fellows. Well, needless to say, some kind of direct action on human mind-bodies has been going on since the beginning of time, but this has generally been of a violent nature. The Techniques of terrorism have been known from time immemorial, and people have employed them with more or less ingenuity, sometimes with the utmost cruelty, sometimes with a good deal of skill acquired by a process of trial and error, finding out the best ways of using torture, imprisonment, constraints of various kinds.\nBut as—I think it was Metternich—said many years ago: you can do everything with bayonets except sit on them. If you are going to control any population for any length of time, you must have some measure of consent. It’s exceedingly difficult to see how pure terrorism can function indefinitely. It can function for a fairly long time, but I think sooner or later you have to bring in an element of persuasion, an element of getting people to consent to what is happening to them.\nWell, it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this: that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy—who have always existed and presumably will always exist—to get people actually to love their servitude. This is, it seems to me, the ultimate in malevolent revolutions, shall we say. And this is a problem which has interested me for many years and about which I wrote thirty years ago a fable, Brave New World, which is essentially the account of a society (making use of all the devices at that time available, and some of the devices which I imagined to be possible) making use of them in order to, first of all, to standardize the population, to iron out inconvenient human differences, to create, so to say, mass-produced models of human beings arranged in kind of a scientific caste system.\nAnd since then, I have continued to be extremely interested in this problem, and I have noticed with increasing dismay that a number of the predictions which were purely fantastic when I made them thirty years ago have come true, or seem in process of coming true; that a number of techniques about which I talked seem to be here already. And there seems to be a general movement in the direction of this kind of ultimate revolution, this method of control, by which a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which (by any decent standard) they ought not to enjoy—the enjoyment of servitude. Well, this process, as I say, has gone on for over the years, and I have become more and more interested in what is happening.\nAnd here I would like briefly to compare the parable of Brave New World with another parable which was put forth more recently in George Orwell’s book, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell wrote his book, I think, between 45 and 48, at the time when the Stalinist terror regime was still in full swing, and just after the collapse of the Hitlerian terror regime. And his book—which I admire greatly, it’s a book of very great talent and extraordinary ingenuity—shows, so to say, a projection into the future of the immediate past (of what for him was the immediate past) and the immediate present. It was a projection into the future of a society where control was exercised wholly by terrorism and violent attacks upon the mind-body of individuals.\nWhereas my own book—which was written in 1932, when there was only a mild dictatorship in the form of Mussolini in existence—was not overshadowed by the idea of terrorism, and I was therefore free in a way in which Orwell was not free, to think about these other methods of control, these non-violent methods. And I’m inclined to think that the scientific dictatorships of the future (and I think there are going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world) will be probably a good deal nearer to the Brave New World pattern than to the Nineteen Eighty-Four pattern. They will a good deal nearer not because of any humanitarian qualms of the scientific dictators, but simply because the Brave New World pattern is probably a good deal more efficient than the other. That, if you can get people to consent to the state of affairs in which they are living—the state of servitude, the state of being, having their differences ironed out, and being made amenable to mass production methods on the social level—if you can do this, then you are likely to have a much more stable and much more lasting society, a much more easily controllable society, than you would if you were relying wholly on clubs and firing squads and concentration camps.\nSo that my own feeling is that the Nineteen Eighty-Four picture was tinged, of course, by the immediate past and present in which Orwell was living, but the past and present of those years does not represent, I feel, the likely trend of what is going to happen. Needless to say, we shall never get rid of terrorism. This will always find its way to the surface. But I think that insofar as dictators become more and more scientific, more and more concerned with the technically perfectly running society, they will be more and more interested in the kind of techniques which I imagined and described from existing realities in Brave New World. So that, it seems to me, then, that this ultimate revolution is not really very far away; that already, the number of techniques for bringing about this kind of control are here. And it remains to be seen when and where and by whom they will first be applied in any large scale.\nAnd first, let me talk a little bit about the improvement, even, in the techniques of terrorism. I think there have been improvements. Pavlov, after all, made some extremely profound observations both on animals and on human beings. And he found, among other things, that conditioning techniques applied to animals or humans in a state either of psychological or physical stress sank in, so to say, very deeply into the mind-body of the creature, and were extremely difficult to get rid of; that they seemed to be embedded more deeply than other forms of conditioning. And this, of course, this fact, I think, was discovered empirically in the past. People did make use of many of these techniques. But the difference between the old empirical intuitive methods and our own methods is the difference between a, sort of, hit and miss craftsman’s point of view, and the genuinely scientific point of view. I mean, I think there is a real difference between ourselves and, say, the inquisitors of the sixteenth century. We know much more precisely what we are doing than they knew, and we can extend (because of our theoretical knowledge) what we are doing over a wider area with a greater assurance of producing something that really works.\nIn this context I would like to mention the extremely interesting chapters in Dr. William Sargant’s Battle for the Mind, where he points out how intuitively some of the great religious teachers, leaders, of the past hit on the Pavlovian method. He speaks specifically of Wesley’s method of producing conversions, which were essentially based upon a technique of heightening psychological stress to the limit by talking about hellfire, and so making people extremely vulnerable to suggestion, and then suddenly releasing this stress by offering hopes of heaven. And this is a very interesting chap—of showing how completely on purely intuitive and empirical grounds a skilled natural psychologist, as Wesley was, could discover these Pavlovian methods.\nWell, as I say, we now know the reason why these techniques worked, and there’s no doubt at all that we can (if we want to) carry them much further than was possible in the past. And of course, in the recent history of brainwashing—both as applied to prisoners of war and to the lower personnel within the communist party in China—we see that the Pavlovian methods have been applied systematically and evidently with extraordinary efficacy. I mean, I think there can be no doubt that, by the application of these methods, a very large army of totally devoted people has been created. The conditioning has been driven in, so to say, by a kind of psychological iontophoresis into the very depths of the people’s being, and has got so deep that it’s very difficult for it to ever be rooted out. And these methods, I think, are a real refinement on the older methods of terror, because they combine methods of terror with methods of acceptance; that the person who is subjected to a form of terroristic stress, but for the purpose of inducing a kind of “voluntary” acceptance of the psychological state in which he has been driven and the state of affairs within which he finds himself. So there, as I say, has been a definite improvement, shall we say, even in the techniques of terrorism.\nWell, then we come to the consideration of other techniques, of non-terroristic techniques, for inducing consent and for inducing people to love their servitude. Here—I don’t think I can possibly go into all of them, because I don’t know all of them, but, I mean, I can mention a few of the more obvious methods which can now be used, and which are based upon recent scientific findings.\nFirst of all, there are the methods connected with straight suggestion and hypnosis. I think we know much more about this subject than was known in the past. People, of course, have always known about suggestion, and although they didn’t know the word “hypnosis,” they certainly practiced it in various ways. But we have, I think, a much greater knowledge of the subject than in the past, and we can make use of our knowledge in ways which I think the past was never able to make use of it. For example, one of the things we now know for certain is that there is, of course, an enormous—I mean, this has always been known—a very great difference between individuals in regard to their suggestibility. But we now, I think, know pretty clearly the sort of statistical structure of a population in regard to its suggestibility.\nIt’s very interesting when you look at the findings of different fields. I mean, in the field of hypnosis, in the field of administering placebos, for example, in the field of general suggestion, in states of drowsiness or of light sleep you will find the same sorts of orders of magnitude continually cropping up. You’ll find, for example, that the experienced hypnotist will tell one that the percentage of people who can be hypnotized with the utmost facility, just like that, is about twenty percent, and about a corresponding number at the other end of the scale are very, very difficult or almost impossible to hypnotize. But in between there lies a large mass of people who can, with more or less difficulty, be hypnotized; that they can gradually be (if you work hard enough at it) got into the hypnotic state.\nAnd, in the same way, the same sort of figures crop up again, for example, in relation to the administration of placebos. A big experiment was carried out three, four years ago in the general hospital in Boston on post-operative cases, where several hundred men and women suffering comparable kinds of pain after serious operations were given injections whenever they asked for them, whenever the pain got bad. And the injections fifty percent of the time were of morphine, and fifty percent of the time of distilled water. And about twenty percent of those who went through the experiment, about twenty percent of them got just as much relief from the distilled water as from the morphine. About twenty percent got no relief from the distilled water. And in between were those who got some relief or got relief occasionally. So, yet again, we see the same sort of distribution.\nAnd similarly, with regard to what in Brave New World I called hypnopaedia, the sleep teaching, I was talking not long ago to a man who manufactures records which people can listen to during the light part of sleep. I mean, these are records for getting rich, for sexual satisfaction, for confidence in salesmanship, and so on. And he said it’s very interesting that these are records sold on a money-back basis, and he says there is regularly between fifteen and twenty percent of people who write indignantly saying the records don’t work at all, and he sends the money back at once. There are, on the other hand, over twenty percent who write enthusiastically, saying they are much richer, their sexual life is much better, et cetera, et cetera. And these, of course, are the dream clients, and they buy more of these records. And then, in between, are those who complain they’re not get much results, and they have to have letters written to them saying, “Go persist, my dear! Go on and you will get there,” and they generally do get results in the long run.\nWell, as I say, on the basis of this, I think we see quite clearly that the human populations can be categorized according to their suggestibility fairly clearly. I suspect very strongly that this twenty percent is the same in all these cases, and I suspect also that it would not be at all difficult to recognize and very early childhood who are those who are extremely suggestible, and who are those extremely unsuggestible, and who are those who occupy the intermediate space. Quite clearly, if everybody were extremely unsuggestible, organized society would be quite impossible. And if everybody were extremely suggestible, then dictatorship would be absolutely inevitable. I mean, it’s very fortunate that we have people who are moderately suggestible in the majority, and who therefore preserve us from dictatorship, but do permit organized society to be formed. But once given the fact that there are these twenty percent of highly suggestible people, it becomes quite clear that this is a matter of enormous political importance. For example, any demagogue who is able to get hold of a large number of these twenty percent of suggestible people and to organize them is really in a position to overthrow any government in any country.\nAnd I mean, I think this—after all, we’ve had the most incredible example in recent years of what can be done by efficient methods of suggestion and persuasion in the form of Hitler. Anybody who’s read, for example, Bullock’s life of Hitler comes forth from with this horrified admiration for this infernal genius who really understood human weaknesses, I think, almost better than anybody, and who exploited them with all the resources then available. I mean, he knew everything. I mean, for example, he knew intuitively this Pavlovian truth that conditioning installed in a state of stress or fatigue goes much deeper than conditioning installed at other times. This was why all his big speeches were organized at night. He speaks of this quite frankly, of course, in Mein Kampf. He says this was done solely because people are tired at night and therefore much less capable of resisting persuasion than they would be during the day. And in all his techniques he was using he had discovered intuitively, and by trial and error, a great many of the weaknesses which we now know about on a sort of scientific way, I think, much more clearly than he did.\nBut the fact remains that this differential of suggestibility, this susceptibility to hypnosis, I do think is something which has to be considered very carefully in relation to any kind of thought about democratic government. If there are twenty percent of the people who really can be suggested into believing almost anything—as evidently they can be—then we have to take extremely careful steps to prevent the rise of demagogues who will drive them on into extreme positions, and then organize them into very, very dangerous private armies which may overthrow the government.\nThis, as I say, is in this field of pure persuasion. I think we do know much more than we did in the past, and obviously we now have mechanisms for multiplying the demagogue’s voice and image in a quite hallucinatory way. I mean, the television and the radio—Hitler was making enormous use of the radio, he could speak to millions of people simultaneously. This alone creates an enormous gulf between the modern and the ancient demagogue. The ancient demagogue could only appeal to as many people as his voice could reach by the yelling at his utmost. But the modern demagogue can touch literally millions at a time. And, of course, with this multiplication of his image he can produce this kind of hallucinatory effect which is of enormous hypnotic and suggestive importance.\nBut then there are the various other methods one can think of which have, thank heaven, as yet not been used, but which obviously could be used. There is, for example, the pharmacological method. This was one of the things I talked about in Brave New World. I invented a hypothetical drug called soma, which of course could not exist as it stood there, because it was simultaneously a stimulant, a narcotic, and a hallucinogen, which seems unlikely in one substance. But the point is that, if you applied several different substances, you could get almost all these results even now. And the really interesting thing about the new chemical substances, the new mind-changing drugs, is this: that whereas, if you look back into history, it’s clear that man has always had a hankering after mind-changing chemicals. He has always desired to take holidays from himself. But the—and this is the most extraordinary effect of all, is that every naturally occurring stimulant, narcotic, sedative, or hallucinogen was discovered before the dawn of history.\nI don’t think there is one single one of these naturally occurring ones which modern science has discovered. Modern science has, of course, better ways of extracting the active principles of these drugs, and of course has discovered numerous ways of synthesizing new substances of extreme power. But the actual discovery of these naturally occurring things was made by primitive man goodness knows how many centuries ago.\nThere is, for example, underneath the lake dwellings of the early Neolithic which have been dug up in Switzerland we find poppy-heads, which looks as though people were already using this most ancient and powerful and most dangerous of narcotics, even in the days of the rise of agriculture. So that man was apparently a dope addict before he was a farmer—which is a very, very curious comment on human nature!\nBut the difference, as I say, between the ancient mind-changers, the traditional mind- changers, and these new substances is that they were extremely harmful and the new ones are not. I mean, even the permissible mind-changer—alcohol—is not entirely harmless, as people may have noticed. And the other ones, the non-permissible ones, such as opium and cocaine (opium and all its derivatives), are very harmful indeed. They rapidly produce addiction, and in some cases lead at an extraordinary rate to physical degeneration and death. Whereas these new substances—this is really very extraordinary—that a number of these new mind-changing substances can produce enormous revolutions within the mental side of our being, and yet do almost nothing to the physiological side. I mean, you can have an enormous revolution—for example, with LSD-25, or with the newly synthesized drug psilocybin, which is the active principle of the Mexican sacred mushroom—you can have this enormous mental revolution with no more physiological revolution than you would get from drinking two cocktails. And this is a really most extraordinary effect.\nAnd it is, of course, true that pharmacologists are producing a great many wonder drugs where the cure is almost worse than the disease. Every year, a new edition of medical textbooks contains a longer and longer chapter on what are called iatrogenic diseases—that is to say, diseases caused by doctors. And this is quite true. That many of the wonder drugs are extremely dangerous. I mean, they can produce extraordinary effects, and in critical conditions they should certainly be used. But they should be used with the utmost caution.\nBut there is evidently a whole class of drugs effecting the central nervous system which can produce enormous changes in sedation, in euphoria, in energizing the whole mental process, without doing any perceptible harm to the body. And in this sense, this represents, it seems to me, the most extraordinary revolution. In the hands of a dictator, these substances of one kind or the other could be used with, first of all, complete harmlessness, and the result would be that you can imagine a euphoric which would make people thoroughly happy even in the most abominable circumstances. I mean, these things are possible. This is the extraordinary thing. I mean, after all, this has even been true with the crude old drugs.\nI mean, a houseman years ago remarked—a propos of Milton’s Paradise Lost—he says, “And beer does more than Milton can to justify God’s ways to man.” And beer is, of course, an extremely crude drug compared with these ones. And you can certainly say that some of the psychic energizers and the new hallucinates can do incomparably more than Milton and all the Theologians combined could possibly do to make the terrifying mystery of our existence seem more tolerable than it does.\nSo that here, I think, one has an enormous area in which the ultimate revolution could function very well indeed. An area in which a great deal of control could be used not through terror, but through making life seem much more enjoyable than it normally does—enjoyable to the point, whereas I have said before, human beings come to love a state of things by which any reasonable and decent human standard they ought not to love. And this, I think, is perfectly possible.\nWell then, very briefly, let me speak about one of the more recent developments in the sphere of neurology: the implantation of electrodes in the brain. This of course has been done on the large scale in animals, and in a few cases, it’s been done in the cases of the hopelessly insane. And anybody who has watched the behaviour of rats with electrodes planted in different centres must come away from this experience with the most extraordinary doubts about what on Earth is in store for us if ever this is got a hold of by a dictator.\nI saw not long ago some rats in the Magoun’s laboratory at UCLA. There were two sets of them: one with electrodes planted in a pleasure center. And the technique was that they had a bar which they pressed, which turned on a very small current for a short space of time, which had a wire connected with that electrode, and which stimulated this pleasure centre—which was evidently absolutely ecstatic. These rats were pressing the bar 18,000 times a day! Apparently, if you kept them from pressing the bar for a day, they would press the bar 36,000 times on the following day until they fell down in complete exhaustion! And they would neither eat, nor be interested in the opposite sex, and would just go on pressing this bar. Then, the most extraordinary rats were those where the electrode was planted halfway between the pleasure and the pain center, and where evidently the result was a kind of mixture of the most wonderful ecstasy and being on the rack at the same time. And you would see the rat sort of looking at its bar and sort of saying, “To be or not to be, that is the question.” Finally it would approach, and do it, and then go back with this awful—I mean, if I can humanize and anthropomorphize—I mean, he was feeling something terribly mixed. And he would wait for quite a long time before pressing the bar again. But he would always press it again! I mean, this was the extraordinary thing.\nI noticed in the most recent issue of Scientific American there’s a very interesting article on electrodes in the brains of chickens, where the technique is very ingenious: you sink into their brains a little socket with a screw on it, and the electrode then can be screwed deeper and deeper into the brain stem, and you can test at any moment according to the depth (which goes in fractions of a millimetre) of what you’re stimulating. And these creatures are not merely stimulated by wire, they’re fitted with a miniaturized radio receiver weighing less than an ounce, which is attached to them, so that they can be communicated with at a distance. I mean, they can run about in the barnyard, and you can press the button, and this particular area of the brain to which the electrode has been screwed down to will be stimulated. And you will get these fantastic phenomena that a sleepy chicken will suddenly get up and rush about, or an active chicken will suddenly sit down and go to sleep, or a hen will suddenly start sitting as though it were hatching out an egg, or a rooster will start fighting or will suddenly go into a state of extreme depression.\nThe whole picture of the absolute control of the drives is terrifying. And in the few cases in which this has been done with very sick human beings, the effects are evidently very remarkable too. I was talking last summer in England to Grey Walter—who is the most eminent exponent of the electroencephalogram technique in England—and he was telling me that he’s seen hopeless inmates at asylums with these things in their heads, and these people were suffering from uncontrollable depression. And they had these electrodes inserted into something resembling, evidently, the pleasure centre of the rat. Anyhow, when they felt too bad, they just pressed a button on the battery in their pocket, and he said the result was fantastic. The mouth was pointing down, would suddenly turn up, and they would evidently feel—I don’t know for how long at a time—very cheerful and happy. So here, again, one sees the most extraordinary revolutionary techniques which are now available to us.\nNow, I think what is obviously perfectly clear is that, for the present, these techniques are not being much used except in a purely experimental way. But I think it is extraordinarily important for us to realize what is happening, to make ourselves acquainted with what has already happened, and then to use a certain amount of imagination to extrapolate into the future the sort of things that might happen. I mean, what might happen if these fantastically powerful techniques were used by unscrupulous people in authority? What on Earth would happen? What sort of society would we get?\nAnd I think this is peculiarly important, because as one sees when looking back over history, we have allowed in the past all those advances in technology—which have profoundly changed our social and individual life—we have allowed them to take us by surprise. I mean, it seems to me that, during the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, when the new machines were making possible the factory system, it was not beyond the wit of man to look at what was happening, and to project into the future, and maybe to forestall the really dreadful consequences which plagued England and most of western Europe and most of this country for about sixty or seventy years.\nThe horrible abuses of the factory system. And if a certain amount of forethought had been devoted to the problem at that time, if people had first of all found out what was happening, and then used their imagination to see what might happen, and then had gone on to work out means by which the worst applications of the new techniques would not take place, then I think western humanity might have been spared about three generations of utter misery which was imposed on the poor at that time.\nAnd similarly with various technological advances now. I mean, it’s quite clear we have to start thinking very, very hard about the problems of automation. And again, I think we have to think still more profoundly about the problems which may arise in relation to these new techniques which may contribute to this ultimate revolution. Our business is to, first of all, as I say, to be aware of what is happening, then to use our imaginations to see what might happen, how this might be abused, and then if possible, to see that the enormous powers which we now possess thanks to these scientific and technological advances shall be used for the benefit of human beings and not for their ultimate degradation.\nThank you.\nWhat did Aldus Huxley reveal in his speech?\nAldus made an argument why those in power have tried various different methods to not only maintain and enforce power, but more importantly, the manner in which they can maintain control with revolt. As he quite rightly stated, even totalitarianism requires some measure of compliance from the people, because when they are pushed too far, they lose any fear for their own lives and in that event, no degree of draconian measures will temper them when they revolt.\nIn this endeavour, the puppet masters have continually adapted the manner in which they seek to control the masses, with the most effective method always being the ‘threat from an enemy’ in post-war years, it was Communism in the west, Capitalism in the east, which mutated again after the end of the cold war, in to various factions, including the threat from Russia, Afghanistan, various countries or leaders around the middle east, ISIS and now we are increasingly manipulated by the ‘terms of the current climate’ be that racism, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia or just the catch-all label of ‘Far Right’\nThe puppet masters have become increasingly skilled at misinformation, misdirection and ‘psychological conditioning’ which was first researched by Ivan Pavlov.\nDuring his speech, Aldus Huxley refers to the ‘Pavlovian conditioning’ which is to some degree, a form of manipulative control that we are all subjected to in the modern day, in one form or another.\nThe term “Pavlovian” refers to something related to or reminiscent of the experiments and theories associated with Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist and psychologist. Ivan Pavlov conducted influential research on classical conditioning, which involves associating a neutral stimulus with a reflexive response.\nIn Pavlov’s experiments, he conditioned dogs to associate the sound of a bell with the presentation of food. Initially, the bell (neutral stimulus) did not elicit any response from the dogs. However, by repeatedly pairing the bell with the food, Pavlov observed that the dogs began to salivate (reflexive response) in anticipation of the food whenever they heard the bell. This demonstrated the process of classical conditioning, where a previously neutral stimulus gains the ability to elicit a response through association.\nWhen something is described as “Pavlovian,” it typically means it relates to this classical conditioning process. It suggests that a certain stimulus or situation triggers an automatic, reflexive response or behaviour due to conditioning or learned associations. This term is often used to describe behaviours or reactions that are automatic, involuntary, and driven by previous experiences or associations.\nI will be delving into the work of Ivan Pavlov in later chapters.\n“I would rather lie face down on the ground and use my body as a bridge, than stand proud and tall and use my body as a wall.”\n― Kamand Kojouri\nTo be continued………………",

US-based Rogan’s comments were viewed more than 1.7 million times on YouTube in a single day. His podcast has 14.5 million subscribers on Spotify, the streaming platform, nearly three times more than the second most popular.\nHigh-Profile Critics\nHe is the latest high-profile figure to draw attention to the laws, which allow for jail sentences of up to seven years to be imposed on those convicted of “stirring up hatred” against protected groups such as trangender people, cross-dressers or the disabled.\nRogan’s Criticism of Police Statement\nRogan read a report of a Police Scotland statement in which the force claimed that performers, such as actors and comedians, would not be specifically “targeted” when the new law comes into force.\nNo Guarantee for Comedians\n“Have you seen that wild s–t in Scotland where they’re targeting comedians for hate crime laws,” Rogan, a former stand-up, said. “Police Scotland say,\n“we won’t target comedians under new hate crime law. That’s what you say now, but stand-up shows still come under its scope.”\nRogan said that while police had denied that comedy venues or theatres would be specifically targeted by officers, it would still be possible for performers to be prosecuted under the law.\nGovernment “Out of Their Minds”\nHe added: “This is so ridiculous.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_rachael-reeves-delivers-the-2024-budget/content_326.html": "Rachael Reeves delivers the 2024 budget\nRachel Reeves has vowed to “restore stability” to the British economy as she unveils £40bn of tax rises.\nThe Chancellor has vowed to stick to Labour’s manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on “working people”, defined loosely by Sir Keir Starmer as those with only “a small amount of savings”.\nBut she said a £22bn “black hole” left behind by the last government, added to other pressures such as compensation schemes, meant she would have to increase taxes £40bn.\nThis includes a widely-trailed rise in National Insurance employer contributions, raising £25bn.\nShe also announced increases to capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty, alcohol duty, tobacco duty and air passenger duty.\nHowever, in one bright spot for households, she said fuel duty would not rise.\nAddressing MPs, Ms Reeves: “This is a changed Labour party and we will restore stability to our country again. The scale and seriousness of the situation that we have inherited cannot be underestimated.”\nCompensation schemes for victims of the infected blood scandal and the Post Office scandal had not been budgeted for by the Conservatives, she said. They are expected to cost £11.8bn and £1.8bn respectively.\nShe also announced a “crackdown on fraud in our welfare system”, through upgrades to government computer systems, that is expected to save taxpayers £4.3bn.\nAn upgrade to HM Revenue & Customs’ systems is also expected to tackle tax avoidance, bringing in an extra £6.5bn over five years.\nRefresh this article for regular updates throughout this afternoon.\nTax rises:\n- National Insurance, employer contributions\n- Capital gains tax\n- Inheritance tax\n- Air passenger duty\n- Alcohol duty\n- Tobacco duty\n- Stamp duty\nInflation, debt and the economy\nMs Reeves said the Government will keep the Bank of England’s inflation target at 2pc.\nBut she warned household finances had been “stretched to their limit” by recent price rises.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility now forecasts consumer price inflation will average 2.5pc this year, 2.6pc in 2025, then 2.3pc in 2026, 2.1pc in 2027, 2.1pc in 2028 and 2.0pc in 2029, the Chancellor said.\nOn economic growth, she says Labour’s plans will boost output.\nThe OBR is forecasting annual growth of 1.1pc in 2024, 2.0pc in 2025, 1.8pc in 2026, 1.5pc in 2027, 1.5pc in 2028 and 1.6pc in 2029.\nOn borrowing, she says the Government will stick to its “stability rule” early – meaning it will not borrow to fund day-to-day spending by 2027/28, by which point the budget will be in surplus.\nMinimum wage increase\nThe Government will increase the National Living Wage by 6.7pc to £12.21 an hour, Ms Reeves said.\nIt follows a recommendation by the Low Pay Commission and is expected to be worth up to £1,400 a year for a full-time worker.\nFor the first time, she said, the system will also shift towards “a single adult rate” – phased in over time – partly by increasing the minimum wage for 18 to 20-year-olds by 16.3pc initially to £10 an hour.\nState pension\nUnder the Government’s “triple lock”, which Labour committed itself to during the election, Ms Reeves says the basic and state pension will be uprated by 4.1pc next year.\nThis means 12 million pensioners will gain £470 next year.\nShe adds this means spending on the state pension is forecast to rise by over £31bn by 2029-30 “to ensure that our pensioners are protected in their retirement.”\nFuel duty\nA temporary 5p cut to fuel duty was on course to be reversed next year, with the rate also increased in line with inflation, but Ms Reeves says it will remain at current levels.\nThat will cost the Government £3bn she says, but adds that hiking it “while the cost of living remains high… would be the wrong choice”.\n“I will maintain the existing 5p cut for another year, too. There will be no higher taxes at the petrol pumps next year,” she says.\nNational Insurance\nEmployees have been spared a National Insurance increase but businesses are being asked to “contribute more”, Ms Reeves says.\nThe Chancellor said employers will see their NI contributions rise by 1.2 percentage points, to 15pc, from April.\nShe is also lowering the threshold at which companies start to pay on an employee’s salary, from £9,100 per year to £5,000.\nThe change – which economists have warned will lead to reduced hiring and smaller pay rises – will raise £25bn per year.\n“I know that this is a difficult choice. I do not take this decision lightly,” Ms Reeves said.\nMore than 865,000 small businesses will be exempt under changes to the employment allowance, however, which is rising from £5,000 to £10,500.\nCapital gains tax\nFrom today, Ms Reeves said the lower rate of capital gains tax will rise from 10pc to 18pc, while the higher rate will rise from 20pc to 24pc.\nHowever, she said the rates on property would stay the same while the lifetime limit for business asset disposal relief while remain at £1m.\nThe rate of relief will remain at 10pc this year before rising to 14pc in 2025 and 18pc in 2026.\nAccording to the OBR, the changes will raise £2.5bn.\nMs Reeves says capital gains on so-called carried interest in the fund management also needs to be “fairer”.\nShe says the rate will rise to 32pc in April 2025 and that further reforms will be confirmed in 2026.\nInheritance tax\nMs Reeves says a freeze on inheritance tax thresholds will be extended by two years, to 2030.\nThis means the first £325,000 of any estate can be inherited tax-free, she says, rising to £500,000 if the estate includes a residence passed to direct descendants.\nIt also rises to £1m when a tax free allowance is passed to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\nBut she says inherited pensions will be brought into inheritance tax from April 2027 and that agricultural property relief and business property relief will be “reformed”.\nFrom April 2026, the first £1m of combined business and agricultural assets will not incur inheritance tax but after that it will apply at an effective rate of 20pc.\nTaken together, these measures raise over £2bn in the final year of the forecast.\n“I understand the strongly held desire to pass down savings to children and grandchildren. So I am taking a balanced approach in my package today,” Ms Reeves said.\nAir passenger duty\nAir Passenger Duty has not kept up with inflation in recent years, Ms Reeves says.\nSo she says it will rise by “no more than £2 for an economy class short-haul flight”.\nHowever, for private jets, the rate will increase by 50pc – the equivalent of £450 “per passenger for a private jet to California”.\nAlcohol duty\nDuty on non-draught products will increase in line with retail price inflation from February next year, the Chancellor confirms.\nBut she says two-thirds of alcoholic drinks sold in pubs are served on draught and duty on these products will fall by 1.7pc.\nThis means “a penny off a pint in the pub”.\nTobacco duty\nThe Government will increase tobacco duty by retail price inflation, plus 2pc, every year for the rest of this parliament, Ms Reeves announces.\nFor hand-rolling tobacco, the rate will also rise 10pc this year. And a flat rate duty will be introduced on all vaping liquids from October 2026.\nAlong with annual increases in the soft drinks industry levy, she says the measures will raise nearly £1bn per year by the end of the forecast period.\nStamp duty\nThe stamp-duty land tax surcharge for second-homes, known as the “Higher Rate for Additional Dwellings”, will rise by 2 percentage points to 5pc from Thursday, Ms Reeves confirms.\nThis will “support over 130,000 additional transactions from people buying their first home, or moving home” over the next five years, the Chancellor claims, although she does not spell out how.\nCorporation tax\nToday the Government is publishing a “Corporate Tax Roadmap”, which Ms Reeves claims will “providing the business certainty called for” by business lobby groups the CBI, British Chambers of Commerce and the Institute for Directors.\nIt confirms that corporation tax will remain at 25pc for the duration of this parliament and keeps current expensing reliefs.\nNon-dom regime\n“If you make Britain your home, you should pay your tax here,” Ms Reeves says.\nShe confirms the abolition of the “outdated” non-domicile tax regime from April 2025 and replace it with a “new, residence based scheme” that is “internationally competitive”.\nThe OBR says the package of measures will raise £12.7bn over the next five years.\nIncome tax\nThe previous government froze income tax and National Insurance thresholds repeatedly to raise revenue, drawing more people into higher tax bands, Ms Reeves says.\nBut she says she will not extend this “stealth tax” further, meaning that from 2028-29, personal tax thresholds will be uprated in line with inflation again.\n“When it comes to choices on tax, this government chooses to protect working people every single time,” she says.\nSpending on defence, schools, councils\nMs Reeves says she is increasing the core schools budget by £2.3bn next year, with an extra £300m also pledged for further education and a “tripling” of investment in breakfast clubs.\nSpecial educational needs spending will also rise by 6pc or £1bn from this year.\nAt the same time, Ms Reeves says the defence budget will rise by £2.9bn next year, as ministers chart a path to spending 2.5pc of GDP on defence in the long-term.\n“There is no more important job for government than to keep our country safe,” the Chancellor says.\nLocal government is also getting a funding increase. Ms Reeves announced £1.3bn of extra grant funding for “essential services”, including £600m more for social care and £230m to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.\n“I said there would be no return to austerity, and that is the choice I have made today,” the Chancellor says.\nDownload the full Autumn budget HERE",

These quirky programs, often labeled as “Mickey Mouse degrees,” are raising eyebrows once more. However, the real concern extends beyond these novelty courses. The average university graduate in 2023 is saddled with £45,000 in debt, with the burden only starting to lift once their income surpasses £27,295. Even high earners might find themselves repaying university debt well into middle age, particularly if they’re among the first to benefit from the government’s new “Plan 5” loans, triggering repayments at an income threshold of £25,000.\nBut the real question is: Are these degrees worth the financial sacrifice? A recent study conducted by job website Adzuna has shed light on the degrees that offer the worst value for money in 2023. The findings are particularly troubling for graduates, as they reveal that the value of a degree is being eroded by inflation. In this blog post, we’ll explore the degrees that might be damaging your career prospects and what this means for recent graduates.\nThe Worst Value for Money Degrees\nAdzuna’s research delved into the career trajectories and expected earnings of graduates from various fields five years into their careers. The results exposed ten degrees that provide the worst value for money, with the lowest-ranking course yielding an average salary of just £24,242 five years after graduation. Despite soaring inflation and strong wage growth, advertised salaries have remained stagnant, further compounding the issue.\nPhotography degrees topped the list, with graduates earning an average salary of £24,242 five years post-graduation. Following closely behind were translation (£24,581), criminology (£24,637), and fine art (£25,015). Among these, only fine art graduates could anticipate a slight increase in average salaries from the previous year, with a meager £16 bump.\nThe Unexpected Success Story\nHowever, there are exceptions to this bleak trend. Take Ben Galyas, for instance, who pursued a fine arts degree at Chelsea College of Arts, a constituent of UAL. Despite studying fine arts, he now earns over £100,000 a year plus bonuses in a sales role connecting media and tech businesses. Galyas attributes his success to his ability to articulate complex and abstract concepts, skills he honed during his fine arts education. He explains that fine art degrees are discourse-led, involve minimal dictatorial teaching, and have no exams – qualities that undoubtedly aid in a sales job.\nNotably, Galyas hasn’t completely abandoned his artistic pursuits. He maintains a studio practice, putting on two shows this year alone. This dedication and self-motivation are essential for art graduates who often find themselves with limited corporate job prospects and a competitive arts job market.\nThe Wider Picture\nAdzuna’s research paints a grim picture for university graduates, revealing that 40% of university degrees fail to lead to an average salary above £30,000 within five years – a figure that remains unchanged from the previous year. Shockingly, out of 83 degrees analyzed, 13 didn’t even surpass the student loan repayment threshold within that same period.\nLiz Emreson from the Intergenerational Foundation, a think tank, believes that these stagnant graduate salaries could prompt young jobseekers to seriously consider apprenticeships as an alternative path. She remarks, “These figures paint a depressing picture for young graduates, who were told that going to higher education and taking on debt would bring them a graduate premium. Now it seems that graduates get to keep the debt but not the pay premium promised.”\nConclusion\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of higher education, the debate surrounding the value of certain degrees persists. As students and their families weigh the potential career prospects against the financial costs of pursuing higher education, it’s essential to stay informed about the realities of the job market. While some individuals like Ben Galyas have found unconventional success with “Mickey Mouse degrees,” the broader trends suggest that graduates may need to explore alternative paths to secure their financial future. The days of pursuing a degree for the sake of it may no longer be a viable option for many.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_one-billion-rising-movement/content_139.html": "The Cyprus Mail has reported:\nWhy one billion? Well, that’s the figure of woman and girls across the planet who will be beaten or raped during their lifetime: one third of the entire female population. Yup. One billion. Actually, with world figures on the rise, we’re possibly looking at more than a billion who will become victims of violence. Either way, it’s a horrifying figure.\nNow, while it’s all very well to take a moment to absorb the figures, the truly important thing here is what we’re doing about it. Yes, we. Because this is not something that should be left to the proverbial ‘they’, but an issue which needs to be tackled by all. And that’s why, each February, ordinary people rise to show support for the one billion women (cisgender, transgender, and those who hold fluid identities) who are subject to gender-based violence.\n“Why one billion? Well, that’s the figure of woman and girls across the planet who will be beaten or raped during their lifetime”\nThe biggest mass action to end violence against women in human history, the One Billion Rising campaign began on Valentine’s Day 2012 as a call to action. In countries all over the world (including Cyprus), all genders and nationalities rose, expressing – in the words of campaign managers – “their outrage, and to strike, dance, and RISE in defiance of the injustices women suffer, demanding an end at last to violence against women.”\nThe following year, numbers grew and, by 2014 the movement was highlighting not only the issue of justice for survivors of gender violence, but an escalation in the demand for that justice under the theme of ‘Revolution’. As the years passed, further themes followed, with many of the participating countries encouraged to fine-tune the topic to local issues. By 2017, the general call was to “rise in solidarity against the exploitation of women and girls”, while 2018 saw people the world over showing support for the most marginalised members of society – “working class, minority and women on the margins in every part of the globe” – under the banner ‘Rise, Resist, Unite’.\nNow, if all this sounds a bit hairy, let us set your mind at ease. One Billion Rising is a totally peaceful movement, a celebration of our collective strength when we unite under the banner of change. In over 120 countries, everyday people unite with public figures to march through the streets in a peaceful, almost celebratory manner, demanding an end to violence against women. And that includes Cyprus where, for the past few years, we’ve joined in the One Billion Rising events with a march in Nicosia from Phaneromeni Square, down Onasagorou Street, and back to the starting point.\nTaking place on February 10 this year, with people gathering in the square at 11am, the event falls – as always – under the auspices of the Cyprus Women’s Lobby. But while, in 2018, the theme was rising against sexual exploitation, 2019 will see participants gathering under the banner of violence against women by their husbands and intimate partners.\n“We cannot ignore the facts,” says Maria Epaminonda, Vice-President of the Board of Directors of the Cyprus Women’s Lobby. “One in 3 women across the world will face violence in her lifetime, either physical, psychological or sexual. And, according to World Health Organisation, at least 30 per cent of these women will experience this violence at the hands of an intimate partner or relative.” If you’re thinking here the statistics probably don’t apply to the more developed nations, you’d be wrong. According to a 2014 study by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights “one in five women across the 28 States of the European Union has experienced physical and/or sexual violence from a partner.”\n“There is a great need to create awareness of the impact and consequences which violence has on a woman’s life,” Maria adds. “And we need to remind each and every person that we can all provide help or support when it’s requested or when an opportunity is just given to us. We need to act in solidarity, to call upon the state to protect each and every woman from violence; we shouldn’t turn our heads away. Last year,” she concludes, “we saw 250 people in Cyprus marching in support of the One Billion Rising campaign. This year, let your voice be heard: every person counts. Make it 251. We’ll see you there!”\nOne Billion Rising\nStarts in Phaneromeni Square at 11am, February 10. for more information visit the Facebook page ‘One Billion Rising 2019’ Women in need of help and support can call the 1440 Helpline (Association for the Prevention and Handling of Violence in the Family)\nCOMMENT\nThis is a movement that needs everyone’s support, violence is actually increasing and sexually motivate attacks are also on the increase. The UK has a law to help protect people (male and female as the figures for attacks on men are only slightly less) called “Claire’s Law” it is crucial that people are educated in how to check if potential partners have a history of violence, or any form of abuse. It is also crucial that NOBODY feels that they should suffer in silence, this is a noble cause and we should all support it.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-high-price-of-settling-for-less-britains-troubling-path-away-from-growth/content_146.html": "The High Price of Settling for Less – Britain’s Troubling Path Away from Growth\n**Introduction: The Echoes of Complacency**\nIn 1984, Margaret Thatcher’s words resonated as a cautionary tale about Britain’s reluctance to embrace economic freedom. She decried the use of “sedative phrases” and the complacency that threatened to plunge the nation into irreversible decline. Today, as we analyze Britain’s economic landscape, it’s evident that history is repeating itself. Recent GDP figures offer a glimmer of hope, but the underlying trends indicate a disconcerting aversion to sustainable growth.\n**The Illusion of Progress: Numbers Tell the Story**\nWhile a 0.5% GDP growth rate in June might spark optimism, the reality is tempered by the larger picture: a mere 0.2% growth for the entire second quarter. The concerning aspect is that avoiding a recession has somehow become a noteworthy achievement. Moreover, when compared to lackluster social-democratic European counterparts, this marginal outperformance loses its sheen. It begs the question: why is Britain settling for an illusion of “stability” at the expense of genuine economic progress?\n**Anti-Growth Forces Unleashed: A Silent Coalition**\nToday’s anti-growth coalition is broader than we might realize. Extreme environmentalists advocate for “degrowth” as a positive path, while socialists prioritize slicing the economic pie over expanding it. Regulatory bodies and bureaucrats, meanwhile, work to minimize risk-taking, stifling the entrepreneurial spirit. The aftermath of recent lockdowns has only deepened the attachment to state support, diverting focus from self-reliance.\n**Conservative Aversion to Change: The Stagnation Quandary**\nEven among conservatives, there seems to be an inclination to shy away from transformative change. Lessons from past reform efforts appear to have cemented the belief that the public resists any form of change. As a result, the energy that could be directed toward meaningful reform is instead invested in improving the efficiency of the status quo. However, this approach comes with a steep and unsustainable price.\n**The Unsustainable Trajectory: A Harsh Reality**\nThe current trajectory Britain is on is financially untenable. Despite burdensome taxes, the government continues to accrue substantial debt to uphold unreformed public services. Debt interest is ballooning uncontrollably. The weight of public sector pensions compounds the financial burden, all while a significant portion of the working-age population remains detached from the workforce. For the younger generation, this raises a poignant question: why invest in a system that seemingly perpetuates inefficiency?\n**Cultural Factors: Entrepreneurship Undermined**\nIn the United States, entrepreneurial ventures are hailed, and self-employment is a symbol of autonomy. In stark contrast, the UK has begun to vilify profit-making, often branding it as exploitative. This cultural shift adds to the environment of stagnation, pushing the country further away from its growth potential.\n**London’s Resilience Amidst Decline**\nWhile London retains its competitive edge, particularly in finance, the rest of the nation falls short in comparison to global standards. The argument that an aging population inherently stifles dynamism and propels reliance on public services is a rationalization of political inertia. Just as in the debate surrounding net-zero, where select Conservatives challenge established consensus, voters appreciate leaders who address the truth head-on.\n**The Waiting Game: Citizens’ Call for Action**\nThe citizens of Britain are far from gullible. They understand that a “quiet life” comes at a cost. The pertinent question is: how long will they tolerate leaders who perpetuate this compromise? The populace hungers for visionary leaders who champion growth, economic resilience, and a commitment to prosperity over transient stability. Britain’s potential hinges on the courage of leaders to shatter the chains of complacency and guide the nation toward a future marked by authentic growth, vitality, and hope.\n**Conclusion**\nAs the echoes of history reverberate, it becomes increasingly evident that Britain stands at a crossroads. The allure of a “quiet life” comes at a steep price – a price that threatens to burden future generations with insurmountable debt and economic stagnation. The mere avoidance of recession, while touted as an accomplishment, falls far short of the aspirations that a nation with such a rich history should strive for.\nThe anti-growth coalition, composed of various factions, has united to create a perfect storm of complacency. From extreme environmentalists advocating “degrowth” to bureaucrats stifling risk-taking, this coalition has pushed Britain further away from its potential. Even among conservatives, a hesitation to challenge the status quo only prolongs this unsustainable trajectory.\nThe financial landscape is bleak, with high taxes failing to mitigate soaring debt interest and looming public sector pension liabilities. The younger generation, in particular, questions the rationale behind investing their efforts in a system that seems destined to perpetuate inefficiency.\nCultural shifts have also played a role, undermining the entrepreneurial spirit that propels innovation and growth. The contrast with the United States, where entrepreneurship is celebrated, highlights the need for a mindset shift within Britain.\nLondon’s resilience in certain sectors cannot mask the broader decline that much of the nation faces. The prevailing narrative of an aging population leading to diminished dynamism is a self-fulfilling prophecy, perpetuated by political timidity.\nIn the face of these challenges, the citizens of Britain yearn for leadership that is unafraid to embrace growth, economic resilience, and a commitment to progress. The path forward requires a departure from the complacency that has taken hold and a bold embrace of the dynamic spirit that Britain is known for.\nUltimately, Britain’s potential is limitless, and its destiny is in the hands of leaders willing to challenge the status quo. The time has come to break free from the shackles of settled-for mediocrity and steer the nation towards a future marked by sustained growth, renewed vitality, and a promise of prosperity for all. It is only by doing so that Britain can reclaim its rightful place on the global stage and secure a better tomorrow for generations to come.",

If the Greek-Jewish prisoners refused, they would be killed. It was nightfall when the men were informed of the impossible task they were expected to fulfill the next day. After a long debate about the Nazis’ demand, about the morality of it all, and about the meaning of life and death, the prisoners voted on whether they would fulfill the task or willfully be killed. Piroska reveals that she was one of the few Hungarian prisoners to survive and she witnessed the 446 men make their stunning choice.\nELEFTHEROMANI from David Antoniuk on Vimeo.\nOne of the most awarded and recognized Greek-themed short films in history that tells a relatively unknown story from the Holocaust era has been released online and is available for global streaming. The film, titled “Eleftheromania,” has been symbolically released to global audiences on International Holocaust Remembrance Day 2021.\nThe film’s entire team decided collectively that such a story needs to be available for generations to come to recall the heroism of more than 400 Greek prisoners who defied the Nazis while they were imprisoned in Auschwitz.\nThe film tells the story of a group of courageous Greeks, who were given impossible orders by their Nazi captors and is based on four years of research and trips to Berlin and Poland by Gregory C. Pappas who uncovered the story of these Greek prisoners who arrived at the death camp in June of 1944.\nIn addition to finding first-hand evidence of their story, Pappas also scoured archives at Auschwitz and found records and testimony about this remarkable act of defiance.\nJoanna Tsanis wrote the screenplay and produced the film, together with Pappas and Toronto-based producer Chuck Scott. The 20-minute film was shot in Toronto and New York City and directed by award-winning Canadian director David Antoniuk.\nAcademy Award-winning actor Olympia Dukakis plays an elderly survivor being interviewed by New York-born actress Anthoula Katsimatides, who plays a journalist that helps Dukakis’ character recount the horrors of the camp.\nGreek singer Glykeria recorded a special version of the song “Minore Tis Avgis” for the closing credits of the song.\nEleftheromania was recognized with distinction at dozens of screenings and film festivals throughout the world, winning Best Drama at the prestigious Toronto Shorts International Film Festival and being an Official Selection at the Raindance Festival in London.\nThe film also won the support of the prestigious Nick Mirkopoulos Canadian Content Initiative, a Cinespace Film Studios program that recognizes the life of the company’s founder through financial and other support to worthy projects.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_net-zero-policies-causing-energy-crisis/content_1165.html": "Net Zero policies causing energy crisis\nEnergy Crisis Looms as Britain Faces Critical Power Shortages Amid Freezing Temperatures\nBritain faced a severe energy crisis this week as temperatures plummeted to potentially -20°C, raising serious concerns about the nation’s power infrastructure and energy policies. The situation became particularly acute when the National Grid’s spare electricity capacity dropped to a precarious 580 megawatts at 5:30 PM on Wednesday, a margin so thin that experts warned even a minor power station outage could have triggered widespread blackouts.\nThe crisis highlighted significant challenges in Britain’s energy strategy, particularly regarding renewable energy sources. While the current administration has championed wind power, its contribution to the national energy mix stood at just 9%, with gas generation accounting for 55% of electricity production. The situation became so critical that two power stations, Rye House and Connah’s Quay, were paid a combined £12 million to provide just three hours of electricity during peak evening demand.\nAdding to the growing concerns, the Bank of England has recently acknowledged that Net Zero policies are contributing to rising inflation and escalating energy prices. This admission comes at a particularly sensitive time, as the UK Health Security Agency issued an alert warning about the severe health implications of cold weather, particularly for those aged 65 and over and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.\nThe current energy strategy has drawn criticism for its ambitious timeline to achieve 95% green energy within five years. Critics argue that the technology required for such a transition isn’t sufficiently developed, pointing to the limitations of renewable energy sources. A telling example from last year saw energy companies paying over £1 billion to wind farms to cease operations during periods of excess wind, as the National Grid couldn’t handle the load.\nThe nuclear energy debate has also resurfaced, with advocates pointing to France’s model of extensive nuclear power plant construction as a potential solution for reducing reliance on renewable sources. Recent developments have seen one nuclear power station coming online, capable of providing energy for millions of homes, though experts suggest several more would be needed to meet national demand.\nFinancial implications of the energy crisis extend to household costs, with comparisons to international markets highlighting the severity of Britain’s situation. While US energy costs rose by approximately 6% last year and 14% since the end of COVID-19, British consumers have seen their costs nearly double. The US has simultaneously increased its market share of LNG supply to Britain from 22% to 50% following disruptions to European gas supplies.\nThe crisis has also sparked debate about the disconnect between policy makers and those most affected by energy policies. Critics point to the financial security of political leaders as potentially influencing their approach to energy policy, arguing that those making decisions about the nation’s energy future may be insulated from the immediate impacts of their choices.\nThe situation raises particular concerns about vulnerable populations, with health experts warning about increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, and chest infections among elderly and vulnerable people during cold temperatures. The removal of certain heating benefits, combined with rising energy costs, has amplified these concerns.\nAs Britain grapples with these immediate challenges, questions persist about the feasibility of current green energy targets and their economic impact. While long-term environmental planning remains crucial, the immediate needs for reliable, affordable energy supply have brought the timeline and implementation of Net Zero policies under increased scrutiny.\nThe crisis underscores the delicate balance between environmental ambitions and practical necessities, particularly during extreme weather conditions when reliable energy supply becomes literally a matter of life and death for vulnerable populations. As temperatures continue to drop, the adequacy of Britain’s energy infrastructure and the wisdom of its rapid transition to renewable sources remain subjects of intense debate.\nSummary Conclusion\n* Britain’s Energy Security Crisis:\n– National Grid’s spare capacity dropped to dangerous levels of just 580 megawatts\n– Gas currently generates 55% of electricity while wind contributes only 9%\n– Emergency measures cost £12 million for just three hours of power supply\n* Economic Impact:\n– Bank of England confirms Net Zero policies are driving inflation\n– UK energy costs have nearly doubled since COVID-19\n– Significant contrast with US markets, where costs rose only 6% last year\n– Growing dependence on US LNG imports, now at 50% of supply\n* Policy Challenges:\n– Target of 95% green energy within five years faces serious feasibility questions\n– Infrastructure limitations exposed by paying wind farms £1 billion to cease operations\n– Nuclear power debate intensifies, with calls for more nuclear stations\n– Questions about the balance between environmental goals and practical energy needs\n* Public Health Concerns:\n– Severe weather warnings with temperatures dropping to -20°C\n– Particular risks for elderly and vulnerable populations\n– Increased likelihood of heart attacks, strokes, and chest infections\n– Removal of heating benefits compounds vulnerability\n* Strategic Considerations:\n– Need for better alignment between environmental ambitions and energy security\n– Questions about the pace of renewable energy transition\n– Growing debate about the role of nuclear power in the energy mix\n– Concerns about disconnect between policy makers and affected populations\nThese developments highlight the urgent need for a more balanced approach to energy policy that considers immediate security needs alongside long-term environmental goals.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_mass-migration-has-fundamentally-altered-britain/content_844.html": "Mass Migration Has Fundamentally Altered Britain\nDavid Starkey explains in Controversial Interview\nIn a wide-ranging and provocative interview, renowned historian David Starkey has offered a stark assessment of the impact of mass migration on British society, arguing that it has irrevocably changed the country he once knew. Starkey, known for his outspoken views and expertise in Tudor history, delved into a range of contentious issues surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and national identity in modern Britain.\nRecent Unrest and the Spectre of Civil Conflict\nAddressing the recent protests and riots that have rocked various parts of the UK, Starkey dismissed tech mogul Elon Musk’s prediction of an inevitable civil war. However, he painted a concerning picture of Britain’s future, forecasting “sustained interethnic conflict” and escalating clashes between various ethnic and religious groups. The historian suggested that while full-scale civil war might not be on the horizon, the country faces a period of significant social turbulence.\n“What we’re going to see is increasing clashes between ethnic groups,” Starkey warned. “Hindu and Pakistani, Hindu Muslim, and I’m afraid between whites and everybody else.” This grim prediction underscores Starkey’s belief that Britain’s social fabric is under severe strain due to rapid demographic changes and what he perceives as failed integration policies.\nThe Silencing of Debate\nStarkey levelled sharp criticism at what he describes as a longstanding policy of “enforced silence” on issues of immigration and integration. He traced this approach back to the aftermath of Enoch Powell’s infamous “Rivers of Blood” speech in 1968, arguing that while Powell’s language may have been “overblown”, the points he raised have proven prescient.\n“There’s been a deliberate attempt ever since Enoch Powell’s ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech… to shut people up,” Starkey contended. He argued that this suppression of open debate has allowed societal tensions to fester, likening it to “a sore in the body” or “an untreated wound” that deepens and becomes “more and more septic until finally it bursts horribly to the surface”.\nThis metaphor reflects Starkey’s belief that by avoiding frank discussions about immigration and its impacts, British society has allowed problems to accumulate unchecked, leading to the current state of unrest and division.\nA Lost Britain?\nReflecting on his youth, Starkey painted a nostalgic picture of the Britain he grew up in, describing it as “the most peaceful, the most gentle homogeneous society that has ever existed”. He spoke of a time characterised by high levels of public trust, low crime rates, and a sense of shared national identity.\n“We did not need identity cards,” Starkey reminisced. “There were extraordinarily low levels of crime, such high levels of public trust.” This idyllic portrayal serves as a stark contrast to his view of contemporary Britain, which he sees as fragmented and riven with tension.\nStarkey contended that this society has been “deliberately destroyed” by Tony Blair and New Labour’s policies on multiculturalism and mass immigration. He accused Blair’s government of having “an absurd notion that they were going to force us to become multiethnic for our good” and of deliberately trying to “rub the noses of the whites in the dirt”.\nThe Scale of Change\nThe historian expressed particular concern about the scale of immigration to the UK since 1997, describing it as “unique throughout our history” in terms of numbers. “The scale of millions since 1997, it’s not simply unique in modern times, it’s unique throughout our history,” Starkey asserted. He argued that even the great population movements of the Roman period and the so-called Barbarian invasions pale in comparison to the demographic changes Britain has experienced in recent decades.\nStarkey contended that this unprecedented influx, coupled with what he sees as a suppression of debate, has exacerbated societal tensions and led to the current state of unrest. He criticised the way in which this demographic shift has been managed, arguing that it has been done “without consent” and “with a deliberate suppression of debate about it”.\nPolitical Failings\nStarkey was scathing in his criticism of both major political parties, accusing Labour of abandoning its traditional white working-class base and the Conservatives of failing to address the consequences of mass immigration. He argued that the Labour Party has “ceased to be the party of the working class” and instead become “the party of the rampantly powerful, entitled public sector”.\nThe historian was particularly critical of Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour leadership, describing the new Prime Minister as “wooden” and “dull” compared to Tony Blair. He accused Starmer of immediately resorting to “the iron fist” and the “language of the policeman”, contrasting this with Blair’s ability to empathise with and appeal to a broad spectrum of voters.\nRegarding the Conservative Party, Starkey lamented its failure to alter what he called the “dreadful constitutional changes” implemented by Labour, which he believes have embedded problematic attitudes towards borders, human rights, and national identity.\nA Call for Integration\nStarkey called for a reaffirmation of British values and institutions, arguing that all immigrant groups should be required to embrace these unconditionally. He advocated for a return to what he sees as the essence of Englishness: “the commitment to the institutions of the free, responsible, liberal parliamentary state”.\n“We cannot have groups saying we are different, we are going to remain isolated, we do not approve of you,” Starkey insisted. He argued for stricter immigration policies, including ending citizenship rights for arranged marriages and outlawing cousin marriages, which he claims perpetuate cultural isolation.\nThe Need for Open Debate\nThroughout the interview, Starkey emphasised the need for open and honest debate on these issues. He criticised what he perceives as an overuse of terms like “racist” and “far-right” to shut down discussion, arguing that this approach has contributed to the current state of societal tension.\n“The term racist has become absurd,” Starkey contended. He argued that his critiques were not aimed at immigrants themselves, many of whom he praised for making “remarkable contributions” to British society. Instead, he focused on what he sees as failed policies and the suppression of necessary debates.\nHistorical Parallels and Future Challenges\nLooking to the future, Starkey drew parallels with past periods of social change in British history, such as the reforms of the 19th century. He argued that Britain now faces the challenge of repeating that process of reintegration and incorporation for new immigrant communities.\n“We’ve got to try to revive that conservative notion, that notion that the way we always did things, the thing that enabled England uniquely, Britain uniquely of any European country in the 19th century, to modernise and to incorporate all these different social groups without vast unrest and revolution,” Starkey said.\nHe warned that failure to achieve this reintegration could lead to further social unrest and potentially open the door to extremist politics on both the right and left. Starkey called for a return to what he sees as traditional British values of free speech, parliamentary democracy, and gradual, considered reform.\nConclusion\nStarkey’s comments are likely to provoke intense debate and controversy, touching on sensitive issues of national identity, immigration, and multiculturalism in modern Britain. While his views will undoubtedly be challenged by many, they reflect ongoing tensions and debates within British society about the nature of integration, the pace of demographic change, and the future of national identity in an increasingly diverse country.\nAs Britain continues to grapple with these complex issues, Starkey’s interview serves as a reminder of the deep divisions and passionate debates that surround questions of immigration and national identity in the 21st century. Whether one agrees with his assessment or not, it is clear that these issues will remain at the forefront of British political and social discourse for years to come.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_keir-starmers-war-on-pensioners-continues/content_206.html": "Keir Starmer’s war on pensioners continues\nPensioners Protest: Keir Starmer’s Controversial Policies Spark Outrage\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has found himself at the centre of a growing controversy over his party’s proposed policies affecting the elderly. Critics argue that these measures could potentially push millions of pensioners into poverty and isolation.\nThe most contentious issue is Labour’s refusal to rule out scrapping the single person council tax discount, a policy that currently provides a 25% reduction in council tax for those living alone. This discount is particularly crucial for elderly widows and the estimated 4 million pensioners who live by themselves across the UK. Many view this discount as a vital lifeline for those on fixed incomes.\nAdding fuel to the fire is Labour’s already announced plan to cut winter fuel payments for a significant portion of pensioners. This decision has been met with widespread criticism, with opponents arguing that it could have severe consequences for the most vulnerable members of society.\nDuring a recent parliamentary session, Sir Keir was pressed on these issues. When questioned about the potential scrapping of concessionary travel fares and council tax discounts for pensioners, he declined to provide a definitive answer, stating that he wouldn’t “pre-empt the budget”. This response has only served to intensify concerns among elderly advocacy groups and opposition parties.\nThe situation was further complicated when a government spokesperson later attempted to clarify the position on free bus passes, assuring the public that they would not be scrapped. However, this statement has done little to allay fears, given Sir Keir’s history of changing positions on various issues, including Brexit, taxes on working people, and border security.\nOne of the most alarming aspects of this controversy is Labour’s refusal to publish a risk assessment report on the impact of cutting winter fuel payments. This has led to speculation that the party may be attempting to conceal potentially damaging information. A previous Labour Party analysis suggested that similar policies could result in nearly 4,000 deaths.\nIn defence of the government’s position, a minister argued that the decision to stabilise the economy allows for a commitment to the triple lock on pensions, ensuring higher state pension payments. However, critics remain unconvinced, pointing out that this doesn’t negate the potential harm caused by removing other forms of support.\nThe debate has also touched on broader issues of government transparency. There are growing calls for the release of data on welfare payments to migrants and the details of a reported £22 billion financial deficit that is being used to justify these policy changes.\nRecent surveys paint a grim picture of the potential impact of these policies on the elderly. A significant percentage of older people report that they would be forced to reduce heating in their homes, cut back on essentials, or eat less if winter fuel payments were reduced or eliminated. This has led to accusations that the Labour Party is prioritising other spending areas, such as international climate finance and support for train drivers, over the wellbeing of pensioners.\nLord Bailey, a Conservative peer, described the proposed changes as “wicked”, particularly criticising the speed at which they are being implemented. He argued that the lack of notice given to older people to prepare for these changes is particularly cruel.\nDefenders of the Labour position, including former party advisor Matthew Lza, argue that difficult decisions must be made in government. They point to previous welfare cuts implemented by Conservative governments, such as the two-child benefit cap and the controversial “bedroom tax”, suggesting that opposition to such measures is often selective.\nHowever, critics maintain that there is a crucial difference when it comes to policies affecting pensioners. Unlike other groups, pensioners have no ability to increase their income, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in support systems.\nThe controversy has also reignited discussions about the wealth disparity between political leaders and the general public. Sir Keir Starmer, reportedly a millionaire, has faced questions about whether he is out of touch with the financial realities faced by ordinary pensioners.\nAs the debate continues, there are growing calls for greater transparency from the Labour Party. Many are demanding the release of detailed calculations behind the reported financial deficit and a clear explanation of how proposed policies will impact different segments of society.\nThe situation remains fluid, with the Labour Party under increasing pressure to clarify its position on various policies affecting the elderly. As pensioners and advocacy groups continue to voice their concerns, it remains to be seen how Sir Keir Starmer and his team will respond to the mounting criticism and whether they will reconsider their approach to supporting the UK’s ageing population.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_keir-starmer-authorises-use-of-british-missiles-for-strikes-on-russian-territory/content_1242.html": "Keir Starmer Authorises Use of British Missiles for Strikes on Russian Territory\nIn a significant shift from the previous Conservative government’s stance, Sir Keir Starmer, the newly elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has granted permission for British-supplied missiles to be employed in defensive strikes against targets within Russian territory. This momentous decision was unveiled during Sir Keir’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the NATO summit in Washington DC on Wednesday.\nThe announcement, which has been warmly received by Ukraine, marks a notable departure from the more cautious approach adopted by the former Tory administration. The missiles in question are the highly advanced Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which possess a range of over 250 kilometres and are capable of striking targets deep behind enemy lines.\nJohn Healey, the newly appointed Defence Secretary, addressed the matter whilst speaking to Sky News. Whilst refraining from delving into specific “operational arrangements”, Mr Healey emphasised the UK’s commitment to supporting Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression. He stated, “We will do all we can to help Ukraine in their fight to repel Putin’s invasion.” This resolute stance underscores the Labour government’s determination to stand firmly alongside Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia.\nDuring his address in Washington, Mr Healey further elucidated the UK’s position, stating, “We provide weapons equipment where we can for them to defend themselves, and as we do for ourselves and any other nation in conflict, we require, because it’s international law, that war is conducted within those rules of the Geneva Convention.” This statement serves to reassure both domestic and international observers that the UK’s support for Ukraine remains firmly within the bounds of international law and established rules of engagement.\nPrime Minister Starmer, speaking on the matter, emphasised that the military aid would be utilised “in accordance with international humanitarian law”. He further clarified, “It is for defensive purposes, but it is for Ukraine to decide how to deploy it for those defensive purposes. I don’t mean to get into a discussion here, as you would imagine, all targeting that would be inappropriate, but that is the position.” This stance affords Ukraine a degree of autonomy in its defensive strategy whilst maintaining the UK’s commitment to ethical warfare.\nThe Ukrainian President took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to express his gratitude following the meeting with Sir Keir. President Zelenskyy wrote, “This morning, I learned about the permission to use Storm Shadow missiles against military targets in Russian territory. Today we had the opportunity to discuss the practical implementation of this decision. I’m grateful to the UK for its unwavering support for Ukraine and our people.” This message not only confirms the decision but also highlights the strong diplomatic ties between the UK and Ukraine.\nHowever, the announcement has predictably drawn criticism from Moscow. Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, responded to the news with a stern warning. Speaking to Reuters, Peskov stated, “If this is so then, of course, this is another absolutely irresponsible step towards escalating tensions and seriously escalating the situation.” He added ominously, “We will be watching this very thoroughly and respond accordingly.” This reaction underscores the potential for increased tensions between Russia and the West as a result of this decision.\nThe NATO Summit: A Multilayered Gathering\nThe announcement regarding the Storm Shadow missiles formed just one facet of a multifaceted NATO summit. The gathering, which brings together leaders from the alliance’s 32 member states, is set to conclude on Thursday and marks the 75th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nIn a comprehensive declaration, NATO members reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine’s future within the alliance. The carefully worded statement asserted, “We fully support Ukraine’s right to choose its own security arrangements and decide its own future, free from outside interference. Ukraine’s future is in NATO.” This unequivocal support for Ukraine’s NATO aspirations is likely to further aggravate Moscow, which has long opposed the expansion of the alliance eastward.\nThe declaration continued, “As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. We reaffirm that we will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met.” This statement strikes a delicate balance between reassuring Ukraine of NATO’s commitment whilst acknowledging the complexities involved in the membership process.\nUK’s Role in NATO and Support for Ukraine\nDefence Secretary John Healey emphasised the UK’s ambition to be “the leading European nation in NATO” and stressed the importance of taking a leading role in supporting Ukraine. In a rare display of cross-party continuity regarding weapons supply to Ukraine, Mr Healey remarked, “The Sunak pledge comes with the Starmer guarantee of delivery.” This statement underscores the bipartisan nature of the UK’s support for Ukraine, transcending changes in government.\nWhen questioned about the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency in the United States, Mr Healey offered a carefully measured response. He acknowledged the potential shift in American priorities, stating, “Whoever is elected to the White House, we have to recognise that the American priorities are likely to shift increasingly to the Indo-Pacific and to other parts of the globe.” He went on to explain the implications of this shift, saying, “The consequences of that are the European nations in NATO must do more of the heavy lifting and some of the leadership that traditionally we’ve been able to look to the Americans to do.”\nThis assessment aligns with private discussions among Washington-based European diplomats, who speak more candidly about the potential impact of a Trump return to the White House. These sources suggest that the existing gradual rebalancing of power within NATO could transform into a more dramatic shift away from US dominance of the alliance should Trump secure a second term.\nConcerns Over US Leadership\nThe NATO summit has been overshadowed by growing concerns regarding US President Joe Biden’s agility and perceived cognitive decline. These concerns were further amplified by a call from George Clooney, a friend and significant donor to Biden, for the president to step aside as the Democratic candidate for the upcoming election.\nIn response to these mounting pressures, Senate Democrats are scheduled to have lunch with top Biden advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, as well as the Biden-Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon. This meeting comes just hours before President Biden is set to give a rare news conference to conclude the NATO summit, which will undoubtedly serve as a crucial test of his capabilities.\nDespite these concerns, President Biden appeared composed during his meeting with Prime Minister Starmer in the Oval Office. While the president looked tired, he managed to avoid any notable gaffes or missteps during the encounter. This meeting occurred midway through Sir Keir’s visit to Washington, which UK diplomatic sources have described as a resounding success.\nThe timing of the NATO summit has proven fortuitous for the new British administration, allowing the three top ministers to meet with many of their respective counterparts in one location during their first week in office. Sir Keir, accompanied by Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey, made frequent appearances as a trio and visited Capitol Hill, where they met with leaders from both sides of the political divide.\nIn conclusion, the decision to allow the use of British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for strikes on Russian territory marks a significant shift in UK foreign policy. This move, coupled with the strong show of support for Ukraine at the NATO summit, demonstrates the new Labour government’s commitment to standing firm against Russian aggression. However, it also raises questions about the potential for escalation in the ongoing conflict and the changing dynamics within the NATO alliance. As the situation continues to evolve, the international community will be closely watching the repercussions of this bold stance by the UK and its NATO allies.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cyprus-cannot-cope-with-the-number-of-immigrants/content_244.html": "A total of 3,060 migrants have crossed from the occupied areas into the republic so far this year asking for political asylum, Interior Minister Constantinos Petrides said on Friday. Talking to the Cyprus News Agency, he said the situation has accelerated since 2018 and the problem is extremely serious.\n“In only one month, from May 2 until June 2,744 have crossed. In 2017 there were 138, during the whole of 2018 there were 2,625 and this year, by June 2, 3,060,” he said.\nMost of them are men and they come in large groups “so it is definitely organised. There are groups from several different countries, so we are definitely talking about networks. There are Syrians as well as people from other nationalities which did not exist in the past, from African countries such as Cameroon and Nigeria, reportedly arriving by air at Tymbou airport.”\nIt is possible that even the authorities in the north act as traffickers, he added. The refugees themselves talk about the existence of networks, Petrides added, but the Republic of Cyprus cannot do anything about the situation because these are territories not under control of the republic.\nAccording to the interior minister, the EU has been informed by the President and it will be addressed directly to the UN.\n“We are also examining the practical application of the Green Line Regulation and what this implies.”\nAsked what he means by this, he replied “Let’s just leave it at that.”\nThere is some help from the EU, but the reception centre where the migrants are registered is overflowing and with the growing numbers it is “extremely difficult if not impossible to deal with the problem.”\nSince most of the asylum seekers come from war-torn countries such as Syria, their application for political asylum is usually granted, but the country cannot deal with housing and supplying workplaces for so many people. The big problem and the difference between Cyprus and other EU member states is that the refugees come from the uncontrolled areas, Petrides reiterated.\n“This is why we ask for practical support from the EU. Turkey and the pseudo-state should not have the right to use migrants for political purposes in this way.”\nCOMMENT\nWe are constantly told that these are Syrian refugees, yet most of the immigrants who are here are NOT from Syria. Turkey is waving them through and that is not without agenda. During WW11, Hitler airdropped currency over the UK to destroy the British economy, it was called Operation Bernhard. I feel that these people are being dumped in Cyprus ‘en mass’ to wreak destruction. Hundreds of residential blocks have already been turned in to ghettos and this is just the beginning.\nThis is not giving safe haven, this is not the first safe country they have reached (as required by international law) they are people who have been shopped here WITH INTENT. Cyprus cannot cope with these numbers, Europe cannot cope with these numbers, we are constantly lied to about the numbers who arrive, they use every possible means to deceive us, anything from only counting the head of the family, to holding them in one country, (Cyprus for example) until they are granted Citizenship, they can them migrate AS EUROPEANS thereby distorting the figures.\nEUROPE IS UNDER ATTACK, WE ARE UNDER ATTACK, THIS IS POPULATION REPLACEMENT ON A GRAND SCALE!",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-arab-spring-a-decade-later/content_830.html": "The Arab Spring a decade later\n“A Decade After the Arab Spring: Tunisia’s Unique Journey”\nThe Arab Spring, a series of uprisings that shook the Arab world, began its tumultuous journey a decade ago in Tunisia. This historic movement triggered a wave of change across the region, but not all stories of transformation were the same. In this blog post, we’ll delve into what happened after the Arab Spring, with a focus on Tunisia, often hailed as a relative success amidst the challenges.\nThe Spark that Ignited the Arab Spring\nIn December 2010, a 26-year-old Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohammed Bouazizi found himself at the center of a tragic turning point. The police attempted to confiscate his cart, alleging a lack of permit. However, Bouazizi claimed that the officers demanded a bribe, and a policewoman even resorted to physical violence. When he sought justice from local officials, he was met with indifference. In an act of extreme desperation, he set himself on fire, a desperate cry for help.\nBouazizi’s tragic death struck a chord with many Tunisians who were also grappling with systemic frustrations. This poignant event ignited protests across the country, reflecting the power of the most powerless challenging the mightiest. Across the Middle East and North Africa, people were inspired to demand change in their own nations.\nThe Arab Spring Across Borders\nThe Arab Spring’s effects rippled across the region, resulting in diverse outcomes:\n1. **Tunisia**: The 23-year reign of President Ben Ali was swiftly ended by just a month of protests. Tunisia embarked on a path of political transition, drafting a new constitution, holding elections, and nurturing a relatively free media. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet in 2015 for their efforts towards national reconciliation.\n2. **Egypt**: After 18 days of protests, President Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule ended. Egypt saw its first democratically elected President, Mohammed Morsi, but the military later assumed control.\n3. **Libya**: Muammar Gaddafi’s 42-year regime was toppled, leading to a power vacuum and an ongoing civil war.\n4. **Yemen**: President Ali Abdullah Saleh was ousted after 33 years, but the country remained divided, facing severe humanitarian crises due to ongoing conflict.\n5. **Syria**: Bashar al-Assad, despite prolonged protests, retained power. What began as peaceful demonstrations spiraled into one of the most devastating conflicts in recent history.\nWhile some countries saw political upheaval, others like Bahrain experienced uprisings that were ultimately suppressed with external assistance, notably from Saudi Arabia.\nTunisia: A Complex Transition\nTunisia’s journey since the Arab Spring is complex. While it has made significant strides in terms of democracy and accountability, it faces numerous challenges. Political elites from the previous regime have returned to power, hampering efforts to address past corruption.\nSecurity issues persist, with spillover violence from Libya and attacks on civilians. Economic difficulties have led to mass protests and a nationwide strike, reflecting the struggles of everyday Tunisians.\nIt’s challenging to label Tunisia a complete success, but it’s equally hard to ignore the progress it has made compared to many other Arab Spring countries. Transformation takes time, and Tunisia’s story is a testament to that.\nThe Arab Spring’s Ongoing Influence\nTen years on, the Arab Spring’s spirit continues to influence nations across the region. Countries like Sudan, Algeria, and Lebanon have witnessed renewed protests and demands for change. The barriers of fear that were broken a decade ago have emboldened citizens to hold their governments accountable.\nIn conclusion, Tunisia’s unique journey post-Arab Spring reflects the complexities of political transformation. While it has made commendable progress, challenges persist, reminding us that true change takes time. The Arab Spring may have started in Tunisia, but its echoes resonate far and wide, continuing to shape the destiny of nations in the Middle East and North Africa.",

We want an education system that ensures young people learn the skills, character and values to succeed in life.\nCritical reforms needed in the first 100 days:\nBan Transgender Ideology in Primary and Secondary Schools.\nThere are 2 sexes and 2 genders. It is a dangerous safeguarding issue to confuse children by suggesting otherwise. No gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping. Inform parents of under 16s about their children’s life decisions. Schools must have single sex facilities.\nBan Critical Race Theory in Primary and Secondary Schools.\nIt is unacceptable to divide children on grounds of race and teach them to be ashamed of their country.\nTax relief of 20% on all Independent Education.\nNo VAT on Fees: If parents can afford to pay a bit more, we should incentivise them to choose independent schools. This will significantly ease pressure on state schools, so improve education for all. Independent education capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs.\nScrap Interest on Student Loans.\nExtend loan capital repayment periods to 45 years. Restrict undergraduate numbers well below current levels, too many courses are simply not good enough and students are being ripped off. Enforce minimum entry standards. Stop backdoor route to immigration through use of low quality degree courses.\nThereafter:\nCut Funding to Universities that Undermine Free Speech.\nThe government’s Free Speech Act is toothless. Allowing political bias or cancel culture must face heavy financial penalties.\nPermanent Exclusions for Violent and Disruptive Students.\nDouble the number of Pupil Referral Units so schools can function safely. Disruptive children must also get support.\nUniversities Must Provide 2 Year Graduate Courses.\nThe option of 2 year courses would reduce student debt and allow earlier entry into employment to help pay it off.\nIncrease Technical Courses and Apprenticeships.\nValue young people with vocational talents. Britain needs skilled workers in engineering, construction, IT and high demand sectors.\nLife Skills Classes at School.\nSubjects such as home economics and social media risk should be part of the school curriculum. No smartphones or social media in schools under 16.",

Dr David Bull has been back to host the event, a regular on Talk TV, being a medical man, he has offered some wonderful insights into the NHS.\nThe membership has now broken through 80,000 and growing, and is now on course to overtake the Tories in the foreseeable future.\nThe structure of the party has been used by those who wish to denigrate Reform UK, but as Nigel explained, in the early days, implementing democracy could have been a serious threat to the party, because it could have been the target of organised hijacking by membership. I do feel that this is a very relevant fact that should have been reiterated before the election, in order to respond to the endless ludicrous attacks by the far left, that the party was a company and therefore a business, which it is not. Considering the fact that it was kept alive in its early days by private contributions and funding by Richard Tice.\nAs I have previously said, democratising the party was one of my greatest demands for the party, because the policies that Reform UK offer the British people are head and shoulders above the insulting pack of lies, we have been subjected to by the uniparty.\nThere is no doubt that the timing of the election was nothing to do with Rishi Sunak choosing the time that was most favourable for the Conservatives, but rather to ensure that Reform UK were caught unprepared, in order to lessen their success. This in itself, is a very sinister reality, because if we accept that Rishi must have been fully aware that he was facing a total collapse of his party at the election, his actions, his timing, his personal choice to go to the country earlier than necessary, was one of the greatest contributing factors to the surreal result.\nHe is directly responsible for the Labour party being in power with a huge majority, despite receiving a small share of the votes.\nNow that the party is on the way to democratising, the situation is changing at a rapid pace. I have always believed that aside from the policies, this is the most significant step forward that the party can take. This will hopefully lead to prospective parliamentary candidates being voted in by the members in their relevant constituencies. This is crucial, because the members should not only have an active part in the party, but they must have a choice of candidate, they must have the opportunity to engage and the candidates must be accountable to the people, this is about implementing democracy from the bottom up.\nWe are all aware of the catastrophic shambles of a party which is now in control of our country, and the future is becoming increasingly bleak, and as it stands, the Conservatives ARE NOT the opposition, in fact, we need only take a fleeting glance at any meeting of parliament to see that there is no voice of opposition to the reckless trajectory of this toxic administration.\nIn fact, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the five Reform UK MPs raise more arguments against the government than all the Conservative MPs combined, indeed, I see no reason for them to remain as Conservative MPs, as they are almost indistinguishable from Labour.\nThis conference, the launch of Democracy, the ownership and control of the party by the people is the beginning of the great resistance, this is our political D-Day and there is only one way that this war of survival can be won, and that is by the people, for the people, with the support, engagement and cooperation of the people.\nThis may sound alarmist, but our nation is facing a greater threat today, than at any time in recent history, now this may shock you in light of the fact that we have survived two world wars in the last century, but in this regard, I will quote one of the greatest men in history.\n“Nations that go down fighting rise again, but those who surrender tamely are finished”\nWinston Churchill – 1940\nI think that defines our current situation perfectly.",

2024 annual conference, Dr. David Starkey explains that Britain cannot be saved without reversing the revolutionary changes New Labour made to Britain’s constitution and institutions between 1997 – 2010.\nSummary:\nThe Catastrophe Awaiting Britain\n– A disastrous government with an unwanted huge majority is expected after the next election\n– This calamitous situation is compared to the failures of past governments like Edward Heath’s\n– There is hope that one reformer (Keith Joseph) can spark a positive reaction, just as happened after Heath’s downfall\nBlair’s Revolutionary Reforms\n– Between 1997-2010, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown carried out a revolution on a scale equivalent to Clement Attlee’s socialist reforms after WW2\n– Their “reforms” severely diminished the sovereignty of Parliament in areas like:\n– Making the Bank of England independent\n– Scottish devolution\n– Incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law\n– Establishing a Supreme Court separate from Parliament\n– Empowering unaccountable quangos and committees\n– The Equality Act privileging certain groups over equality before the law\nReversing the Disastrous Reforms\n– Any future conservative/right-wing government must embark on a deliberate “restoration” to reverse Blair’s legislative achievements\n– This must be accompanied by an educational effort to explain to the public:\n– Why concepts like “human rights” have been dangerously perverted\n– How the equalities agenda undermines true equality before the law\n– The loss of democracy and accountability caused by the reforms\nThe Courage Required\n– Enacting such a radical reversal will require genuine courage from politicians\n– They must reject the false idols of victimhood, political correctness and identity politics\n– The public must be persuaded by promoting the values of freedom that made Britain successful before these ruinous reforms\nFull Transcript:\n(00:00) [Applause] ladies and gentlemen it’s a very great pleasure to be here even though fundamentally this is a miserable occasion well we come on let shall We All Shall we all Begin by being truthful something very Dreadful and there’s no smiling something very Dreadful awaits Us in the latter part of this year and anybody who does not recognize that and I shall use the word without apology because I’m fond of using words without apology is a fool we are about to vote in a government with a vast majority that\n(00:45) nobody wants it is something that has not happened before the consequences are frightening to contemplate so there’s the Gloom let’s have a little ray of sunshine because we have been here before what we forget is the catastrophe of Liz truss is pretty fully matched by the catastrophe of Edward Heath have we all forgotten may I now remind you Heath was elected on the sson man platform which was intended to introduce radical free market reform he then engineered a boom through his Chancellor Barber that made\n(01:34) what listra and quati quatang did look like a blip property prices multiplied three times in one year right he then collapsed in the face of the miners and immediately reverted to an extreme form of keynesianism complete with price and income policies rental control TRS 3-day week and every single catastrophe you can think of and of course in the election fought on the back of the minor strike about who governs Britain everybody said anybody but you and we returned the Absurd figure of Harold pantown Wilson as we’ve\n(02:19) now as we have now discovered the hope is the reaction of one man to that in April in April 1974 Keith Joseph experienced a damine conversion he wrote about it a year later and said I thought I was a conservative now I know I wasn’t and what he did he read Hayek he spent the summer reading and thinking now that is what we are going to have to do it would be nice to think think somewhere in the upper Leons of the conservative party or even reform there was maybe somebody who had read hiek or could read hyek or\n(03:10) could think about hyek or anybody else what I want to do now is to draw the very striking comparison in other words it took remember the gigantic shift of socialism carried out in Britain by The absurdly lorded Clement Atley the foundation again most of our discontents disastrous structures of the NHS the bloating of welfare all at the time of immense exigency after War all of that took 30 years to begin to reverse thater under Heath was the Secretary of State for Education who closed more grammar schools than everybody else it is\n(03:56) possible to turn the ship State round but by why God is it difficult so where what is the parallel with where we are now what we have forgotten is that blur between 1997 and the the kind of burp of Blair Gordon Brown exhaling even more unpleasant breath and between between the two of them They carried out a revolution exactly equivalent in scale to what actually did in 45 to 51 what we’ve done is to forget that is not to understand it is not to seek to reverse it what I want to do now is to delineate that Revolution to explain it to you and\n(04:46) to tie it very much to the whole purpose of the ncf now Peter’s foundation of the ncf the direct tackling of council culture the absurdities and all the rest of it is very important but what we need to ask ourselves is why have these absurd doctrines got such purchase so quickly why are they particularly in America and in Britain what is it that has led to the penetration of the great Anglo-Saxon democracies who not only Pioneer freedom but Pioneer economic growth why have they been so profoundly vulnerable to\n(05:28) these catastrophes and my answer is that the mistake that the new culture Forum has made and I’ve said this to Peter in private I will now say it in public is to assume you can tackle culture directly you cannot the reason that the culture the reason that these absurd doctrines have triumphed is political it is only because they have a network of political support that they’ve been able to send their tentacles everywhere and that political support in this country is created by the so-called Blair constitutional reforms this is what\n(06:08) we’ve got to understand therefore the first thing that any future serious right-wing government whether it be called conservative reform uh uh whatever has got to do is to understand it has to reverse a revolution you have to carry out what we did in 1660 you have to carry out a restoration there has to be a process of going back and I think America to a large extent will have to do the same because certainly particularly post the New Deal and whole particularly the 60s changes very similar patterns appeared now what is it\n(06:50) that that Blair does that is so catastrophic well I’m afraid the list is a very long one but let me summarize it very quickly as saying essentially what it does is to subvert the central feature of the English Constitution and remember the British constitution is simply the English Constitution r large we number our Kings in accordance with the Norman Conquest Parliament is Westminster or the the order of parliaments is not altered by Act of Union with Scotland in 1707 what is the central principle or what used to be the\n(07:25) central principle of the English Constitution it was the idea of the sovereignty of Parliament that is spelled out fully by AV dcey in his great work on the law of the Constitution written at the climax of that in the late 19th century when of course it had carried Britain through the Industrial Revolution through Empire to the position of of extraordinary hegemonic power but had also done something else because of the domestic implication of that idea it had carried Britain peacefully through the gigantic social Transformations which are\n(08:03) associated with that why is that because when we talk about the supremacy of parliament we do not just mean we do not mean at all the supremacy of the House of Commons as such what is supreme in the country or was is the crown in Parliament the three bodies of the crown the Lords and the commons and this goes back not simply to the 19th century the 18th the 17th the 16th it goes back to just after Magna Cara it goes back to the 13th and particular the 14th century and already in the 14th century this why history\n(08:41) matters we are historically shaped State freedom is grounded in history this is why we have a a parliamentary building which is gothic which deliberately Echoes the Middle Ages it’s not a creation of abstract reason it’s not a cre creation of the Enlightenment it’s not a creation of the 19th century or the 18th century because back in the 13th and 14th century judges are able to say to a collection of upit a little people who don’t want to pay their tax none of us wants to pay tax and we all\n(09:15) try to come up with good reasons for doing it and they say oh we can’t possibly pay tax or we’re not we’re not legally obliged to because we weren’t sitting in Parliament to which the judges yawn and give the stock reply everybody in England is represented in Parliament either in person or by his representative and it was that idea that carries us through it’s that idea that you are bound by law because you’ve participated in making it we didn’t need to take back control because we had control and in Britain you didn’t\n(09:53) in England Britain you didn’t struggle to tear down the Constitution as you had to in France in Germany and Italy in Spain you wanted to become part of it so the suffragettes don’t want to tear Parliament down they want the right to vote and sit in Parliament the working classes my ancestors do not wish to tear Parliament down with chartism or the rise of the working class in the late 19th century on the contrary they want a place there they were given it and they take their part their honored part in\n(10:26) the great panop play the Great pageantry of State all of that reaches a climax actually a bit of a doubtful one I probably won’t have time to go over it in my talk but we may explore it in questions um the as it were the acceptance the Tory and I would say very Tory rather than conservative because I would like to distinguish between the two the very Tory acceptance of socialism reaches its climax believe it or not in 1917 the of Revolutions in which you reinvent the English Monarchy the British Monarchy this is when you change\n(11:05) the name of the royal house it’s when you change the marital rules of the royal family so that you marry English people rather than Germans which you had to up to that point you had to to preserve uh the the uh uh the nobility or or rather the royalty of the German side of the house they had a role of deance um but in 1917 you reverse all of that and you do something else that’s even more extraordinary you completely reform the honest system to mean that Ordinary People could be given an honor first time ever and do you know where\n(11:41) the first inauguration of the order of British Empire took place I bro Park football stadium and the star of the show was a little woman working in the Glasgow Munitions Factory who got her MBE and at the same time you introduce bizar the tit it the order of Companions of Honor specifically for socialists and trade unionists because of course they will be too conscious of their socialist dignity to want to vulgarize it by peerage or a title of nobility or being called Sir how far did they get them wrong but anyway the companion of Honor was\n(12:20) deliberately invented to incorporate socialism into the establishment so this extraordinary placing in the panop play of English History all undone in n in all undone from 1997 onwards if we look at it it’s an astonishing story and what he every single feature of it does is remove power from Parliament and the elected representatives in Parliament and it’s worth and it’s worth putting in a quick footnote here most of us participated willingly and enthusiastically in brexit with the Great slogan Take Back Control that\n(13:02) sense that our Sovereign Parliament and therefore us this is the whole point Parliament as the as the Keystone of the arch of English and British democracy the slogan unfortunately was misplaced because the power had not gone to Continental Europe This Is Why brexit has been such a profound disappointment the erosion of democracy Ry is at home the seeping away from Parliament is into our domestic institutions into the quangos and into the legal institutions and into the devolved assemblies this is the disaster\n(13:45) so we were attacking the wrong Parliament it was the right thing to do but it did not have the desired consequences and we need to understand that and to admit it and to comprehend it and to fit it into our general interpretive pattern but if you then look at this process of the dimin diminution of the sovereignty of parliament it takes place with astonishing speed the independence of the bank of England remember the nationalization of the bank of England is actually done by a labor government if we look again I do not wish to\n(14:17) sustain the Absurd self- delusions of Liz truss but the general record of the bank of England since mvin King ceased to be Governor is disastrous in comparison with any but and it’s also entirely unamenable to us these people are entirely and deliberately unanswerable to anybody so the independence of the government of of the bank of England Scottish Devolution 1998 creating of course this grotesque parody of a government in Edinburgh which is contriving to reproduce all the worst features of pre-union Scotland the\n(14:55) factionalism the corruption the idiotic kind of noxian pursuit of Purity every single undesirable feature of clanism and Calvinism combin in the detestable person of Nicholas ston and [Applause] [Music] um again 199 but look at what this means it means that remember the only point of connection between England and Scotland was Parliament when you cre because Scotland by with with with the the wonderfully generous settlement of 190 of 1707 preserves every other feature of statehood it preserves its right to issue currency its own legal system its\n(15:41) own educational system its own church its own herit its own heraldry its own order of Knighthood its own Court its own Crown it’s only Parliament and you break that Bond you shatter the thing that had created the world’s most successful state because it was I the the idea of a union in America is a deliberate development of the idea of unionism in England in Britain it’s exactly what it is anyway so you you you then set up this profound contradiction between the essentially unitary British State and\n(16:15) Devolution you’ve taken the fundamental levers of control over monetary policy out of the only people who can answer for it then with the incorporation of the ECR in 1998 you do something even more cap catastrophic you incorporate a doctrine of universal human rights that means a law which has got Authority which does not depend on popular conent do we all understand this it sounds lovely it is disastrous then there’s a slight pause whilst we digest that extraordinary series of things but it all starts again\n(16:53) in 2005 with the so-called constitutional Reform Act uh uh of 20 05 which sets up a supreme court how can you have a supreme court and a supreme Parliament they are logically completely contradictory the American system depends on a separation of powers controlled by a supreme court as the final Authority we never had that and again you introduce by the by the uh demotion of the office of Lord Chancellor you introduce a serious attempt at creating a um a separation of powers again everybody because of this sheer unthinking notion that the\n(17:35) American Constitution is good forgets that Britain cannot have a separation of powers how can you have a separation of powers when the head of the Executive sits in the legislature the Prime Minister and normally controls it so we’ve introduced what they did they introduced a series of the most staggering contradictions and tensions so we’ve been in a state of permanent constitutional crisis uh since the end of new labor and we’ve also been in a state in which nobody’s actually responsible because we’ve then gone on\n(18:13) and we have multiplied endless quangos we put the whole of climate change policy which Now controls the basic structure of the economy into a specialist committee we have put the entire business of Land Management English nature that’s why we can’t build it’s not it’s not the wicked conservatives it’s the fact that vast wayes of the countryside are designated as you know bat reserves or for n and so what it’s tempting to sound as though one’s parodying unfortunately you’re not\n(18:45) that is the case um and then finally and disastrously the equalities act now why is the equality again you see all of these things human rights the consolidation of nature the uh the idea of equality these all sound wonderful don’t they why is it they’ve gone so badly wrong well we need to understand some absolute fundamentals here what happened under new labor is essentially an Americanization I said that there were two countries where the cultural revolution had got purchase it’s England and America we undergo a\n(19:27) partial Americanization of our Constitution and it’s one that goes into areas that we haven’t really thought about and until I started working on this I hadn’t fully thought about do you know new labor even perverts charity do you want to know why the Royal National Lifeboat League behaves in the funny way it does because it was written into the Charities Act of 2006 that the pursuit of Human Rights and international Amity and ever is now charitable so you write in to what had been previously highly strictly defined\n(20:05) this series of vague General Notions which are entirely unlimited by the nation are extraneous to the nation there’s then another point to make which is what has happened to the idea of Human Rights all our enemies say ah but the Tes were responsible for the European convention it was Maxwell light Maxwell 5 as attorney general and interesting enough an attorney general who was one of the last great persecutors of homosexuals we need to couple this authorship of human rights with remembering his domestic role but\n(20:39) what is important to realize is that the echr like everything else has been perverted it’s been perverted in two ways it was never intended to be a court to which individuals could directly appeal if you look at the European convention it’s very interesting to look for example Le at the the relative position of the uh say freedom of speech in America freedom of speech um under the Second Amendment under the uh uh under the Bill of Rights is absolute here in our convention because the convention was not really intended\n(21:18) as law but a guide to the making of law it’s subject to considerations of public morality safety um uh domestic peace in other words judges can twid it around in whatever Direction they like but there’s a much bigger issue here which again I’m afraid is one of the reasons why that other magnificent creation of 45 the United Nations and and whatever itself has turned into and and the uh the uh International Convention on human rights why they’ve all turned into disasters they were deliberately\n(21:55) perverted by the communist block can I re recommend to everybody here to read a remarkable book you can get around it by reading a single article it’s by a man called Jacob machang Gama uh m c h a m g m a machang Gama who is Believe It or Not A Dane but obviously a mixed race Dane and what he demonstrated was that the Soviets and their allies between the 60s 70s and the early 80s penetrate the entire Machinery of Human Rights and twist it it the original intention of Human Rights was to protect the right of\n(22:33) the individual against the state what the Soviets do using anti-imperialism and racism as the leevers to do it is to turn it into the supposed protection of minorities against the majority and what that requires of course is you pervert the entire Machinery of Human Rights and particularly freedom of speech you invert it you turn it against itself you turn a doctrine of freedom of speech into a doctrine of hate speech which limits freedom of speech now we have to understand all of these things it’s hard\n(23:12) work what we need is therefore a serious legislative program it is a legislative program that will set itself deliberately and quickly to reverse the entire legislative achievement of the new labor years of 1997 to 2010 it has to do that until we do that frankly we are pedling we are doing nothing and we can do nothing this is why the conservative government of the last 14 years has been as catastrophic a failure as it has because the structures that have put in place from 1997 to 2010 make it as we’re seeing over one over\n(23:58) one and as as uh we we we we saw with the extraordinary case of prorogation they make it absolutely impossible to do most conservative things we have to understand this and until we have a political party that actually has a program saying this but it also has to be accompanied with an educational program we have to explain these things to people we have to explain why human rights sound nice and cuddly but are in fact the opposite of what they mean it’s not easy it’s deliberately not easy this is new\n(24:39) speak what we’ve got to do is to understand of course that the the the George Orwell remember Orwell’s dictatorship can I remind you all 1984 is a leftwing dictatorship can I also remind you what is the Striking thing about it it is the importance of language anguage it is the importance of language which again is exactly what we’ve seen ourselves in the last few years and finally and there’s a point again which I do not think has been properly understood in Orwell if you read 1984 you’ll see that there are actually two\n(25:18) classes of people there are the pros the ordinary people who were left entirely untouched in a state of fre Freedom squalor beer sex and whatever and then there are the middle classes the party members the Believers in the rubbish Big Brother well they I’m afraid are exactly the people who are running us exactly the people who are privileged by this structure this structure of Law and this structure of of of quangos and the structure of elite committees and the sense of perversion ladies and gentlemen is deep and is appalling the\n(26:03) fundamental principle of law should be equality but what does the equality act do it privileges particular groups this was understood and I will dare to mention the name this was understood by Enoch Powell immediately the race relations act of 1968 was passed the moment you privilege one named group the moment you protect one named group they become a privileged group and you destroy the entire basis of law law has to be blind law has to be Universal we have instead created a law which is theological which is aimed at\n(26:47) protecting particular groups we’ve abandoned any notion of proper distributive justice and instead we’ve embarked on this notion that the goal of law is somehow to bring about equality or to redress wrong to redress vast social wrong the moment you put an adjective in front of Justice you have perverted it so you see what I mean we we’ve got to what I’m outlining is obviously something of impossible absurd radicalism that’s why I began by saying no for your comfort rather like Luther um but can I suggest that we have to\n(27:34) first of all and you will forgive me this will sound horribly patronizing we’ have to start by educating ourselves we’ve to recognize how far our opponents have been successful because they’ve controlled language because they’ve seized these nice sounding words and turn them into vehicles for horror which all forms of dict leadership do the last time we had laws governing speech as such was in the reformation and Henry VII and treason by words it’s taken freedom and liberty to take us back to the reign of Henry VII I\n(28:13) think that would be good pause moment to pause I hope I’ve thrown up enough to produce the odd question thank you [Applause] David thank you so much uh obviously questions uh please make them questions won’t you uh not just uh statements of your opinion um can we start with the gentleman here and then the gentleman writes the back uh is uh is one solution to go the whole hog and um get instead of the um Constitution being constituted in England of the laws in the basement of Parliament and get a written\n(29:15) constitution in the sense of the US and and sweep away um by doing so you know lots of this wokery Etc and and constitute that constitution in the manner of a us one that’s so that’s precisely what I’ve been saying we mustn’t do that that the that that that look can we just really pause and think again can I suggest please everybody try to read Hayek’s constitution of Liberty it is not easygoing but it should be our Bible there are two different ways of running government and human Affairs one\n(29:56) is that you rely on the notion of if you like the free market of ideas tested by time that is the great idea of Adam Smith and the English Enlightenment of the 18th century it’s expressed in the idea of common law which has no specific origin and is subject to continuous slow modification and development and it produces of course in England in the course of the Middle Ages a society which gives you all of those rights which are set out in the American Constitution life liberty and property and lays the foundation long before the\n(30:39) American Constitution is written of the gigantic explosion of human energy creativity and intelligence that leads both to Industrial Revolution and the astonishing turmoil of ideas in late 16th 17th and 18th century England this is where we invent modernity what is the great Paradox we invent modernity by rooting it in the past this is the Supreme Paradox it’s understood right at the beginning of this process by Jeffrey chorer when he’s dealing with what we conventionally call the Renaissance in the late 14th century\n(31:16) comes up with when you’re first really reencountering the great works of Greece and Rome in their original form he comes up with this wonderful four lines just as each year after of the old ground new corn Springs so from these old books new learning comes and it’s this this this is the process of the market the English Constitution is the Constitutional expression of the market now the other view is the French all bad ideas of French it is it is um apart from food um and wine and architecture and dress come on let’s let’s we’re\n(32:07) compliment you England and France are the missing halves of the perfect civilization never never with the do thrown in and the but the what France does under the influence of deart is to come up with a completely different notion which is that you improve Human Condition not by slow organ growth but by aood by by an explosion in the brain by starting everything from scratch in other words the catastrophe of the French Revolution the thing that from which France has never recovered and I think never will recover once you\n(32:45) destroy the basis of legitimacy in a state to that extent it never ever fully recovers now the American Revolution is this extraordinary middle ground it uses the rhetoric of the French Revolution but in fact it doesn’t dis change very much okay the Tores are driven out and some nasty Behavior but but essentially the American Constitution is a very lightly reworked version of the English constitution of the 18th century the Bill of Rights is simply what the um what the uh uh what common law conveys the problem is it was Blair using that\n(33:23) model to drive through a perverted notion of the 18 Century that’s the problem there’s also something else we need to remember that notion of starting everything from scratch is what has powered every Revolution since the French and all revolutions are disasters we need to understand this no revolution has made anything better anywhere and I challenge anybody to it’s they are simply destructive and their standard feature is to replicate the worst features of the an RA look at China look at you where where\n(34:01) where you have a series of mad Emperors uh see after the fall of the Ching Dynasty I mean they aren’t just they behave like Emperors the entire structure similarly Putin now deliberately invoke sardam things do not change whereas we were able to do something else it’s the great Israeli who explains this if you’re a cons our sort of conservative of course you believe in progress if you’re committed to structures of free market in ideas and free market in an economy of course you believe in change\n(34:35) the question is not changing it’s how you change do you change in accordance with abstract principle in which case it will be a catastrophe or do you change organically in accordance with the traditions and constitutions of your own country Blair did the former and reaped well we’ve reaped he hasn’t unfortunately we’ve reaped the disastrous consequences and I think the most obscene thing is seeing Blair struck in the panop strut around in the panoply of a knight of the Gart at Windsor it is the most vomit making\n(35:13) spectacle I have ever encountered a man who hated tradition treated it with contempt patronized the queen exploited the death of Diana and generally speaking exhibited moral and political bankruptcy [Music] [Applause] so no please not a written Constitution have I made myself clear just gentleman down here yep hi so suppose you get everything you want and uh somehow we get a government I I I’m not hearing a thing hello you hear me yeah can you take it slightly away from take your voice down little bit hello is that\n(36:00) better your way all right take three um so suppose you get everything you want and somehow we get a government that takes the kind of action you’re demanding gives us this restoration rolls back all the blairite reforms Etc how do we prevent the government after that from just doing the opposite and reversing the reversal well you can’t and you shouldn’t I mean one of the things that we one of the things we have to have confidence about finally and again um there’s a logical reason for this if I\n(36:30) am right that essentially Freedom that is the right of people to think act create make money in their own ways is the actual Foundation of human progress we need to leave people to be free they will make mistakes but finally I suppose and I may now be exhibiting absurd naive they will get it right the profound risk of course is that and we see this I’m I’m afraid the Blair years are going to be followed by a deliberate intensification do we all realize that the that as part of the program of the forthcoming labor government is the RO\n(37:15) constitutional reform as understood by Gordon Brown every single feature that I have mentioned is going to be redoubled and redoubled and entrenched we must not under estimate what the struggle will be there is the attempt and again what I do not understand is it has all been so catastrophically wrong we we’ve known it’s wrong for I mean why is our why is the management of our economy gone so disastrously wrong because we’ve played with econometrics this absurd notion that you can quantify something as complex as a national\n(37:54) economy and then on the basis of those figures do delicately little tweaks it’s a deranged method instead what you should be doing is aiming at a broadly balanced budget and again we’ve got to recover we’ve got to recover genuine courage this seems to me there’s only one virtue and again it’s the whole attack and women here will forgive me on the classic masculine Virtues Of which courage is the central one every other virtue is useless without courage it is why I repudiate with passion the\n(38:31) word victim I hate that word we’re turning ourselves into a supine culture of victimhood and it’s cont temptable and it will reap the rewards which contempt deserves but that courage has got to say the unsayable we have a state whose size is ruinous we are going the way of Rome all inflation is the result of State activity it’s it’s monetary have you but why is inflation so persistent in America why is it so persistent in Britain because governments continue borrowing vast amounts of money and\n(39:18) throwing it into the economy Biden’s Behavior at the moment in America guarantees inflation sunak with Furlow guarantees inflation trust guaranteed inflation with the whole notion of borrowing to pay people’s fuel bills and and if you Institute a welfare state which is unsustainable in its scale it’s exactly what happened to Rome with carala when he double the wages of the Roman army from that point onwards you have a state which is too big for the economy it becomes parasitic and it starts actually to devour when it should\n(39:55) be encouraging creation we’ve got to look learn to say these things and I think the lesson will be driven home I will for once wear the mantle of Prophecy I think we will see the IMF back within about 18 months of the labor government uh we can have two more questions actually umit we have that side um Al the gentleman there with the red youu yeah yeah you and then okay yeah thank you is the equality act so bad uh in theory it protects not just minorities or women or gay people just it says you can’t discriminate on the\n(40:35) basis of race or sex or sexuality also the belief-based Discrimination part is actively working to protect conservatives liberals gender critical feminists Believers and color blindness should we scrap it I’m not really sure I I could no I couldn’t tou I’m sorry I’m sorry the the microphones work good in that direction they’re very difficult I’m can you go very slowly elderly hearing and slow brains I’m sorry I’ll try speak to yourself is the equality act as bad as is being made out as I am\n(41:09) making it out well Peter said we should uh get rid of it earlier um because you said it’s an it’s an enemy of Universalist justice but in theory it protects everybody it doesn’t say you can’t discriminate against minorities and women it says you can’t discriminate on the basis of race or sex or sexuality does isn’t that Universalist so you know the point the point is very simple if you have equality before the law an equality Act is completely unnecessary it’s it’s it it it is a it\n(41:42) is a simple logical statement read hyek you don’t an an equality act privileges Puffs like me un necessarily except it doesn’t privilege me as much as a lesbian and it doesn’t privilege me as much as a transsexual and this is silly and wrong all we need is genuine again you know look look at the scandal of our policing in London at the moment the incident yesterday you are obviously a Jew sir can you imagine that in Britain and it’s the jaw drops at the horror of the thing but that is once you\n(42:25) start the whole point of the whole point of work is that it replaces a notion of equality before the law with group Allegiance and again it’s it’s it’s important we understand this historically the there’s there’s a most Splendid work of a young well no longer young but young we’d be very cross with me but but but Patrick Nash his wonderful book on Islam and English law the reason that we developed this astonishing legal system in England was because we managed to outlaw cousin marriage cousin marriage leads to Clans\n(43:02) which means that you have got a loyalty to the group rather than to the state and you’re judged as a member of a group rather than an individual woke and the whole business of black rights and whatever aspires to do that it completely breaks down the uniformity before the law and creates a series of privileged groups similarly the whole no the whole way in which freedom of speech has been interpreted particularly because religious belief is protected is demented you protected if you believe in what is it JD something or another the\n(43:39) only thing that’s not protected at law is reason I mean if you if if if you advance some mad justification for islamism Judaism quakerism i w up a Quaker you’re protected if you simply say this is unreasonable like the Preposterous statement that a man can become a woman or vice versa then then then the whole weight until recently has descended upon you I mean it is this I keep going on it’s the perversion of language an equality Act is in fact designed to produce privilege specific privileged groups the\n(44:15) the way freedom of speech is imposed on us is designed to limit freedom of speech you hate hate speech legislation is designed to permit hate speech by privileged groups and prevent the rest of us from objecting this is the terrible Blair newspaper I think we actually had one example this week uh DAV David you might if you’re on Twitter at all of uh a man being visited by police and an NHS psychiatrist yes uh basically for for uh essentially uh having written something I think on Facebook but it was so alien that it\n(45:06) almost looked as though it must have been staged but it wasn’t can you imagine a policeman I mean dear me the police are not shall I say our most intellectual profession saying check your thinking sir I just this is you again I I’m not a Christian in fact I’m very much an anti Christian but Jesus was terribly shrewd on politics and he came up with one wonderful line by their fruits you shall know them if you want to look at the fruits of woke judge it by those if you want to look at the fruits of this\n(45:44) perversion of language simply do what we’ve been doing now and but you’ve then got to ask why why can these absurdities happen it is because there’s a legal framework which not only protects them but in large measure legislates them uh just one more question it’s from alah thank you uh yes thank you just um a couple of quick things just very quickly to add on the equality act it introduces an extraordinary um element of subjectivity into the definition of racism um and it actually I was just thinking about this what it seems to be\n(46:26) doing now is conf transforming transferring what was a presumption of equality and freedom that we all had in a political and in a moral sense as Citizens into something that is now to be conferred top down by the state and by the courts and now you’re seeing this proliferation of you know wanting to get protected characteristics we shouldn’t need protecting to say what we think um so so there’s that I think that really and and you talk about the Bold courage needed of politicians we need a political class that can say no\n(47:01) disparities along race-based lines is not racism not that it may be racism or it may not be it isn’t it isn’t because it denies intentionality and without intentionality you can’t have racism what I wanted to ask you though David was that you you you proposed that what is needed is a is a kind of Suite of legisl looking at the legislative structures and reforming that which is I find very persuasive and and and agree with um however in terms of reaching public and winning public consent which will be needed for some of the extent of\n(47:37) the changes that are going to be needed I don’t think law alone is enough and for me I would want to ask you what what kind of what are the resources I for me I’m more drawn to moral philosophy not in an abstract academic sense but drawing on that to make abstract arguments concrete so that we can can go out there and make better arguments and hopefully win more support I think again it’s by their fruits you shall know them what we need to do is and again the deliberate attack on our history is an attack on the\n(48:17) opposite of woke our early success our success before this nonsense emerged is the best argument against it the astonishing creativity of our society before this nonsense the signs of it shuttering down the I mean remember there’s one very simple fact if we want good facts are we all familiar with my friend mvin King’s wonderful remark that there are only two facts that you need to know about post-war British economic policy growth that starts in 199 growth starts in 1979 and stops in 2008 it coincides precisely with the\n(49:12) chronology that I’ve given you and there is absolutely no accident this what we’re seeing is a shuttering down of what has been the most successful State and Society because I regard regard America us as really kind of slightly distant twins um um but we we need to understand that and the the the again again we have one thing we’re a tiny little island how has this little island done what it’s done it is because it pioneered freedom but what we’ve got to do we’ve got to start about talking about Freedom\n(49:59) not simply in terms of economic growth economic growth is very important but you then fall into the Oscar wild trap you know the price of everything and the value of nothing we’ve got to start talking about the value of Freedom we’ve got to start talking about the fact that we gave a model not simply of industrialization but of behavior to the world that we gave a model of living to the world we invent the weekend we invent All Sport we invent dress all do we all realize this the French were still laboring under the ab\n(50:33) ab and whatever we invent the FL the the coat that you can actually wear and still look smart and go riding or walk in the streets without being piled by the mob I mean it’s that sense of what was created what we created which is why the attack on history is so catastrophically damaging and there’s a final point and here again I want to register disagreement with even people in the room whom I greatly respect and I’m very fond of there is a Tau now that we need some sort of religious revival to pull ourselves back I do not\n(51:11) believe this I believe and I want to end on this note please Peter I don’t want anything else I Believe in a Thing Called historical Transcendence I believe and I tried to communicate it in much of my television that standing in a building in the presence of our ancestors and their achievement is as great as kneeling down and invoking a God who may or may not exist there’s an extraordinary passage in a man who did believe in God in the little Gidding one of the four quartets of TS Elliot in which he talks about\n(51:55) this experience of transcendence of hearing the feet that walk before the rustle of the clothes that have moved here before the echo of the ideas and of the hopes and the fears and the achievements we need to listen ourselves and we need to be able to communicate it thank you thank you [Applause] [Applause] hello if you’re enjoying the new culture Forum Channel and you

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_knife-crime-in-northampton-north-is-alarming/content_362.html": "Knife crime in Northampton North is alarming\nA 15-year-old boy faced conviction for the murder of another teenager in a revenge attack. Fred, aged 16 and known as Rohan Shand, perished after being stabbed on Northampton’s Harborough Road on 22 March.\nThe boy was found guilty following a three-week trial at Northampton Crown Court. The jury acquitted a second defendant, a 17-year-old boy, of murder and manslaughter charges. Both defendants previously admitted possession of a blade and await sentencing at the same court.\nThe younger defendant, 14 at the time, told the jury he carried a knife solely to “scare” Mr Shand.\nJurors heard Mr Shand was blamed by the defendants after one of their friends was injured in a McDonald’s dispute a day earlier. The younger defendant said he and two others planned a “revenge” attack on Mr Shand and others. Snapchat discussions and scouting near Mr Shand’s school preceded the attack.\nThe defendants sought Mr Shand and another boy “to fight”, but the younger one insisted he never expected a killing, despite bringing two knives. The seven-second attack prompted witnesses to alert police, who found the younger teen hiding in an attic.\nReacting to the verdicts, Mr Shand’s father, Rohan Shand Snr, said: “Justice has taken place for my son. It’s not going to bring back my son.”\nHe hoped “these youths see what is going on and start to take heed from this. You’re not going to kill someone with a knife and walk free.”\nDet Insp Simon Barnes called the violence used to resolve a “petty dispute” “horrifying”.\nHe described the “brutal and public” nature of the death as causing “shockwaves”.\n“Fred had a family expecting him to arrive home from school, but that wasn’t to be,” he said.\n“Since when has it been that a child cannot walk home from school without fear of being stabbed? How did we, as a society, get here?”\nHe warned: “Boys and young men need to realise that when you take a knife to a fight, this is the consequence. The teenager responsible will now carry this guilt and the stigma attached for the rest of his life.”\nComment\nKnife crime in any number is catastrophic, young men are becoming increasingly drawn in to knife-crime and the consequences are all to often devastating. Here in Northampton North, there has been a worrying increase in both drugs and knife-crime and this must be addressed, before it increases even further.\nWe need more CCTV and police presence on the streets, but we must also address the causes, not just the symptoms. It will not do to brush this under the carpet, or to justify any form of anti-social behaviour, because this is a downward spiral and the only way to deal with this is by prevention, before these boys are drawn in to the world of drugs and crime.\nThere have been some steps taken already on a local level by Kingsthorpe Parish Council to reduce the incidence of anti-social behaviour, but this needs to be a collective effort and to be effective, we need support. There is not enough CCTV in Kingsthorpe, or Northampton North as a whole and this must be the starting point. We also need to look at using modern technology to assist people in reporting incidents as soon as possible.\nI am in discussion with local people to look for suggestions on taking some steps to improve things, if you do have any suggestions, please feel free to get in touch with me and hopefully, we can address this collectively as a community.",

But thanks to our political elite, we can expect to hear much more of it.\nIt will be described as a bombshell, but the warning signs have been there for many years. I have long tried to warn people that UK politics was heading in a sectarian direction, but it was too inconvenient for our political and media class to accept my comments.\nThe New Religion Of Diversity And Multiculturalism\nMass immigration, diversity and multiculturalism have become gods that we are all supposed to bow down to. The difference this time is that this religious sectarian victory is here to stay.\nI’ve been openly saying, too, that this new form of sectarianism will lead to the hard-Left Islamist party getting a foothold in Westminster. Again, people chose to ignore me.\nSectarian Politics Can Turn Ugly\nAs we saw in previous decades in Northern Ireland, sectarian politics can be ugly and violent. And this by-election has been very ugly indeed.\nIntimidation At The Polls\nGalloway supporters turned Reform UK candidate Simon Danczuk at the only public hustings of the campaign. Worse still, on voting day itself, we saw Galloway supporters openly campaigning at polling stations in direct contravention of the law. The police seemed to just stand by and do nothing.\nThe Threat To Westminster\nIn the upcoming British general election, there will be a well-funded campaign that will focus on up to 30 urban constituencies that have large Muslim populations. By 2029, this could really hurt the Labour party, which will serve them right in many ways for an irresponsible immigration policy.\nQuestions Over Postal Voting\nThe sharp increase in postal votes which are open to abuse must also be investigated; it is going to make our country more divided than we have ever seen. In the Oldham by-election of 2015, even Left-wing publications described how very few people spoke English and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had low recognition, yet everyone was voting Labour.\nWe Should Have Seen This Coming\nBut I digress. We should not be surprised by Galloway’s victory. He has done this before. The Bradford West by-election of 2012 was the first time that I had seen people in England voting purely along sectarian lines.\nIf you want to look into our political future, just consider the words of Chris Williamson, the deputy leader of Galloway’s ‘Worker’s Party of Britain’. On election night, he told GB News that more children are being killed every day in Gaza than were being killed at Auschwitz. It is vile, it is repugnant. But I’m afraid we can expect to hear much more of it.\nSummary\n– I warned that mass immigration and multiculturalism policies would lead to sectarian politics in the UK, but was ignored\n– Sectarian politics can turn ugly and violent, as seen in the Batley and Spen by-election\n– Galloway supporters intimidated other candidates and illegally campaigned at polling stations\n– There could be a well-funded Islamist political campaign focused on 30 constituencies in the next general election\n– There are questions around the sharp rise in postal voting and potential abuse/intimidation\n– Galloway has won elections like this before by mobilizing the Muslim vote along sectarian lines\n– Statements from Galloway’s party deputy leader comparing Gaza to Auschwitz shows the kind of vile rhetoric we can expect more of\n– The rise of sectarian politics and divisions in the UK has long been predictable but was inconvenient for politicians and media to address\n– This could seriously damage Labour in the long run for their role enabling this through uncontrolled immigration policies",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-conservative-partys-ideological-rift/content_888.html": "The Conservative Party’s Ideological Rift\nThe British Conservative Party is grappling with an internal rift over its ideological direction, with accusations that Downing Street is deliberately blocking traditional right-wing candidates from contesting the general election. The aim, according to those on the Tory right, is to ensure the party’s dominance by centrist forces aligned with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s more moderate stance.\nThe Alleged Purge of Right-Wing Candidates\nConservative MPs and party insiders claim that Sunak is attempting to purge the party of those who support low-tax, small-state conservatism, paving the way for centrists to take control after the election. The allegation is that even if Sunak loses the election and resigns as leader, he will have already ensured the party cannot shift to the right by filling its parliamentary ranks with moderate “One Nation Tories” who would reject potential right-wing leadership candidates.\nThe Rejection of “True Blue” Conservatives\nSome Tory MPs have expressed dismay that high-quality applicants with traditional Conservative values are being rejected from the list of approved parliamentary candidates, while those who believe in higher taxation and increased public spending are being approved, even if they lack the requisite skills to serve as MPs effectively.\nThe Battle for the Conservative Soul\nThis controversy is the latest evidence of the civil war raging within the Conservative Party between those who believe it must move to the right to combat the growing threat of the Reform UK party, and those who believe the only way to remain electable is to occupy the center ground of British politics.\nAccusations of Anti-Brexit Bias and Diversity Obsession\nApplicants who have spoken to The Telegraph describe those in charge of the selection process as “yellow Tories” – a derogatory term for centrists – whose preference is for candidates that are largely indistinguishable from Liberal Democrats. They allege a clear anti-Brexit bias among those who interview applicants and complain that rather than being grilled on Conservative values, they are asked multiple questions about promoting diversity.\nThe Case of Aman Bhogal\nAman Bhogal, a former diplomat who contested a Northern Ireland seat in 2015 but has not been selected since, said the Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) was involved in a “stitch-up” by blocking right-wingers from making it onto constituency shortlists. He claims that in the past, candidates were asked about their Conservative values and ideals, but now the focus is on “how you have promoted diversity and how you have addressed white privilege.”\nThe Plight of Lord Frost\nAmong those who would like to be a Tory MP is Lord Frost, the former Brexit negotiator, who has made it clear he would renounce his peerage to sit in the Commons. Although he has not made any public comment, The Telegraph understands he has been blocked by CCHQ from applying for seats in the Commons. A Sunak loyalist suggested Frost is being excluded because “he is a member of the House of Lords who is also trying to remove the Party leader.”\nThe Blocked Brexiteer Candidates\nDavid Campbell Bannerman, a former Conservative MEP who has been on the approved list of candidates since 2019, says he is being blocked from progressing to the long list for any particular seat “because I wasn’t being nice enough about Rishi Sunak.” Another candidate who has been overlooked said: “Essentially, true blue Conservative candidates are just campaign fodder, people who will shove leaflets through doors – CCHQ has no serious intention of letting them stand in a winnable seat, if at all.”\nThe Rise of the “Liberal Democrat Tories”\nThe unnamed candidate added, “If, like me, you’re pro-Brexit, tough on immigration and want low tax, CCHQ see you as a repulsive headbanger. Too many in the party might as well be Liberal Democrats.”\nThe Fallout from Flawed Selections\nProblems with the selection process have been blamed for MP defections in recent years, including former Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston and former South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen, both of whom jumped ship to Change UK and then the Liberal Democrats, as well as former Wokingham MP Phillip Lee, who defected to the Liberal Democrats.\nCCHQ’s Defense and Counterattack\nA CCHQ source denied the claims of ideological bias, stating: “These claims have no basis in fact. It’s obviously a bit difficult for candidates who attack the party leader to be selected given they will be asking constituents to cast their votes for him to be Prime Minister.” However, the source acknowledged blocking candidates hostile to Sunak, adding, “But the idea that people are not being put forward because of some ideological bent is totally false.”\nThe Diversity Dilemma\nCritics argue that CCHQ’s obsession with diversity has led to the sidelining of merit-based selections, with Brexiteers and traditional conservatives overlooked as centrists who should be Liberal Democrats infiltrate the party ranks. The row exposes the fractured state of the Conservative Party as different factions wrestle for control over its uncertain future.\nThe Power Brokers\nInfluential figures in the selection process include Gareth Fox, chief of staff to the chairman of the candidates committee, a Remainer tasked by David Cameron with making the party more diverse; Baroness Jenkin of Kennington, who co-founded Women2Win with Theresa May to increase female Tory MP numbers; Matt Wright, chairman of the candidates committee; Matt Lane, director of candidates; and Dougie Smith, a long-term No 10 fixer who vets candidates and liaises between Downing Street and the candidates committee.\nThe Implications for the Party’s Future\nEven if Sunak loses the election and quits as party leader, he can determine what sort of party his successor inherits by controlling the list of potential parliamentary candidates. By blocking right-wing candidates and favoring centrists, he could shape the Conservative Party’s ideological trajectory for years to come.\nThe High Stakes\nWith 63 Conservative MPs already announcing their intention to step down at the election, the stakes are high as candidates are selected to contest those constituencies. The outcome of this internal battle will not only determine the party’s electoral prospects but also define the very essence of modern British conservatism.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_is-the-institution-of-marriage-now-more-or-less-dead/content_296.html": "Is the institution of marriage now more or less dead\nFeminist Louise Perry has published another extract from her book, in which she discusses the fall of marriage.\nThe institution of marriage is now more or less dead. In 1968, eight per cent of children were born to parents who were not married; in 2019, it was almost half. And now in this country there is a divorce for every two marriages.\nIt was not meant to be like this. Proponents of the 1969 Divorce Reform Act – the key piece of liberalising legislation – believed the changes they argued for would be an act of kindness towards a smallish number of unhappy people stuck in wretched marriages, and lift the stigma from the then tiny minority unfortunate enough to have been through divorce.\n‘This Bill does not open the door to easy divorce,’ announced the attorney general of the time. And yet open it did.\nThere was always a threshold of marital dysfunction above which a marriage was considered beyond saving, and reformers intended to nudge that line only a little.\nYet each marginal divorce made the next one more likely, and the one after that more likely still, with the result that the threshold went hurtling downwards at great speed.\nOver the next decade, divorces trebled and then kept rising, peaking in the 1980s. Since then there has been a slight decline in the rate, not because of a return to marital longevity but because you can’t get divorced if you don’t get married in the first place, and marriage rates are at a historic low.\nIt’s right, of course, that some marriages should end, particularly where there is violence, and in those cases the liberalisation of divorce laws was a blessing. But most modern divorces are not a consequence of domestic abuse.\nRather, they are the result of a fundamental change in attitudes as British society entered the era of self-expressive marriage. Self-discovery, self-esteem and personal growth became the key markers of a marriage’s success. Before then, couples who were not ‘irreparably unhappy’ tended to remain married. Now they usually don’t.\nIf a couple have grown apart, fallen out of love, they try for a fresh start, even though it’s a step that doesn’t always deliver. For many divorced women, the promise of happier alternative relationships remains unfulfilled – they are more likely than men to remain permanently single afterwards.\nAs many as half of divorced people in the UK report in surveys that they regret it. But the mood that it’s better to cut and run is catching, and in a culture of high divorce rates even marriages that last will run the risk of being undermined. With wedding vows no longer truly binding, and marriage accepted as impermanent, couples become less confident in their relationships and the institution as a whole changes in ways that no one could have imagined.\nHer are my thoughts for what they are worth!\nThe question is, why has marriage become irrelevant and who has benefitted?\nA good starting point is to look backwards first, then try to decipher what has happened. Historically, marriage was a pledge taken by two people in front of their village elders, to devote their lives to one another. In fact, in the days of the Old Testament, the act of sex was considered to be entering in to marriage, that should make a few of you very uncomfortable!\nThere is no doubt, that there is nothing more beautiful than two people pledging to devote their lives to each other, but that was not to be the case for ever.\nThe intervention of Church and State\nAs time went by, the Church decided, in their wisdom, that marriage should be a religious ceremony and using their influence, it gradually became law around the world that only marriage in a Church, or whichever religious institution was prevalent in any particular country, would be recognised. Not willing to be left out of the equation, one by one, most governments eventually involved themselves in the institution of marriage, making it a matter of state.\nAs this happened over long periods of time, the implications were never considered or even recognised by the masses, who continued to live their lives according to tradition, but behind the scenes, there was a ticking time-bomb.\nOnce the Church involved itself in marriage, it began to impose its draconian measures upon people, with the usual recipe of threats of hell and damnation for those who did not comply. At the same time, when marriage became a matter of state, the government had the right to impose terms and legal obligations, in matters that did not concern them and more importantly, laws imposed for political reasons.\nThe ending of polygyny\nAs many of you are aware, in the Old Testament, polygyny was permitted, there are many arguments on all sides where this is concerned and it may seem like a very strange concept to us in the modern day, but at that time, men would often die prematurely in battle or from disease, so it was a case of ensuring that all women had the opportunity to marry and have children. At the same time, death during childbirth was very high, when a man had several wives, they were able to raise the children together in that event. Supporters of polygyny also argue that raising children is much easier, when the work involved is shared amongst several ‘sister wives’\nOpinion here is divided, but as for myself, when I researched it, I actually discovered something that I did not expect. In the first instance, it may seem like every man’s dream to have several wives, but in practice, it is not all about more ‘slap and tickle’ it is a greater responsibility. Assuming that you do take the responsibility seriously, it can be a great burden to provide for several women, when many men struggle to provide for one! On top of this, it seems that when women live together in one household, there is evidence that for some unknown reason, their biological clocks begin to run in sync, that for you my friends means the prospect of two, three or four women menstruating AT THE SAME TIME!!!! Now that’s a thought that absolutely terrifies me.\nThere was another factor that was eventually addressed by governments, behind the scenes, without any form of public admission. When men could marry more than one woman, it meant that invariably, the small percentage of wealthy men could take their pick of the women, resulting in societies where twenty percent of the men had their choice of eighty percent of the women. This left the vast majority of men with no wives, no family and no responsibility, which resulted in large numbers of bandits, rapists and drunks, who had no purpose in life.\nAlthough the official narrative was that the reasons behind the ending of polygyny was a religious one, with the Church dictating its usual self-righteous autonomy on everyone, the real reasons were in fact much more deeply rooted in government policy. By ending the right for men to have more than one wife, they ended the 80/20 cycle, ensuring that the majority of women could not chase the few eligible men, making them available for everyday men, which resulted in the vast majority of men having the opportunity to raise their own family. Let’s not ignore the fact that by ensuring that all these men were occupied providing for their families, it also meant that they were not free to roam, steal or perhaps raise an army and topple the government, things are not always as they seem.\nThe formation of the Women’s Social and Political Union (Suffragettes)\nLet’s skip all the social, political and economical factors that were a constant threat to every day families over the centuries and skip to the twentieth century. in 1903 its membership and policies were tightly controlled by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia (although Sylvia was eventually expelled).\nBy this time, women around the world were being granted the vote, but in the UK, they had not, this was draconian to say the least, even at that time, but despite the gallant efforts of the Suffragettes, women were not granted the vote until 1928. The first battle had been won, but the war was not over yet. Over the next few decades, there were incremental concessions made to women, slowly but surely, although it was not until the Equality and Pay Act 1970 that women were finally granted the right to equal pay and terms in the workplace, although in practice, the battle continued.\nAround the same time, the Abortion Act 1967 gave women the right to choose, something that they must have the right to do, but there have been social side-effects that exploded exponentially.\nAs women’s rights gained traction, there was less and less need for them to rely on men, they were no longer dependants, they were becoming equal partners, something that is very admirable in principle, but how did that work in practice?\nOver the next decade, women were able to walk away from unhappy marriages, because they could work, support themselves and would not be left destitute, this resulted in the number of divorces rising and rising.\nAs the battle for equality continued, we entered the 1980s, when the movement changed in to what is known as ‘Third Wave Feminism’ which saw an admirable cause hijacked by a more hostile misandrycal motive. From that time, the rights of men have been slowly eroded, with many men finding themselves completely ruined by divorce, their rights to see their own children abused and many were held to ransom by the ‘Child Support Agency’ which were able to impose ridiculous terms upon them, this in turn, resulted in suicides among men rising to an all time high. In the 90s, the CSA had its powers clipped a little, giving men a breather, but nevertheless, men with children suffer tremendously in divorce.\nWith the numbers of divorces rocketing and an increasing number of women choosing to have children out of wedlock, there are now more women than ever raising children alone. The consequences of this being so far reaching that many of which are never even discussed, in the modern day, raising an argument that contradicts ‘the narrative’ can be very dangerous, so people tend to keep quiet.\nWe now have a society where there are millions of ‘floating mothers’ single parents, looking for a relationship, trying to tie down men who really don’t want or care for their children, making do with ‘Beta males’ who they would not have given the time of day to, a decade earlier. These men make ideal ‘lifeboats’ to ferry them to the proverbial dry land, when their children are grown up, by that time, many of them are dispensable and more often than not, they suddenly become surplus to requirements when they are no longer needed.\nLet’s REALLY step out on to thin ice\nAsk any mother where her loyalties lie and the answer will invariably be with her children. This is not only admirable, but it is a vital element of a successful marriage and family, however, for single mothers, the dynamics change. They are now in a position of wanting to tie down a man to take responsibility for someone else’s children, something that goes against nature itself, after all, when a Lion takes over a pride, the first thing it does is to kill the Cubs, to win the loyalty of the Lioness. I’m not advocating this of course, I’m simply making a comparison in nature.\nThroughout the centuries, women have made incredible sacrifices for their children, they have married for them, divorced for them, sold their bodies and souls for them, betrayed their loved ones, their friends or even their own country. That is not a criticism, it is a fair description of the degree of devotion that mothers instinctively have for their children. As a father, I would respect my wife for demonstrating that degree of devotion to my children (or child in my case) although I had the misfortune of marrying one of the few mothers who did not have any loyalty to her own child, but that’s another story.\nWhilst all of this is commendable, how does this change when mothers are divorced or single? If we accept the notion that the true loyalties of mothers are with their children, then we must also accept that a single man who gets in to a relationship with a mother, will never have her true loyalty and her loyalties lay with children that are not his. This results in relationships where the man is devoted to a woman, who is not in turn devoted to him, but to her children. To put it another way, (and I have in the past) if you were in Shark infested waters with a mother, don’t expect her to save you, but rather sacrifice you to save her children.\nRather cynical isn’t it? that’s true, but cynicism is an acute perception of the truth, or something that an optimist calls a realist! Okay, but how does this effect divorced or single mothers though? Firstly there is the pressure of keeping a lid on the dynamics of a relationship that is little more than a logistical ‘sticky plaster’ but also, raising children in a home where they can be alone with a man who is not their father.\nThe incidence of abuse by step-parents (it’s not just step-dads) is many times higher than by their biological parents. The ‘replacement dads’ may make every effort to care for these children, but no matter what they do, their biological father is their father, full stop. You can devote time and effort to them, but their father can turn up with a some junk bought at a market and they will treasure it, because it is from their dad! (I can vouch for this as I’ve been there)\nThe domestic consequences are relationships that struggle to pass the test of time, relationships that become even more complicated if the couple then go on to have another trophy child to give their new relationship a physical bond, then all hell breaks loose, when you have different dads., mums, step parents and who knows what involved. We have been sold this as the modern family, I would term it to be a modern day biological mess.\nThese relationships have even less chance of success than a marriage, but there is actually a far worse social consequence, that is not discussed.\nFull circle to the 80/20 society\nNow that society has moved to the proverbial left, and women are encouraged to be ‘sexually liberated’ spending their youth sleeping around with no concerns about marriage, or family, inspired by the toxic element of society, there is less or no need for men to marry.\nIn reality, that which was portrayed to ’empower’ women may have ultimately enslaved them. The latest generation of under 40s, and definitely under 30s have no inclination to take responsibility, men have withdrawn from relationships and life as a whole. We have Tinder where potential partners are paraded like a sales channel, but how do we make our choices when all we are presented with is visual? We first begin to covet what we see and if all we are presented with is visual, then that is how we make our choices. It does not matter how kind you are, how educated or moral you are, on Tinder, you are just another image vying for attention.\nAs men are free to sleep around thanks to willing females who are prepared to offer themselves to them, there is no need for them to offer anything, in return, is there?\nNo there is not!\nWhilst men may have it made on the face of things, have they really? If women are free to sleep with whomsoever they wish, they will and do invariably choose the most appealing option. We need only look at the images on social media to see what young women aspire to, the glam, the ostentatious, the labels, the cars and the locations, but what does that mean? It means that society has regressed back to the 80/20 with the vast majority of women pursuing the minority of men, provided they are eligible of course, but what makes them eligible?\nOnce again, a quick look at social media reveals all, women increasingly making desperate attempts to grab attention from men, who are already inundated with single women. They must be young, single, slim, with curves in the right places and make open and public gestures of their willing sexual intentions, or the will simply be left swiped!\nIn this age of female empowerment, we have also witnessed a climate of female delusion, look at any dating site and check out the requirements made by women. If you look at slightly more conservative cultures, you will see a woman looking for a man to settle down with and have a family, she may be aged 25 and looking for a man from 25 to 40, for example. Then check the women in more western societies, after a long list of pre-requisites, you will invariably see, woman aged 45, looking for a man from 29 to 45, delusion has taken over the asylum. We may have been swayed by the odd freak stomach turning situation where an obviously damaged young man in his 30s enters a relationship with a women in her 60s, but the reality of these situations just does not bare thinking about, all I can say is that Viagra must surely save the day!\nAs women have fallen for the notion of empowerment, men have had no need to be men, in fact they are disappearing at an alarming rate, being replaced by weak, irresponsible abominations who would never have the honour to take a bullet for the one they love, they would be hard pushed to put them ahead of their games console!\nTherefore, it is not difficult to understand that both sexes (yes there are only two) are victims of this culture of freedom, but the greatest irony is yet to come. One of the most common reason that women (who instigate most divorces) do actually file for divorce is infidelity.\n“If he cheated on you, then you MUST divorce him and punish him!”\nFair enough, this is commonplace and there will never be a society where men are not tempted by the ways of Eros, unless there is a society without men (now there’s a thought) but isn’t it ironic that these women who so eagerly divorce the man they love, because he was tempted to do that which is natural, will then happily sleep with other men who were sleeping with another ‘hook-up’ from Tinder the night before and probably another on the next night.\n“I won’t stand for that” I hear you cry!\nI’m sorry to say that you will, time and time again, because once you are divorced or beyond the accepted ‘Instagram aesthetic’ you will have no choice, you either join a long line of bedfellows, accept celibacy and suffer or settle for a beta male that really doesn’t do it for you, but what about the men?\nThey are not as well off as they think, with more and more men are falling in to the category of the 80%, they are disposable, even when they do manage to enter a relationship, they are treated like a doormat, because they are not really their partner’s first choice, she wants the illusion of the images she sees on social media and compared to them, you sir, are a failure, a deadbeat, you do not satisfy her sexually like Christian Grey (who would have been deemed a deviant if he were not a billionaire) but that’s another matter.\nThe numbers of disenfranchised men is increasing at an alarming rate, along with a falling birth rate. Governments around Europe have tried to plug the gap by allowing millions of immigrant men to enter their countries, despite their rhetoric this is planned, and many women are willingly jumping in to bed with them, but over the last few decades, Europe has seen an explosion of immigrants who come from cultures that do not respect women whatsoever, cultures that sentence their children to a lifetime of confusion and prejudice. The increasing levels of misogyny are alarming, but the media hide this of course, yet we all know, don’t we?\nAs the number of men who give up on life increases, so does the crime, the lack of social order and the breakdown of the family. In time, this would leave the government no option but to implement a dystopian society, to restore order for our own safety, which I am certain they would not wish to do, would they?\nConclusion\nI must apologise for the cynical undertone of my words, but some things need to be said, or more importantly, they need to be addressed, before society goes in to meltdown. Every time a man is taken to the cleaners in a divorce court, it may be one point to the plaintiff, but it is another nail in the coffin that was society. If marriage were a business contract, only an idiot would sign it.\nI fervently believe that there is nothing more beautiful in life than to pledge your heart and soul to a woman who you will live and die for. I was never lucky enough to have this, but that does not prevent me from believing in it, supporting it and suggesting that we should all do our level best to protect this tradition that is as much a part of humanity as birth and death.\nThe moral is that society needs to re-enforce this to the young, to encourage them and assist them in every way possible to achieve this, the most fundamental of life’s goals. We must cease to aspire to this Bacchanalian society that will surely be our doom. I am repeating myself once again, but I cannot emphasise this enough, where society regresses back to the 80/20, it creates a mass of women throwing themselves at men, to the detriment of their self-respect, their honour and their principles, whilst concurrently creating a mass of men who have nothing to work for, nothing to live for and nothing to strive for.\nFinal thoughts:\nWhen a man pledges his love to a young woman, he will forever see that young woman, who will invariably become all the more beautiful in the fullness of time, as she bears his children, but when a man glances at a photo of an older woman online he does not see a woman who was his bride, how many more reasons do you need to stop casting off men so easily, the grass is not Greener, it never is.\nSome of the most amazing achievements made by men have been for the love of a woman, but in the end, they are men, they will be tempted, they will make mistakes, they will fall prey to temptation, so the dilemma here is, should society understand that and stop encouraging women to walk away at a drop of a hat, or should we continue on our current course of social, moral and domestic Armageddon?\nI love the way this is written, it has really made me thing!\nThank you very much, I strongly believe that we should be discussing this as a society, because we are being distracted, side-tracked and being sold a lie.\nMarriage is a wonderful institution, but who wants to live in an institution?\nFor many, many couples they think after the announcement of their engagement that the wedding is the next step, but is it?\nWhy rush? It makes me laugh when the church acknowledges that you and your fiance are sharing a bed but still insist the bride wears white, and of course, now the seed has been planted. You must get married yesterday..\nBoth sets of parents are preparing your wedding and the christening of their first grandchild with the help of the locals in the village.\nIt’s chaos..\nThe wedding day arrives, and you’re in a little white satin dressing gown that has BRIDE embroidered on it. You are watching your hairdressers, and the makeup artist makes you into this blushing bride you once dreamt of, but the reality hits home. You start to cry, but no one can see your tears as you have taught yourself to cry from the inside.\nNow it’s time to wear your bridal dress.\nShe insisted that her veil would cover her face and that she would meet her husband to be down the Isle and not at the church courtyard.\nShe also requested that all the guests would be seated inside the church and not hang around outside.\nEvery girls dream is to be walked down the Isle with her father.\nAfter the ceremony and the party come the morning after You are now Mr Mrs bla bla bla.\nBoth sets of parents are waiting for you to count the money Will you build or buy a key Ready home…Let’s see how much they made.\nSo, the decision has been made they’re building. More stress has more hassle more interference..\nWithin a couple of years, you have become parents. She thought this would change..\nShe had invested a lot into this marriage even though she shouldn’t of married him..\nShe tried to love him but it wasn’t enough and let’s be fair he didn’t fight for their marriage.\nResults to filing for a divorce..\nDivorce Is like you have an extremely large table filled with food and bam you got cake thrown in your face and bam he got slapped with the kippers..\nNow there’s no food on the table..Now what…\nExpensive fees are paid to the lawyers when in true honesty if they had removed their pride all this unwanted expenses could of gone to your children.\nHow some male’s respond..\nYou didn’t look like that when I first met you..No neither did you but I had our children I work I’m a mother I’m tired what’s your excuse..\nBefore you know it you have made more enemies than you ever imagined..\nIf you’re going to get married think carefully..\nWould I ever get married again 🤔\nWatch this space..\nInteresting point Mary, empowerment should have been the freedom to choose who to marry for the right reasons, it should have been about addressing some of the problems that everyone faces, but what we have seen is the destruction of the family en-mass!\nI could go on about this for hours, but I wont!\nI’ve always said this, the day women found independence, the scales became uneven!\nwhen a couple married, they made a pact! They knew their place! The woman looked after the home and children, The men made the money, maintained the house and cars.\nThe day women showed they were capable of doing all these things themselves, they took their manhood and also burden themselves with additional responsibilities to prove they could do it! Hence the birth of the Manchild! Now he hasn’t got the weight of providing for the family on his own, he gets more relaxed.\nThe couple are no longer a 50/50 team! She is driving and he’s along for the ride!\nAnyway!!\nAnthony! I enjoyed reading this, although I will admit when I was reading it in my head it was in the voice of Carrie from Sex and the city!

The sums of money being discussed are truly eye-watering, with figures that would have been politically unthinkable mere weeks ago.\nOne leaked plan for German rearmament currently circulating in Berlin proposes a staggering €400bn (£330bn) blitz of additional expenditure on national defence, buttressed by another €500bn intended to rebuild Germany’s crumbling infrastructure. Such massive investment would represent a fundamental shift in German fiscal policy and defence posture, marking a dramatic departure from decades of military restraint.\nAnother leaked plan, revealed by the respected Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, discusses the possibility of converting Italy’s struggling automotive industry into a revamped ecosystem of weapons production. Under this ambitious proposal, subcontractors across the industrial heartlands of Lombardy and the Veneto would supply German armaments plants much as they currently supply car components for Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW. This industrial transformation would preserve manufacturing jobs whilst bolstering Europe’s defence capabilities.\n“It is becoming obvious to everybody that defence spending is the way to offset job losses in the car industry,” observed Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg Bank, highlighting the economic logic behind these sweeping proposals.\nWhat is also becoming increasingly evident is that Donald Trump either actively desires a Russian victory in Ukraine, or is so besotted with the television reality show spectacle of his peace deal that he would willingly smash America’s alliance system out of pique if thwarted. This realisation has sent shockwaves through European capitals, forcing a dramatic reconsideration of strategic autonomy.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, joined the bidding on Tuesday with an €800bn “Rearm Europe Plan” using emergency powers under Article 122 of the Treaties, the immediate riposte to Trump’s overnight outrage. The speed and scale of the response demonstrates just how seriously European leaders are taking the new geopolitical reality.\nFunds are to be rushed into air defence systems, artillery pieces, precision missiles and advanced drones, with a target of raising average EU military budgets by 1.5 percentage points of GDP over the next four years. Whilst the specific mechanisms remain somewhat vague at this early stage, the direction of travel is unmistakably clear: Europe is preparing to defend itself.\nThe immense figures under discussion in Berlin would have been politically unthinkable a week ago, before the total loss of faith in American friendship. This represents a seismic shift in European strategic thinking, with profound implications for the continent’s economic and defence policies.\nIf enacted on anything close to this ambitious scale, such a high-octane blast of military Keynesianism will entirely change the economic and geopolitical shape of the world. Indeed, it is the coming boom in Europe that savvy investors should all be betting on, as defence spending has historically proven to be a powerful economic stimulant.\nBavaria’s premier Markus Söder has emerged as the weather-vane of our times, leading the call for a full-blown revival of German military power along with a joint nuclear deterrent in concert with France and the United Kingdom. His dramatic shift in position reflects the new consensus forming across the political spectrum.\n“We need a drone force of 100,000 drones, 800 new tanks, 2,000 Patriot missiles and 1,000 Taurus just for Germany as a protective shield like the ‘Iron Dome’. Only the strong will be taken seriously,” Söder declared, articulating a vision of European military capability that would have been unthinkable in German politics just months ago.\nEurope finds itself in roughly the same position today as America did in 1939, when the US defence budget amounted to a mere 2 per cent of GDP and the miniscule US army ranked alongside the Belgian army in terms of size and capability. American military spending subsequently rose dramatically, reaching 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1941, 16 per cent in 1942, 35 per cent by 1943 and peaking at an extraordinary 41 per cent in 1945. This historic precedent demonstrates how quickly advanced economies can shift to a war footing when necessity demands.\nThe American defence surge was led by William Knudsen of General Motors, the corporate titan of the age who took the job at the US war department for a patriotic salary of just $1. Tasks were divided amongst the industrial giants of the era, with each focusing on specific military needs. Ford built the biggest factory the world had ever seen at Willow Run in Michigan, capable of producing a four-engine B-24 Liberator bomber every hour by 1944, an astonishing feat of industrial engineering.\nChrysler rolled out the M3 medium tank through the freezing winter of 1941 in a factory that still lacked walls, showcasing American industrial determination. The subsequently developed Chrysler M4 Sherman, with a motor powered by five six-cylinder engines ingeniously welded together, became the workhorse of allied armour, supplied to the British, Canadians, Poles and Free French forces throughout the conflict.\nWhilst technology is undoubtedly more complex today, the fundamental idea remains much the same. “It won’t be car factories suddenly making tanks, but suppliers have skilled labour that can be switched to defence as the auto industry shrinks,” explained Mr Schmieding, highlighting the potential for industrial transformation.\nIt was the war – not the New Deal – that ultimately lifted America out of the Great Depression. A similar military revival could potentially do much the same for a Europe that has been trapped in economic defeatism and learnt helplessness for nearly two decades. It represents a way of achieving the turbo-charged growth envisioned in the Draghi Plan by other means, through targeted investment in strategic industries.\nThe supposed trade-off between defence and welfare is widely regarded as one of the great fallacies of modern politics by economic historians. Defence spending, when properly directed, can drive broader economic growth and technological innovation.\nMuch of the technology underpinning US economic hegemony has its origins in Pentagon research programmes: the internet was initially an offshoot of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, conceived as a computation network within the US defence complex that could survive a nuclear first strike. This military innovation subsequently transformed the global economy.\nSilicon Valley, once a pastoral landscape of apricot orchards and a producer of a third of the world’s prunes, began making radars and aerospace components for the US government in the 1940s. It later turned to developing the integrated circuits needed by NASA and the Pentagon during the Cold War. Even Google’s origins can be traced back to grants from US agencies for intelligence surveillance technologies. Defence innovation has repeatedly proven to be a powerful driver of broader economic development.\nA comprehensive study of OECD member states published by MIT’s Review of Economics in January found that government spending on defence research consistently drives rapid productivity growth by crowding in higher private investment. The positive spillover effects extend far beyond the defence sector itself.\nThe moral of this economic story is that Europe can potentially kill two birds with one stone, defeating perma-slump at home and Putin’s predatory imperialism abroad simultaneously. A properly structured defence investment programme could revitalise European industry whilst bolstering security.\nSir Keir Starmer has already proclaimed this new Gospel in the United Kingdom, describing his Defence Industrial Strategy as the spearhead of economic growth and a path to leadership in crucial future technologies including artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This represents a significant evolution in Labour’s economic thinking.\nThe German plan for military and economic rearmament was meticulously drawn up by four leading institutes from across the political spectrum, specifically designed to hold the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats together in a grand coalition. This broad political consensus increases the likelihood of implementation.\nChancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz has jettisoned two of his core political doctrines in a matter of days: a lifelong defender of Atlanticism has all but given up on America; and a champion of ordoliberal fiscal rigour is suddenly searching for ways to amend the German constitutional debt-brake while there is still a chance in the old Bundestag. These dramatic shifts demonstrate the profound impact of recent geopolitical developments on European politics.\nThe timing is crucial, as once the new Bundestag takes over in late March, Putin-Versteher (Putin-sympathisers) on both the hard Left and the hard Right will likely have sufficient votes to block any significant changes to German defence policy. This narrow window of opportunity adds urgency to the rearmament plans.\nEurope will ultimately find the money for weapons because it simply has no choice in the face of growing threats. The necessity of self-defence will overcome traditional fiscal constraints.\nThe European Union currently has a €90bn line of untapped funding from the Covid recovery plan that can and will be repurposed for defence needs. Additionally, the bloc is sitting on approximately €200bn of frozen Russian assets that are likely to be tapped to pay for weapons sent to Ukraine and to beef up the formidable arms industry already created by the Ukrainians themselves, which must not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\nHalf the immediate task is to turn Ukraine into “a steel porcupine,” in Von der Leyen’s vivid phrasing, capable of deterring further Russian aggression through defensive capability.\nThe coalition of the willing will have to rearm mostly outside the formal EU structure given the vetoes of Hungary and the Russophile bloc within the Union. This will require new institutional arrangements to coordinate defence efforts.\nJoint debt issuance is undoubtedly needed to shield high-debt states from a potential bond market attack, but this can be accomplished through a new agency akin to development banks, and should sensibly include non-EU allies such as the United Kingdom, Norway and Canada. This would create a broader European security architecture beyond the confines of the European Union.\nThe technical details of financing are fundamentally trivial when viewed against the scale of the challenge. Non-US NATO members have a combined GDP of approximately $30 trillion (£24 trillion), a staggering 14 times the size of the Russian economy. This economic disparity means that a united Europe possesses the resources to effectively counter Russian aggression.\nEurope can bring Putin to the negotiating table by hammering him on two fronts simultaneously: firstly, through an arms race that Russia simply cannot afford to sustain given its smaller economic base; and secondly, through choking Putin’s vital oil revenue by paralysing his mercenary “dark fleet” of tankers in the Baltic, and by equipping Ukraine with missiles capable of reaching Russia’s Black Sea oil terminals. This dual approach would apply maximum pressure on the Russian economy.\nThe worst of all potential outcomes would be a false peace that neutralises Ukraine, leaving Putin free to rebuild his war machine while his arms factories continue firing on all cylinders. Such a scenario would merely postpone conflict whilst allowing Russia to prepare for future aggression.\nA premature ceasefire would potentially allow Putin to concoct a story of abuses against ethnic Russians in the Baltic states as a pretext for further attacks before Europe is sufficiently strong enough to hold the line. History has demonstrated the dangers of appeasing territorial aggression.\nThe coalition of the willing must now act with lightning speed to deter further aggression. Otherwise, Putin may be tempted to strike while he perceives he has a perishable advantage in military capability. Europe is approaching what military strategists would describe as the point of maximum danger, when deterrence is most likely to fail.\nThe rearmament of Europe represents not just a military response to Russian aggression, but potentially a transformative economic programme that could revitalise European industry, drive technological innovation, and create sustainable employment. The challenge will be to ensure that this massive investment is directed efficiently towards building genuine capability rather than being dissipated through bureaucratic inefficiency or corruption.\nFor the United Kingdom, newly outside the European Union but still a crucial European security partner, this presents both challenges and opportunities. Britain’s defence industry could benefit significantly from increased continental spending, but only if cross-Channel cooperation can overcome the political tensions of Brexit.\nThe coming years will likely see a fundamental restructuring of the European security architecture, with implications extending far beyond the continent itself. A more militarily capable Europe would alter the global balance of power, potentially reducing dependence on the United States whilst creating a more multipolar international system.\nThe question now is whether European leaders can summon the political will to follow through on these ambitious plans, overcoming decades of underinvestment in defence and the significant fiscal challenges involved. The answer will shape the continent’s future for generations to come.\nComment\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this will end badly, Germany rearmed will invariably become a threat, but add the autocracy of the EU to the mix and it will only be a matter of time before the treacherous EU will allow the increasing military power to go to their heads, creating a new pan-European threat.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_suella-calls-for-reform-and-the-conservatives-to-unite/content_968.html": "Suella calls for Reform and the Conservatives to unite\nBraverman Calls for Conservative-Reform UK Alliance During Trump Inauguration Visit\nIn a landmark interview during her Washington DC visit for Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has made a striking call for unity between the Conservative Party and Reform UK, suggesting this alliance represents the crucial formula for defeating Labour in upcoming elections.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Telegraph, Mrs Braverman outlined her vision for a dramatic realignment of Britain’s right-wing political landscape. Her comments come at a particularly sensitive moment for the Conservative Party, as current leader Kemi Badenoch grapples with declining poll numbers and mounting pressure from Reform UK’s growing influence.\n## Proposed Coalition Structure\nThe former Home Secretary elaborated on several possible formats for this proposed unity, demonstrating remarkable flexibility in her approach. “We need to come to some kind of accommodation,” she explained, outlining various potential structures:\n– A complete merger between the parties\n– A formal coalition arrangement\n– A supply and confidence agreement\n– A non-aggression pact\nMrs Braverman emphasised that while the exact mechanism remains open for discussion, the fundamental necessity for right-wing unity is paramount. “I don’t know what the precise form looks like,” she acknowledged, “but in general, I am in favour of unifying the Right.”\n## Personal Position and Reform UK\nAdding intrigue to her proposals, Mrs Braverman’s own political future appears increasingly fluid. She has notably declined to rule out the possibility of defecting to Reform UK, and when questioned about her future party affiliation, refused to confirm whether she would remain a Conservative MP through the end of the current Parliament.\nHer personal connection to Reform UK through her husband Rael’s defection to the party has been presented as evidence that such cooperation is viable. “The people who are in Reform are largely conservatives who have lost patience with our party and that’s our fault,” she observed, criticising fellow Tories who have dismissed Reform UK supporters.\n## Trump’s Influence and British Conservatism\nMrs Braverman’s Washington visit appeared to significantly influence her vision for British conservatism’s future direction. Dressed in what she self-deprecatingly described as a “Virgin Atlantic air stewardess” style Republican red suit, she praised Trump’s approach to governance and suggested British conservatives should embrace similar strategies.\nShe particularly emphasised Trump’s role in transforming political discourse: “Donald Trump has not just shifted the Overton window, he’s shattered it. He’s made the unsayable mainstream and he’s made the radical much more acceptable to the moderates.”\n## Policy Proposals\nDrawing inspiration from Trump’s presidency, Mrs Braverman outlined several bold policy positions:\n### International Relations\n– Advocated for UK withdrawal from the World Health Organisation\n– Expressed scepticism toward the Paris climate agreement\n– Suggested Britain should reconsider its net zero commitments\n### Domestic Policy\n– Called for the abolition of the Office of Budget Responsibility\n– Criticised current approaches to multiculturalism\n– Advocated for stricter immigration controls\n– Supported withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights\n## Political Strategy\nMrs Braverman emphasised the need for British conservatives to adopt what she termed an “anti-establishment” stance, suggesting they should “tear up the rule book” and embrace “raw and unfiltered conservatism.” She particularly praised Trump’s immediate executive actions, including his policy on gender recognition.\nHer criticism extended to Conservative colleagues who had previously embraced certain progressive positions, such as “taking the knee” or accepting certain contemporary gender theories, which she characterised as “errors of the past.”\n## Electoral Implications\nThe timing of Mrs Braverman’s comments carries particular significance given current polling data showing Reform UK gaining ground against the Conservatives. Her proposal for unity appears aimed at preventing a split in the right-wing vote that could benefit Labour in future elections.\n## Washington Visit Context\nMrs Braverman’s presence at the inauguration celebrations, including the Liberty ball, marked her as one of the most senior Tory MPs in attendance. She criticised senior Conservative figures, including Lord Hague and Michael Gove, for their previous support of Kamala Harris, suggesting this represented a misalignment with conservative values.\nIn a lighter moment, she noted her coincidental encounters with other British political figures in Washington, including sharing a flight with Laurence Fox and staying at the same Georgetown hotel as broadcaster Emily Maitlis, about whom she made somewhat sardonic comments regarding the liberal response to Trump’s victory.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-shifting-tide-of-public-sentiment-reflecting-on-brexits-impact/content_76.html": "The Shifting Tide of Public Sentiment – Reflecting on Brexit’s Impact\nIntroduction\nThe journey of Brexit, the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union, has been marked by twists and turns, from its initial conception to the present day. As the process unfolded, public sentiment experienced significant fluctuations, driven by a multitude of factors ranging from unmet expectations to the conduct of key leaders. In this blog post, we delve into the evolving public opinion surrounding Brexit, the reasons behind its shifting trajectory, and the potential implications for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.\nBrexit Unfolds: Initial Expectations and Skepticism\nThe downward trend in public sentiment surrounding Brexit began early on and persisted throughout its unfolding. The resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May in July 2019 fueled skepticism surrounding the decision, with more individuals expressing regret over the choice. While there were sporadic spikes in favor of Brexit, such as when the UK officially left the EU on March 31st, 2020, these moments of support were short-lived, and the overall trajectory favored those who believed Brexit was a mistake.\nFactors Fueling Dissatisfaction\nSeveral factors have contributed to the growing dissatisfaction with Brexit. One significant element is the perceived lack of tangible benefits. During the Brexit campaign, proponents argued that leaving the EU would bring economic advantages and greater sovereignty. However, over time, the promised benefits failed to materialize. The UK economy faced challenges, including sluggish growth, increased inflation, disrupted trade with the EU, and diminished foreign investments. These setbacks led many to question whether the potential gains outweighed the costs and uncertainties associated with Brexit.\nAnother key factor influencing public opinion is the conduct of prominent Brexit leaders. Boris Johnson, a central figure in the Leave campaign, initially promised to swiftly deliver Brexit and unite the country. However, his tenure as prime minister was marked by controversies and political turmoil. Issues like the Northern Ireland protocol, fishing rights tensions, and clashes with the EU eroded public confidence in the government’s ability to manage the consequences of Brexit effectively.\nErosion of Trust and Growing Skepticism\nThe resignations of Brexit leaders, including Johnson’s own ministers, further undermined public trust and contributed to the prevailing sentiment that Brexit was a misstep. While polls indicate a clear majority of people viewing Brexit as a mistake, it’s important to acknowledge that public opinion can evolve over time. Future developments and events could potentially reshape public sentiment.\nImpact of Long-Term Consequences\nThe long-term consequences of Brexit, such as its impact on trade, the economy, and the UK’s relationship with the EU, will continue to shape public perceptions and may influence the direction of UK politics in the years to come. The path ahead is uncertain, and the evolving dynamics of this relationship will undoubtedly be closely watched.\nChallenges to Rejoining the EU\nDespite the growing sentiment in favor of rejoining the EU, several factors hinder the immediate prospect of the UK returning to the union. Both major political parties in the UK, the Conservatives and Labour, currently do not advocate for rejoining. This lack of support, combined with the EU’s own challenges and concerns, presents significant obstacles to reentry.\nConclusion\nThe shifting tide of public sentiment surrounding Brexit has been a journey fraught with complexity, marked by both highs and lows. As we reflect on the evolving trajectory of opinions, several key takeaways emerge:\n– **Unfulfilled Promises:** The disillusionment stemming from unmet expectations, particularly regarding economic benefits and sovereignty, has played a significant role in shaping the public’s perception of Brexit.\n– **Leadership and Conduct:** The conduct of prominent Brexit leaders, once seen as champions of change, has become a point of contention, eroding trust and fueling skepticism about the feasibility of their promises.\n– **Economic Realities:** Economic challenges, such as sluggish growth, increased inflation, and disrupted trade, have underscored the complexity of disentangling from the EU and raised questions about the overall cost-benefit equation.\n– **Challenges to Rejoining:** While public sentiment appears to lean towards rejoining the EU, the path to reentry is fraught with obstacles. Major political parties’ lack of support and the EU’s own priorities create a complex landscape that may hinder immediate rejoining.\n– **Dynamic Nature of Public Opinion:** The journey of public sentiment is far from linear. As demonstrated by past fluctuations, public opinion remains dynamic, subject to the ebb and flow of political developments and external circumstances.\nAs we consider the trajectory of Brexit sentiment, it’s important to acknowledge that public perception is a dynamic force that can change with time and evolving circumstances. The impact of Brexit on the UK’s identity, economy, and global relationships is an ongoing narrative—one that will continue to unfold in ways we can only anticipate. In navigating this intricate landscape, policymakers and citizens alike must remain attuned to the multifaceted nature of Brexit’s effects, seeking a balanced approach to shaping the UK’s future course.",

Before you all begin to cheer, keep in mind this is Fishy Rishy we’re talking about; he is lying to you. He’s feeling a little unloved because his ratings have plummeted, and the rumor is that letters have been piling into the 1922 committee demanding that he resigns due to a lack of confidence. That shouldn’t really come as any surprise because, after all, he is a member of the party of a thousand backstabbers, all traitors just like him.\nBut back to these criminals. Where do you think they’re all going to go? Do you think that they’re all going to just suddenly get jobs and pay rent? No, indeed not. What will happen is that they are going to be pushed into local communities. They’re going to become the responsibility and the expense of local authorities. Yes, that’s your council tax money that should be going to schools for your children. It should be going to fix roads in your neighborhoods. It should be going towards your hospitals, your healthcare, your police forces, etc. It will now be helping to pay for these people to be living more discreetly so that we can’t pick on a hotel and say,\n“This hotel is full of criminals,”\nbecause they’ll be out there merging with the community until such time as they can raise the money to open their own barber shops and takeaways and so on and so forth to launder the money like so many others before them. We all know the high streets that are so familiar to us, and we all know exactly how it all works, although most people are too scared to speak up about it because they have become so gutless and so fearful of saying what needs to be said, and they are more concerned with saying what they think people want to hear. Unfortunately, despite this great deception, that’s the minority. The majority of people are sick to death of this, and they can see that this is almost a national social, political, and ethnic genocide in the making. Nobody could have been watching what has happened over the last two or three weeks in London, in the heart of our democracy, and not being angered by the contempt shown for our society: people boldly waving the flags of terrorists, supporting terrorists, and the police turning a blind eye, and those very same police officers intimidating, harassing, and even arresting British people for waving the flag of St George or the Union flag. This is where we are at.\n03:00: But here’s some food for thought: according to the UNHCR, there are over 110 million refugees around the world. There are also over 750 million people worldwide who have an interest or are planning to head for Europe, not just the UK. Despite the fact that Bognor is quite appealing this time of year, there are other places in Europe equally as appealing. How many can Europe take before it is overrun with nutters who have come here with no intention to integrate and respect the host country in any way, shape, or form?\nIt is time for people to realise that it is not racist to want to protect your country. It is not racist to want to protect the entire continent of Europe from these people who are happy to just move here and breed themselves into the majority. Or rather, that’s their plan; their words, not mine. Go look it up for yourselves. Just remember, “racist” is a word used by those who do not want other people to hear what you have to say. Even on this thread, give it a few days and look through the thread, and you’ll see them appear one by one with no photo or an icon or something, people who wouldn’t dare show their face, and their comments will speak for themselves.\nAnd as I’ve said before, where they appear intending to raise questions about me, they actually answer questions about themselves. You need to all open your eyes, and you need to stand up and fight, not just for the UK but for the whole of the European continent before it is too late. If there’s one thing that the last two or three weeks should have taught us all, it’s that there are people out there who have no intention to live in peace with any culture that is different from their own.\nThere are people walking our streets in this country who have made their intentions, their lack of respect, and indeed their contempt crystal clear. If you do not open your eyes to it, if you do not hear what they are saying, then you are putting not just yourselves but your children and your grandchildren’s future in jeopardy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thank you very much. Bye-bye for now, and I’ll see you next time.",

His parents came from the small village of Agioi Vavatsinias, in the district of Larnaca, Cyprus. Loizos moved to Athens at the age of 17 intending to study pharmacology but soon gave up his studies in order to concentrate on his musical career. He was a self-taught musician, with no formal musical arts training. His first recordings were made in 1963 but he started gaining a larger audience after 1967.\nBy 1975 Loizos had become one of the most popular artists in Greek music.\nHe died on 17 September 1982 in a hospital in Moscow, Soviet Union after suffering several strokes. He was well known for his leftist political ideology and was an outspoken critic of the Greek military junta. He was also an active member of the Greek Communist Party. The year 2007 was declared “Manos Loizos Year” in Greece.\nDiscography\nHe composed many well-known Greek songs and has co-operated with various important composers, singers and lyricists like Mikis Theodorakis, Haris Alexiou, George Dalaras, Vasilis Papakonstantinou, Christos Leontis, Fondas Ladis, Yannis Negrepontis, Manolis Rasoulis, Giannis Kalatzis, Nâzım Hikmet and many others. His best known co-operation was with his very personal friend, lyricist Lefteris Papadopoulos who wrote the lyrics of many of Loizos’ most successful hits.\nSome of Loizos’ most famous songs are :\n“Ola se thymizoun (Everything Reminds Me of You)” Lyrics: Manolis Rassoulis\n“Jamaica” Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos\n“S’ Akoloutho (I follow you)” Lyrics: himself\n“To Akordeon (The Accordion)” Lyrics: Yannis Negrepontis\n“O Dromos (The Street)” Lyrics: Kostoula Mitropoulos\n“Che” (dedicated to Che Guevara) Lyrics: himself\n“Ah Helidoni mu (Ah, my swallow)” Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos\n“De Tha Ksanagapiso (I Shall not Love Again)” Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos\n“Paporaki tou Burnova (Paporaki of Burnova)” Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos\n“O Koutalianos” Lyrics: Lefteris Papadopoulos\n“Evdokia” (Instrumental Zeibekiko)\nIn 1985, a big concert dedicated to his memory took place in the Athens Olympic Stadium, attended by more than 50,000 people with singers George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Giannis Kalatzis, Dimitra Galani and Vasilis Papakonstantinou performing.

The bishop claimed that homosexuality is transferred to unborn children if a pregnant woman has anal sex, a comment that has no basis in science.\nProdromou said the bishop’s remarks “insult the dignity and injures the reputation” of many citizens and should be retracted. He said Cyprus’ human rights commissioner also considers the remarks discriminatory.\nThe bishop was speaking at a June lecture, citing what he said were an Orthodox saint’s views about homosexuality.\nBishop Neophytos of Morphou made the ridiculous statement while speaking at a primary school in Akaki, Cyprus in June—the same event in which he made his claim about pregnant women.\nIn a video, released by Accept – LGBTI Cyprus, Neophytos tells the story of a “very handsome young man” who visited a “holy monk.”\n“As he walked by… the monk said to him: ‘Young man I need to tell you… stop what you’re doing,’” Neophytos said.\n“‘What am I ?’ Replied the young man.\n“’This sleeping around. You’ll catch something, a disease, and die young. You should repent. There is joy in repenting.’\n“‘How do you know what I’ve been doing?’ Replied the young man.\n“‘God showed me,’ said the monk. ‘As you walked by me, you had a nasty smell. These acts you’re doing, laying with men have a specific stink which I recognise. This is how holy men receive information from God.’”\nAccording to the bishop, the young man in the story was “helped by his family’s prayers and stopped his acts.”\nGreek bishop mocked for anti-LGBT claims\nAfter the initial video of Neophytos making his pregnancy claim was shared on social media earlier in June, many were quick to ridicule him.\n“My mother has a lot of explaining to do,” joked journalist Benjamin Butterworth.\n“Dread to think what my mum did to make me bisexual,” replied Robert Davey, a UK Bi Pride trustee, while LGBT rights group ACCEPT asked: “How are lesbians created?”\nLegendary human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell reminded followers of the seriousness of the bishop’s claims.\n“Just say no to religious homophobes & fundamentalists,” he tweeted.\nCyprus decriminalised homosexuality in 1998 and outlawed discrimination based on gender and sexuality in 2004, however the Orthodox church views same-sex relations as immoral.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_10-simple-steps-to-self-motivation/content_389.html": "Every day of your life you are selling yourself, nothing happens until you’re successful at doing that.\nWe’re all in the selling business whether we like it or not. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a lawyer or an accountant, a manager or a politician, an engineer or a doctor.\nWe all spend a great deal of our time trying to persuade people to buy our product or service, accept our proposals or merely accept what we say. Before you get better at persuading or influencing other people – you need to get better at self-motivation and selling yourself.\nHere are 10 simple steps to self-motivation:\n#1 – You must believe in the product\nSelling yourself is pretty much like selling anything. Firstly, you need to believe in what you’re selling. That means believing in “you.” It’s about lots of positive self-talk and the right attitude. The first thing people notice about you is your attitude. If you’re like most people then you’ll suffer from lack of confidence from time to time.\nIt really all comes down to how you talk to yourself. The majority of people are more likely to talk to themselves negatively than positively – this is what holds them back in life. It isn’t just about a positive attitude; it’s about the right attitude – the quality of your thinking.\nSuccessful people have a constructive and optimistic way of looking at themselves and their work. They have an attitude of calm, confident, positive self-expectation. They feel good about themselves and believe that everything they do will lead to their inevitable success.\nIf you’re in a sales job or a business owner or a manager then you need to continually work on your attitude. You need to listen to that little voice inside your head. Is it saying you’re on top, going for it and confident, or is it holding you back.\nIf you’re hearing – “I can’t do this or that” or “They won’t want to buy at the moment” or “We’re too expensive” then you’d better change your self-talk or change your job.\nStart to believe in yourself and don’t let things that are out with your control effect your attitude. Avoid criticising, condemning and complaining and start spreading a little happiness. Remember the saying of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company – “If you believe you can do a thing, or if you believe you can’t, in either case you’re probably right.”\n#2 – The packaging must grab attention\nLike any other product we buy, the way the product is packaged and presented will influence the customer’s decision to buy.\nEverything about you needs to look good and you must dress appropriately for the occasion. And don’t think that just because your customer dresses casually, that they expect you to dress the same way.\nThe style and colour of the clothes you wear, your spectacles, shoes, briefcase, watch, the pen you use, all make a statement about you.\n#3 – Smile\nNo need to get carried away, you don’t need a big cheesy grin, just a pleasant open face that doesn’t frighten people away.\n#4 – Use names\nUse the customers name as soon as you can but don’t over do it. Business is less formal nowadays however be careful of using first names initially. Make sure your customer knows yours and remembers it. You can do the old repeat trick -“My name is Bond, James Bond” or “My name is James, James Bond”\n#5 – Watch the other person\nWhat does their body language tell you? Are they comfortable with you or are they a bit nervous? Are they listening to you or are their eyes darting around the room. If they’re not comfortable and not listening then there’s no point telling them something important about your business. Far better to make some small talk and more importantly -get then to talk about themselves.\nIt’s best to go on the assumption that in the first few minutes of meeting someone new, they won’t take in much of what you say. They’re too busy analysing all the visual data they’re taking in.\n#6 – Listen and look like you’re listening.\nMany people, particularly men, listen but don’t show that they’re listening. The other person can only go on what they see, not what’s going on inside your head. If they see a blank expression then they’ll assume you’re “out to lunch.”\nThe trick is to do all the active listening things such as nodding your head, the occasional “UH-HUH” and the occasional question.\n#7 – Be interested.\nIf you want to be INTERESTING then be INTERESTED. This really is the most important thing you can do to be successful at selling yourself.\nThe majority of people are very concerned about their self-image. If they sense that you value them, that you feel that they’re important and worth listening to, then you effectively raise their self-image. If you can help people to like themselves then they’ll LOVE you.\nDon’t fall into the trap of flattering the other person, because most people will see right through you and they won’t fall for it. Just show some genuine interest in the customer and their business and they’ll be much more receptive to what you say.\n#8 – Talk positively.\nDon’t say – “Isn’t it a horrible day” or “Business is pretty tough at present” or any thing else that pulls the conversation down. Say things like (and only the truth) – “I like the design of this office” or “I’ve heard some good reports about your new product.”\n#9 – Mirror the other person\nThis doesn’t mean mimicking the other person, it just means you speaking and behaving in a manner that is similar to the customer. For example, if your customer speaks slowly or quietly, then you speak slowly or quietly. Remember people like people who are like themselves.\n#10 – Warm and friendly\nIf you look or sound stressed or aggressive then don’t be surprised if the other person gets defensive and less than willing to co-operate. If you look and sound warm and friendly, then you’re more likely to get a positive response. This isn’t about being all nicey-nicey. It’s about a pleasant open face or a warm tone over the telephone.\nBefore we can get down to the process of selling our product, our service or our ideas then we need to be as sure as we can be – that the customer has bought us and that we have their full attention.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_born-to-hate-jews-a-story-of-a-british-muslim/content_371.html": "Born to Hate Jews – A story of a British Muslim\nHere is a story of a British Muslim, Kasim Hafeez, who experienced a journey of learning about Judaism.\nI was born to hate Jews. It was part of my life. I never questioned it. I was not born in Iran or Syria. I was born in England. My parents moved there from Pakistan. Theirs was the typical immigrant story: Move to the West in the hope of making a better life for themselves and their children.\nWe were a devout Muslim family, but not extremist or radical in any way. We only wished the best for everyone—everyone except the Jews. The Jews, we believed, were aliens living in stolen Muslim land, occupiers who were engaged in a genocide against the Palestinian people. Our hatred, therefore, was justified and righteous. And it made me and my friends vulnerable to the arguments of radical extremists. If the Jews were as evil as we had always believed, mustn’t those who support them—Christians, Americans, and others in the West—be just as evil?\nBeginning in the 1990s, speakers and teachers at mosques and in schools began to endlessly repeat this theme: We were not Western. We were not British. We were Muslims, first and only. Our loyalty was to our religion and to our fellow Muslims. We owed nothing to the Western nations that welcomed us. As Westerners, they were our enemies.\nAll of this had its desired effect. At least, it did on me. It changed the way that I saw the world. I began to see the suffering of Muslims, including in Britain, as the fault of Western imperialism. The West was at war with us, and the Jews controlled the West. My experience at university in Britain only enhanced my increasingly radical beliefs. Hating Israel was a badge of honor. Stage an anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian rally, and you were sure to draw a large, approving crowd.\nWhile at university, I decided the protests and propaganda against Israel were not enough. True jihad demanded violence. So I made plans to join the real fight. I would leave college and join a terrorist training camp in Pakistan. But, fortunately for me, fate intervened—in a bookstore.\nI came across a book called “The Case for Israel” by Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. The case for Israel? What case could there be? The title itself made me furious, and I began to read the pages almost as an act of defiance. How ill-informed, how stupid, could this guy be to defend the indefensible? Well, he was a Jew. That had to be the answer. Still, I read. And what I read challenged all of my dogmas about Israel and the Jews: I read that it wasn’t Israel that created the Palestinian refugee crisis; it was the Arab countries, the United Nations, and the corrupt Palestinian leadership. I read that Jews didn’t exploit the Holocaust to create the state of Israel; the movement to create a modern Jewish state dated back to the 19th century, and ultimately to the beginnings of the Jewish people almost 4,000 years ago. And I read that Israel is not engaged in genocide against the Palestinians. On the contrary, the Palestinian population has actually doubled in just twenty years.\nAll this did was make me angrier. I needed to prove Dershowitz wrong, to see with my own eyes how racist and oppressive Israel really was. So I bought a plane ticket. I would travel to Israel, the home of my enemy. And that’s when everything changed. Everything.\nWhat I saw with my own eyes was even more challenging than what Dershowitz had written. Instead of apartheid, I saw Muslims, Christians, and Jews coexisting. Instead of hate, I saw acceptance, even compassion. I saw a raucous, modern, liberal democracy, full of flaws, certainly, but fundamentally decent. I saw a country that wanted nothing more than to live in peace with its neighbors. I saw my hatred melting before my eyes. I knew right then what I had to do.\nToo many people on this planet are consumed with the same hatred that consumed me. They have been taught to despise the Jewish State—many Muslims by their religion; many others by their college professors or student groups.\nSo here is my challenge to anyone who feels this way: do what I did—seek out the truth for yourself. If the truth can change me, it can change anyone.\nI’m Kasim Hafeez for Prager University.\nDownload the book ‘A Case for Israel’ by Alan Dershowitz free here:",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-hostility-for-any-discussion-about-immigration/content_332.html": "The hostility for any discussion about immigration\nImmigration is one of the most divisive and emotionally-charged topics in the UK today. Any attempt at reasoned debate is often met with hostility, abuse and accusations of racism from those who seek to shut down discussion.\nThe Comment That Sparked This Post\nI recently received a critical comment on my YouTube channel from a lady called Celia, who took offence at my video discussing immigration. She accused me of being a “wannabe amateur politician” trying to fill the vacuum left by Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson.\nWhile I welcomed Celia’s differing viewpoint, her hostility highlights the inability of many to tolerate other perspectives on immigration. Rather than engage in constructive debate, they attack the speaker’s character and motives.\nThe Scale of Immigration Since 1997 Has Been Unprecedented\nIt’s undeniable that immigration to the UK has reached record levels over the past few decades. When Tony Blair’s government swept to power in 1997, one of their first acts was to open the floodgates to mass immigration.\nBlair could have eased restrictions gradually to allow society time to adapt. Instead, he sprang the policy on an unprepared nation almost overnight. Consequently, the UK has absorbed around 8 million immigrants since 1997.\nSuch rapid demographic change has placed public services under intolerable strain in many communities. Access to GPs, dentists, school places and other resources has become severely restricted due to excessive demand.\nThe Disproportionate Impacts On Some Areas\nCelia may reside in an affluent neighbourhood untouched by mass immigration. But for millions of Britons, their day-to-day lives have been radically transformed, often without consent.\nMany children now attend schools where English is a second language. Public spaces echo with foreign tongues. Local culture and customs have been displaced in some districts by those of newcomers.\nIt’s easy to dismiss these concerns when your own community has been shielded from the massive influx.\nOur Leaders Are In Denial\nCelia accused me of exploiting public anxiety about immigration with populist rhetoric. But leaders still refuse to acknowledge legitimate public unease.\nThey extol the economic benefits of mass immigration, while ignoring its social costs. They smear opponents as racists, bigots and xenophobes. They arrogantly lecture Britons that diversity is strength, denying any downsides.\nWith mainstream politicians living in denial, many voters feel disenfranchised and powerless. This has fuelled support for protest parties like UKIP.\nEurope Too Is Buckling Under The Strain\nThe UK is not alone in struggling to cope with mass inflows. Germany, France and other EU nations are now tightening borders and deporting illegal immigrants.\nItaly seethes with anger as 18,000 migrants amass on Lampedusa, while the EU breaches its own rules on burden-sharing. The Schengen zone is on the brink of collapse.\nEuropean leaders belatedly realise the EU’s open borders are unsustainable. But their voters’ patience has run out.\nDismissing Critics As Racist Stifles Honest Debate\nBy accusing immigration sceptics like myself of racism or xenophobia, critics seek to close down discussion entirely.\nBranding opponents as bigoted wrecks constructive debate. Some possess genuinely intolerant views, but most critics simply believe immigration must return to more sustainable levels. Dismissing them all as racist hard-right extremists is itself an extremist stance.\nCelia’s hostility typified this: rather than rationally challenge my arguments, she attacked my assumed motivations. This stifles free speech and thoughtful discourse.\nWhat Drives Such Zealous Pro-Immigration Views?\nIt’s worth analysing what motivates the most strident immigration advocates. Some feel a misplaced post-colonial guilt, believing the UK owes atonement to former subject peoples.\nOthers have a naive ‘citizen of the world’ mentality, dismissing national borders as artificial. Some activists pursue a political agenda, using immigration to undermine Western democracies.\nFew seem to prioritise the welfare and wishes of their fellow citizens over abstract globalist ideals. Their claimed compassion for immigrants seems absent for the communities disrupted by mass inflows.\nImmigration Needs Calm, Balanced Debate\nThe immigration debate has been framed in terms of polarised extremes: xenophobic anti-immigrant demagogues versus high-minded multiculturalists. Most Britons occupy the reasonable middle ground between these camps.\nWhat’s needed now is honest, thoughtful discussion. The costs and benefits, priorities and trade-offs of various policy options must be weighed dispassionately. And politicians must address voters’ legitimate concerns, not simply dismiss them as ignorant bigots.\nOnly then can we forge a measured, humane and sustainable immigration policy that commands broad public consent.",

Kevin Liser, formerly of New College Swindon, found himself embroiled in a controversy after referring to a student by an incorrect name and misgendering them. However, it wasn’t just this incident that led to his dismissal; Liser also faced allegations of refusing to acknowledge students who had chosen to undergo hormonal treatment for gender transition. Moreover, he went as far as equating the social transitioning of a child to the illegal act of performing female genital mutilation.\nThe repercussions of these actions were severe. Liser has been banned from teaching ever again, with an entry made on the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) register. This decision not only marks the end of his teaching career but also casts a shadow over his prospects for future employment, as the entry on the DBS register will likely affect his ability to secure various job opportunities.\nThe implications of this case extend beyond the individual involved. At its core, it raises questions about the boundaries of free speech within educational institutions and society at large. Liser’s supporters argue that his dismissal sets a dangerous precedent, effectively stifling dissenting opinions and imposing conformity to particular ideological viewpoints.\nAdding fuel to the fire are broader societal trends, particularly in the realm of legislation concerning hate speech and discrimination. Recent initiatives, such as the introduction of stringent hate crime laws in Scotland by Hamza Yusf, have heightened concerns about the erosion of civil liberties. Yusf’s directives, which include specialized police training in monitoring social media and targeting individuals deemed to be propagating hate speech, have been met with criticism from those who view them as infringing upon freedom of expression.\nCritics of such measures warn of a slippery slope, whereby the definition of hate speech is expanded to encompass dissenting opinions on various social and political issues. There are fears that legitimate discourse and debate could be suppressed under the guise of protecting marginalized communities. The specter of censorship looms large, with dissenting voices being marginalized and silenced in the name of political correctness.\nFurthermore, there is growing apprehension about the politicization of certain issues and the weaponization of identity politics for partisan gain. Allegations of selective outrage and hypocrisy abound, with accusations that certain groups are afforded preferential treatment while others are vilified and ostracized for expressing opposing views.\nAmidst these controversies, there is a pressing need for a nuanced and balanced approach that upholds the principles of free speech while also safeguarding the rights and dignity of all individuals. It is imperative to foster an environment where differing perspectives can coexist peacefully, without resorting to censorship or suppression of dissent.\nLooking ahead, the case of Kevin Liser serves as a sobering reminder of the complexities inherent in navigating the delicate balance between freedom of expression and respect for diversity. As debates rage on and tensions simmer, it is incumbent upon policymakers, educators, and society as a whole to engage in constructive dialogue and strive towards solutions that uphold the values of tolerance, inclusivity, and mutual respect. Only through such concerted efforts can we hope to forge a more equitable and harmonious future for all.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_absurd-un-asylum-rules-have-created-780m-refugees/content_799.html": "Absurd UN asylum rules have created 780m refugees\nThe Absurdity of Expanding Asylum Rights\nUK Home Secretary Suella Braverman recently gave a speech warning that the UN Refugee Convention has spiraled out of control. She argued that the convention, created after WWII to protect persecuted groups, now potentially applies to nearly 800 million people worldwide. This expansive interpretation incentivizes illegal migration flows that nations can no longer sustain. Reform is urgently needed to restore integrity to a broken system.\nA Convention Born From Necessity\nThe 1951 Refugee Convention established protections for around 2 million displaced Europeans in the aftermath of WWII and the Holocaust. It enshrined the moral imperative to provide safe harbor for those fleeing conflict and persecution. Signatory countries agreed to critical principles like non-refoulement – not returning refugees to dangerous conditions.\nAt the time, these protections were confined to Europe. But the 1967 Protocol expanded their scope globally. Subsequent legal challenges and reinterpretations further broadened the grounds for claiming asylum. Fear of discrimination due to being gay or a woman is now often sufficient, even without proven persecution.\nBy some estimates, these expanded criteria could allow nearly a tenth of the world’s population to potentially qualify as refugees. This was never the intent of the original convention. But its vague language opened the door to expansive modern interpretations.\nThe Distortion of Original Intent\nBraverman argued that the Refugee Convention now confers an assumed “right” to migration upon over 780 million people. This distorts the meaning of a refugee. Seeking economic betterment and fleeing life-threatening persecution are not equivalents. Neither is preemptively leaving your country versus needing immediate rescue from danger.\nBut legal precedent has muddled these distinctions. Now persecution is often presumed from broad social conditions like discrimination. And few challenge people transiting numerous safe countries before lodging asylum claims. Rarely are they facing imminent peril.\nBraverman contends that this status quo is legally absurd and operationally unsustainable. A convention designed to protect desperate European survivors now applies to nearly a tenth of humanity. This constitutes an unworkable obligation.\nThe Rise of Asylum Shopping\nAnother concern is asylum shopping. People now transit multiple safe countries to lodge claims in their destination of choice. Few boat migrants reaching the UK from France face immediate threats. But expansive asylum grounds mean they still receive refugee status.\nThis undermines the intent for people to seek refuge at the first opportunity. It also encourages economic migration under the guise of asylum. When claims are rubber stamped regardless of circumstances, it incentivizes exploitative people smuggling.\nEuropean countries never anticipated migration flows on today’s scale. Generous asylum practices made sense when claims were limited. But systems are buckling under expanding eligibility. Reform is needed to discourage those seeking better lives from claiming humanitarian protections.\nThe Overwhelming of Systems\nBraverman argues the status quo is unsustainable. Developed countries cannot provide welfare, housing, and integration support at current claim levels. Backlogs of cases also undermine timely processing of claims.\nBut even reasonable efforts to control flows draw criticism. Media vilify policies like offshore processing or deportation of fake claims. They demand “compassion” for all arrivals. But this mindset ignores that refugees languishing in camps also need help. Systems overwhelmed by new arrivals cannot deliver the care they advertise.\nWealthy nations have limited absorptive capacity. As numbers swell, public sentiment is shifting. Rightwing parties tap into resentment over perceived queue jumping by economic migrants. If asylum loses meaning, so may public support for helping true refugees. The convention’s viability hinges on restoring credibility to the system.\nReframing Global Approaches\nBraverman’s speech reflected a growing frustration with uncontrolled migration across the developed world. She argued that extraordinary times require rethinking conventional approaches to asylum. Possible reforms include:\n– Tighter adjudication of asylum claims to align with original persecution intent.\n– Fast track deportation of economic migrants who abuse the system.\n– Discouraging asylum shopping by requiring claims in first safe country.\n– Cooperating to return migrants to origin or transit countries.\n– Expanding refugee resettlement from crisis regions.\n– Containing flows before they reach destinations.\n– Greater burden sharing between nations.\nThese measures recognize that unregulated migration is politically unsustainable. Systems that maintain public faith in refugee protection are in everyone’s interest. But absence of controls erodes distinction between refugees and migrants. Restoring order is essential to manage flows humanely and effectively.\nA Delicate Balance\nCritics argue Braverman’s stance undermines refugee rights. But governments must balance compassion with border security. If asylum becomes an excuse for entry, it weakens will to help true refugees.\nAs migration crises mount worldwide, asylum access merits review. Relying on a 70-year-old convention without modern perspective is unrealistic. Reform is essential to avert collapse of refugee protection itself.\nSocieties that value diversity depend on public faith in immigration systems. Braverman rightly argues that current asylum practices erode this faith. Unchecked, resentment creates conditions for extremism to grow.\nProgressive change often requires revisiting assumptions. The Refugee Convention’s past nobility is unquestioned. But the future viability of asylum hinges on targeted reforms. These will reframe stagnant global approaches and rebuild confidence in refugee programs. With care and courage, governments can reclaim border integrity while honoring humanitarian ideals. The only unacceptable option is continued failure.",

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is probing a string of cover-up allegations by Detective Constable Wedger. He claims:\n● Police chiefs pulled the plug on his inquiry which revealed scores of sex offenders living on canal barges.\n● A pimp was free to groom teenage girls because a magistrate was an alleged client of one girl.\n● Vice squad officers were ordered not to arrest underage prostitutes.\n● Bosses made threats over his report on a London child prostitution ring involving “someone connected to the music department of the BBC”.\nDC Wedger said he first saw signs of “back covering” in his role as a CID officer tracking child sex offenders in the early 2000s. He said: “I found a lot of paedophiles were going off the radar.

The aim is to tackle the record backlogs that have plagued the system and provide quicker access to healthcare for millions of patients. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has laid out a plan to utilize the private sector’s resources and expertise to clear the waiting lists and offer patients greater choice and convenience. This article delves into the details of this revolutionary shift in the healthcare landscape and examines its potential impact on the future of the NHS.\nThe Need for Transformation\nWith waiting lists reaching a staggering 7.47 million, the urgency to address the challenges facing the NHS has never been more apparent. In an effort to learn from past experiences and to build on the successes of the Blair era, the government has established the Elective Recovery Taskforce. The Taskforce’s mandate is to explore innovative ways to leverage the independent sector’s capacity and resources to speed up diagnosis and treatment for patients.\nPrivate Sector Involvement: The Way Forward\nThe heart of the NHS’s transformation lies in partnering with private sector firms to establish community diagnostic centers (CDCs). These centers will serve as one-stop-shops for essential medical scans, tests, and checks, making it more convenient for patients to access timely healthcare close to their homes. The initial rollout of eight CDCs, carrying out over 400,000 diagnostics annually, sets the tone for a broader nationwide initiative.\nA Vision for the Future: Maximizing Spare Capacity\nThe NHS’s vision extends beyond a simple expansion of private clinics for NHS patients. The plan aims to unlock the full potential of the independent sector, ensuring a seamless integration of resources to match supply and demand in real-time. This involves utilizing dashboards to capture and manage data on spare capacity in both the NHS and private sector, leading to improved resource allocation and better patient outcomes.\nThe Path to a Wider Choice for Patients\nOne of the key tenets of this transformation is to empower patients by offering them a wider choice of healthcare providers. Starting from October, patients who have waited over nine months for an appointment will have the option to switch to a provider with a shorter waiting time. This patient-centric approach is expected to reduce waiting lists and enhance overall patient satisfaction.\nThe Role of NHS-Run Centres\nWhile the private sector expansion is a crucial aspect of the NHS transformation, the government is also committed to strengthening NHS-run diagnostic centers. The announcement of five new NHS-run centers in strategic locations across the country is a testament to this commitment. These centers, along with the existing ones, aim to deliver over 340,000 additional checks, tests, and scans, particularly focusing on early diagnosis of life-threatening conditions such as cancer.\nClearing the Backlogs: A Race Against Time\nThe pressure to clear the record waiting lists ahead of the next election is driving the government’s ambitious agenda. However, opposition parties argue that the government has been slow to act, with the potential to treat an additional 330,000 patients since January 2022 if independent sector capacity had been utilized earlier. In this article, we explore the merits and challenges of the government’s timeline and how it could impact the broader healthcare landscape.\nA Win-Win for Both Sectors\nThe collaboration between the NHS and the private sector is poised to create a win-win situation. While the private sector gains a significant boost to its business by providing services to NHS patients, the NHS benefits from increased capacity, faster diagnoses, and reduced waiting times. We examine the potential financial and operational implications of this partnership and how it can contribute to a more robust healthcare ecosystem.\nNavigating the Challenges\nAs with any major transformation, there will be challenges to address. From concerns about preserving the NHS’s founding principles to ensuring fair access for all patients, this article explores the potential pitfalls and how the government plans to overcome them. Additionally, we examine the impact of potential industrial action within the NHS and how it may affect the progress of the private sector involvement.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the NHS’s decision to embrace the private sector in its most significant expansion since the Blair era marks a crucial turning point in the UK’s healthcare landscape. By leveraging the resources and expertise of the independent sector, the NHS aims to tackle the pressing issue of record waiting lists and offer patients a wider choice of healthcare providers. While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead, the potential benefits of this partnership are immense and hold the promise of revolutionizing the healthcare ecosystem in the country.\nSummary:\n– The NHS’s expansion of private sector involvement is the most significant since the Blair era, with the aim of clearing record waiting lists and improving patient access to healthcare.\n– Community diagnostic centers (CDCs) run by the private sector will offer one-stop-shops for scans, tests, and checks, making healthcare more accessible and convenient for patients.\n– The government plans to utilize dashboards to capture and manage real-time data on spare capacity in both the NHS and the private sector, ensuring efficient resource allocation.\n– Patients will have a wider choice of healthcare providers, and those waiting for more than nine months can opt for a provider with shorter waiting times.\n– Collaboration between the NHS and the private sector is expected to create a win-win situation, with the NHS benefiting from increased capacity and faster diagnoses while the private sector gains business opportunities.\n– Challenges include preserving the NHS’s founding principles and ensuring fair access for all patients, as well as potential disruptions from industrial action within the NHS.\nAs the journey unfolds, it is crucial to closely monitor the progress of this transformation and assess its impact on patients, healthcare providers, and the overall quality of healthcare in the UK. This landmark shift promises to be one of innovation, collaboration, and, most importantly, improved patient care in the future.",

An owner of a Hyundai Kona EV has reported that after his vehicle received a routine software upgrade from the dealer, he discovered buried in the lengthy terms and conditions that it now had “geo-fencing and geo-timing capabilities” installed.\nWhat does this mean? Geo-fencing allows the ability to set geographic boundaries beyond which the vehicle cannot be driven. Geo-timing adds the ability to restrict the car’s use based on set time periods. Essentially, this software grants the vehicle manufacturer and potentially government authorities the ability to remotely control where and when you can operate your own vehicle.\nThe owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, was alarmed to find the update had been installed without his informed consent. When he raised objections, the dealer claimed to be unaware of these capabilities. Further inquiries revealed this geo-tracking tech is being rolled out across multiple car brands, all using the same platform software.\nThe sobering implication is that any modern vehicle could already have the necessary hardware to enable full autonomous control and monitoring, even if that functionality is currently dormant. As the owner notes, “I did lots of research including with some high-tech crash repairers who said some everyday cars are already fully autonomous, just not switched on.”\nWhile the purported justification is that such tracking would only be “required by law,” the potential for misuse is deeply concerning. One could envision scenarios like immobilizing vehicles during climate lockdowns, enforcing curfews, or restricting travel altogether under the guise of emissions reduction efforts.\nThe car owner’s advice?\n“Check the terms and conditions and see if they have it, and if not, suggest it to the dealer with notice not to install it. And if they do so, it means full refund of the car price. Get them to sign it.” With government overreach escalating, scrutinising anything that compromises your freedom of movement is prudent. Your vehicle could be the next privacy battleground.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_departures-and-dilemmas-unraveling-complexities-at-the-former-raf-base-asylum-camp/content_323.html": "Departures and Dilemmas: Unraveling Complexities at the Former RAF Base Asylum Camp\n**Introduction**\nIn a recent turn of events that exposes the intricate web of challenges in migrant reception and resettlement, a significant number of migrants have left an asylum camp situated at a former RAF base. The reasons behind their departure revolve around concerns of potential modern slavery and the prevailing living conditions within the camp. This unfolding situation sheds light on the complexities of asylum policies and the broader spectrum of challenges encountered by both migrants and the governing bodies responsible for their well-being.\n**The Backstory: Channel Migrants and RAF Wethersfield Camp**\nIn the preceding month, the UK Home Office orchestrated the relocation of 46 migrants, who had undertaken the perilous journey across the Channel, to an asylum camp established at RAF Wethersfield. This base, nestled near Braintree in Essex, was chosen as one of two disused RAF facilities that have been repurposed to function as the UK’s inaugural dedicated asylum camps. These camps emerged as a response to the influx of migrants arriving on small boats via the Channel.\n**Challenges Surface: Modern Slavery Concerns**\nThe narrative, however, took an unexpected turn as a notable number of migrants departed from the RAF Wethersfield camp. Out of the initial cohort of 46 migrants, a staggering sixteen individuals either found themselves relocated to hotels by the Home Office or made the personal choice to abandon the camp in favor of staying with relatives. A crucial factor propelling this exodus was the lurking threat of potential modern slavery. The Home Office’s guidelines dictated that those who fall within this category are “unsuitable” for accommodation within the camp.\n**Implications Unveiled: Legal Entanglements and Policy Reassessment**\nThe pivotal decision to evacuate potential victims of modern slavery from the camp holds profound implications, both for the individuals involved and for the broader landscape of immigration policy. Evidently, the Home Office exhibited an abundance of caution in light of possible legal ramifications should these vulnerable individuals continue to reside within the camp’s confines. This tactical move underscores the intricacies of managing legal obligations, ethical considerations, and pragmatic realities amidst the context of migrant reception and resettlement.\nFurthermore, this departure of a significant fraction of migrants from the RAF Wethersfield camp injects an additional layer of complexity into the government’s endeavor to transition migrants from transient accommodations in hotels to more expansive, specialized sites. This strategic shift forms part of a comprehensive scheme aimed at alleviating the financial strain on taxpayers, given the current staggering expenditure on asylum hotels, which reportedly accumulates to £6 million each day.\n**Future Outlook: Evolving Paradigms**\nAs the situation continues to unfurl, it invites contemplation about the viability and sustainability of housing diverse migrant populations within dedicated camps. The inherent tension between logistical considerations, legal requisites, and the well-being of the marginalized has moved into the forefront of the discourse. Additionally, the administrative challenges entailed in relocating migrants to larger sites, coupled with the legal battles enveloping these initiatives, underscore the multifaceted nature of the overarching issue.\n**Conclusion: Navigating the Complexities**\nIn summation, the departure of migrants from an asylum camp entrenched within a former RAF base underscores pertinent inquiries regarding the efficacy of such camps, the treatment of potential victims of modern slavery, and the overarching strategies concerning migrant reception and resettlement. This intricate interplay of legal frameworks, ethical quandaries, and the pragmatic intricacies of accommodating vulnerable populations necessitates an all-encompassing approach that fervently upholds the well-being and dignity of all migrants. As policies evolve, it remains patently clear that surmounting these multifarious challenges hinges upon persistent collaboration, unyielding empathy, and a steadfast commitment to safeguarding the rights of those in search of refuge.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_grooming-gangs-perpetrate-two-sexual-offences-a-day/content_1180.html": "Grooming Gangs Perpetrate Two Sexual Offences a day\nAnalysis of Police Data Across England and Wales Uncovers 572 Child ‘Grooming’ Crimes in Initial Nine Months of 2024\nNewly released police data has revealed that grooming gangs are responsible for nearly two child sexual abuse offences each day reported to authorities. This groundbreaking analysis represents the first comprehensive examination of such crimes across the nation.\nAccording to data collated from all 43 constabularies across England and Wales, law enforcement recorded 717 child sexual exploitation “grooming” crimes throughout 2023, with an additional 572 cases documented in the first three quarters of 2024.\nThese landmark statistics have emerged through the inaugural national police initiative to gather and scrutinise police-recorded “group-based” child sexual abuse, including detailed demographic information about perpetrators. The initiative, known as the “Hydrant Programme”, was established by police following criticism in Alexis Jay’s Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which highlighted the “widespread failure” to collect “good quality” data regarding abusers, victims, and the nature of offences.\nJay’s 2022 report emphasised that the absence of accurate data had fostered a “one-sided and often uninformed debate” regarding the ethnic backgrounds of perpetrators, whilst simultaneously hindering both the prosecution of offenders and the provision of support services for victims.\nThe issue has recently returned to the political spotlight following Labour’s decision to block an inquiry into the scandal. Sir Keir Starmer, who serves as Prime Minister, has faced particular scrutiny due to his former role as head of the Crown Prosecution Service during the height of the Oldham scandal in Greater Manchester. His party’s opposition to a national inquiry into grooming gangs has drawn significant criticism.\nThe comprehensive analysis reveals that “group-based” offending—defined as crimes involving two or more individuals—constituted 4,228 offences, representing 3.7 per cent of all 115,489 child sexual abuse and exploitation crimes, including those perpetrated online, throughout 2023.\nOf these 4,228 group-based offences, 17 per cent—equivalent to 717 cases—were classified as “grooming gang” incidents involving child sexual exploitation. Familial abuse cases, where two or more family members were involved in abusing children, accounted for 26 per cent of the group-based offences.\nInvestigators have also identified a significant proportion of “other” cases, which encompasses child sexual abuse committed by other children—a concerning trend that police believe has been exacerbated by the proliferation of pornography on the internet and young people’s increasingly online-centred lifestyles.\nRegarding the ethnic background of perpetrators, the majority—83 per cent—were identified as white, whilst 7 per cent were categorised as Asian, 5 per cent as black, and 3 per cent as mixed race. However, police officials have emphasised that these demographic breakdowns must be interpreted with caution, as they represent only 34 per cent of suspects, given that ethnicity can only be officially recorded following police interviews where individuals confirm their ethnic background.\nRichard Fewkes, who serves as director of the Hydrant Programme, indicated that the data suggests the profile of offenders broadly mirrors the overall ethnic composition of the UK population. In his discussion with The Telegraph, he stated: “In very general terms, what we see across all group-based offending is that no particular ethnicity stands out based on population data.”\nFewkes acknowledged that police forces had previously allowed “cultural sensitivities” to impede investigations but emphasised that this was “absolutely not” the current situation. He elaborated: “Our point is that wherever a child is at threat, wherever a child has been abused, that response should be robust right the way across the board, whoever’s committed it, whatever colour their skin, whatever religion they are, the policing response should be robust.”\nHistorically, law enforcement and prosecutors often hesitated to act against groomers, who have been predominantly of British-Pakistani origin, due to concerns about potential accusations of racism or Islamophobia. Sir Keir addressed this institutional failing in 2012 during his tenure as director of public prosecutions, stating: “In a number of cases presented to us, particularly in cases involving groups, there’s clearly an issue of ethnicity that has to be understood and addressed. As prosecutors we shouldn’t shy away from that.”\nHowever, Fewkes cautioned that the concentrated focus on “grooming gangs”—which represent a minority of offences even within group-based child sexual abuse—could adversely affect victims of other forms of abuse, potentially deterring them from coming forward. He explained: “We hear it directly from victims and survivors. Because if, let’s say, you are a victim of child sexual abuse within a family setting, which is our biggest threat, and you hear the narrative and the priority pushed by statutory agencies, and its focus is in one particular area, that has the impact of you thinking, ‘Well, I’m probably not going to be listened to because I’m not a priority.'”\nHe further warned that unbalanced media coverage was “triggering” for many victims, “because it is in essence bringing back to the fore their trauma from the abuse.”\nThe political response continues to evolve, with Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister, recently indicating openness to a specific inquiry on child grooming should victims desire one, stating that “nothing is off the table.” This development followed the revelation that Phillips had previously declined to support an inquiry into abuse in Oldham, which prompted Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative Party leader, to advocate for a national inquiry.\nThe parliamentary response culminated in MPs voting 364 to 111 against the demand for such an inquiry, leading to accusations from the Conservative Party that Sir Keir had committed an “act of cowardice” in opposing the investigation.\nThis comprehensive data collection and analysis represents a significant step forward in understanding and addressing the complex issue of group-based child sexual exploitation, whilst simultaneously highlighting the challenges faced by law enforcement and support services in addressing this critical safeguarding concern.",

The mayor recommitted to plans, published two years ago, last week. With less than a fortnight before the mayoral election on May 2, a fierce row has erupted on whether to introduce pay-per-mile charging.\nLast week, it was reported the Mayor’s official transport strategy continues to include a commitment to “investigate proposals for the next generation of road-user charging”, despite opportunities to update the document first published in 2018.\nThe mayor has been adamant “ruling out” introducing pay-per-mile charging but opponents say the mayor admitted the 2030 net zero target relies on road user charging. The mayor first proposed the 2030 goal – 20 years ahead of the Government’s 2050 target – in 2020, enshrining it in the 2021 re-election manifesto.\nThe latest manifesto states: “An ambitious target of making London a net zero-carbon city by 2030 – faster than any comparable city”.\nTo help the target, the mayor commissioned research by a sustainability consultancy, which in 2022 published a report on potential “pathways” to carbon neutrality. The report said “all scenarios would benefit from London-wide road user charging introduced as early as possible”, with charging “key early building blocks”.\nThe mayor picked an “accelerated green” pathway needing “London-wide road-user charging” from the “mid-late 2020s”.\nIn the formal response, the mayor said: “Reductions required – 27% cut in vehicle kilometres – is only possible with road user charging.”\nThe mayor went on: “Such a system could replace all existing charges with drivers paying per mile, based on pollution, congestion and public transport access.”\nOpponents also point out the mayor’s 2023 book says “plans to introduce a new, comprehensive, road user charging system”.\nAt a hustings, a Labour councillor said the book was “personal, not the manifesto” and “the mayor ruled out pay-per-mile for now”.\nThe opposition candidate said there was “no doubt he will put \\[pay-per-mile\\] in” based on “all the evidence”.\nBut a spokesman said: “The mayor has repeatedly and categorically ruled out pay-per-mile. It will not be introduced despite misleading statements.”\nConclusion\nThere is absolutely no doubt that Pay-Per-Mile is on their radar. Unfortunately, there was not enough resistance to ULEZ and I doubt that the conservatives will do anything to remove it, in fact, I would argue that they were complicit in its execution by their lack of opposition, there is no way the the Government of the United Kingdom could not have stopped the Mayor of London from doing something that was hated so much by the public. Therefore, I believe that they were happy to see Transport for London raise millions of pounds by extorting unjustified payments from motorists, because that would be money that the Government would not need to find.\nRoad pricing is being put into place behind the scenes and as always, they will blatantly lie about it, but once it is launched, it will be a slippery slope to dystopia. Control of who drives where and when, permission denied if you do not obey, or if you disagree with their sinister narrative, in fact any excuse for these power hungry, disturbed people to control the masses.",

By the first ad break, you may be wondering whether I’m breaching every equality law in the book. I’m not. I should know – I helped create those laws, and I used to enforce them. My name is Trevor Phillips. For ten years, I led Britain’s Equality Commissions. It was my job to ensure different racial and religious groups got on. Campaigners like me sincerely believed that if we could prevent people from expressing prejudiced ideas, they’d eventually stop thinking them. But now I’m convinced we were utterly wrong. In a world riven by racial and religious strife, some things are too important to leave unsaid, even if they might offend people. So in this film, I’m going to say some of the things we once told you were forbidden.\nAnd I know that in the next five minutes, some of you will be saying, “I don’t care what colour he is, he’s being totally racist.” This is Parliament Hill, one of the highest spots in North London. From my earliest days, I had a pretty good idea of who lived where around here. So if you look straight through there, that’s where we first settled when my parents came here in 1950, and they lived next to the Irish near Arsenal’s ground in Highbury. My mother’s best friend was Irish, Peggy. They sewed together in a sweatshop. Then, when we got a bit better off, we moved around here to Greenland, which is where the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots settled.\nAnd if you go a bit further around, you’ll see White Hart Lane, where Spurs have their ground in Tottenham. Every Saturday afternoon, of course, Spurs fans would come, a lot of them Jewish, to see the match. But the Jewish people didn’t live in Tottenham; that’s where we lived. They lived round there in that rather greener, nicer part in Highgate, in Hampstead, over there in Golders Green. So even at the age of seven or eight, I had a really good ethnic map of North London in my head. Of course, everybody who lives here knows all this, but as you grow up, you realise that polite people don’t talk about this kind of thing. But that’s exactly what I’m going to do.\nYes, it does say what you think it says, and I know nobody usually says that out loud. But is it true? Throughout recorded history, Jews have been vilified. Anti-Semites accused them of amassing great wealth and of sinister influence. This is the New West End Synagogue in Bayswater. This fabulous stained-glass window is just one of the treasures of this jewel of a synagogue in the heart of London. It cost a packet to build and obviously costs a lot to maintain it. But from the start, the congregation has been able to call on the wealth and the devotion of its most successful members, amongst them the most successful banking dynasty in history – the Rothschilds were the Jewish billionaires of their time.\nBut what of their modern-day successors? Out of Britain’s entire population, fewer than 1 in 200 of us is Jewish – that’s less than half of 1%. Today, there are just over 100 billionaires in the UK. Statistically, there should be hardly any Jews on the list. In fact, they make up 1/5 of Britain’s billionaires’ club. What all that tells us is that some Jews are very, very rich indeed. But maybe the billionaires are some kind of aberration. Not exactly – the net wealth of the average British household is just over £200,000, but the average British Jewish household turns out to be more than twice as wealthy.\nWhat about the powerful thing? Well, if this is the national seat of power, you’d expect to see just three or four Jewish MPs in the House of Commons. In fact, there are 22. There are, of course, other ways of measuring power. Take business – in comparison to the average, Jewish people are over three times as likely to be top managers in a FTSE 100 company. Or finance – Jews are four times as likely to be non-executive directors in banking. We know why speaking of Jews in this way makes most of us uneasy. Seventy years after the Nazis’ defeat, the long shadow of their crimes still makes even simple facts unsayable. And any talk that hints of Jewish superiority evokes just one set of images. The real point is this: we should envy other more successful groups, we shouldn’t fear them. After all, each of us is a creature of our own family background, our cultural inheritance, the neighbourhoods we grow up in. What we should actually be doing is learning from them.\nThe organisations I led worked hard to prevent people from perpetuating racial stereotypes, but we were swimming against the tide because many of them are largely true. Yes, Irish people do tend to dominate the building trade, and Greek Cypriots are more likely to run small businesses. And it really isn’t racist to observe that Indian women are eight times as likely to be your local chemist as the average person. The thing is, there’s no prejudice in numbers. I don’t think we should be put off talking about ethnic patterns of behaviour because of what bigots and racists might say. Of course, even positive stereotypes can make some people feel a bit uncomfortable, but things get really explosive when you ask who’s committing which crimes.\nMay 1997 – Tony Blair sweeps to power. Part of what was supposed to make New Labour really new was its enthusiastic embrace of multi-ethnic Britain. All the people shine through. When the Blair government asked me to lead the Commission for Racial Equality, both to them and me it seemed a crucial role, and I had, in some respects, had a lifetime’s preparation. I’m driving through the area where I grew up, doing something that millions of people do every day – it’s a kind of unofficial motoring offence called “driving while black”. I’ve managed it in a Citroen Dyane, a Mazda, a Volvo and even a Jaguar – some sort of social mobility record, I guess. Nothing wakes you up to your colour as sharply as being stopped and hearing the words “IC3” – which is cop talk for “black coming at you” – back through the police radio as they check that you haven’t stolen your own car. It’s the kind of thing that’s convinced people like me, black Britons, that if you’re going to be stopped by the police, they’re going to regard you as a potential criminal.\nBack in 1980, you didn’t see many black folk talking about this or anything else for that matter on TV. For that April, I had the chance to tell people who aren’t black exactly what it felt like. “Here we go, Mr Trevor Phillips is president of the National Union of Students. He’s the first black holder of that position. He’s 26 and was born in Britain of Guyanese parents. His great-grandmother was a slave in Barbados.” This is just 24 hours after black youths and police had fought a pitched battle in Bristol. “Yes, but if you have a search warrant hidden somewhere in your person, none of the people in the club had X-ray vision to know that they… I’m sorry.”\nIt all seems so simple back in the 80s. We saw the police as the bad guys, but in 2003, an Assistant Commissioner of the Met showed me new research that massively complicated the picture. Taric Ghaffur used to be the highest-ranking minority policeman in the country. A decade on and now out of the Met, he’s agreed to talk publicly about the data he had compiled. It was then, and is still, incendiary.\n(10:37) “If you take West London, which is Hounslow, areas around there, basically large South Asian, Somali kind of a network, we found violence, drugs, a lot of protection rackets. And then as you go to, as East London, you’ve got Newham, a very strong South Asian, Pakistani influence, a couple of very nasty murders up there. You get into Hackney, you got the Turkish influence with heroin. Then as you come down into the south, the Chinese factor, particularly human trafficking for sex trade purposes, you know, largely taking place in the middle. And of course, the very big Eastern European factor, you know, in central London where you know, Romanian pickpocketing gangs or, you know, ATM machine attacks there by these, from Europeans.”\n“There was another criminal network operating in South London that Taric’s unit had spotted. We go towards Stockwell. The widely held view a decade ago was that the African Caribbean drug gangs dominated crime in Lambeth. In fact, the serious crime in the area was run by Colombians. ‘We were building quite a strong surveillance, intelligence picture on large-scale cocaine importation into London from Colombia, a network that was worth up to about £200 million, and our teams were following some of these drug dealers. And believe me, not here, some of these guys were carrying up to £50,000 that they accumulated from drug deals right around an area that is sometimes a robbery hotspot, you know, street crime hotspot. So they were never touched.'”\n“It’s obviously really important to understand who is doing what so you target the right people, because actually, people think ‘Brixton, black crime’, yeah? But actually, the big crime here was absolutely… because if you generically go for people, then what you end up at doing is is upsetting the whole community, stigmatising a…am…stereotype. But intelligence-led policing is about using the data, building the evidence and then going in. And I can tell you now, no community would not give you a mandate for for that type of operation to take place.”\nMany equality campaigners worried about relying on ethnic crime data. They think it will be misused. But I think it’s minority communities who lose out, often terrorised and used as camouflage by criminals. “The top tier of criminality, organised criminality, were living in, in these particular flats. These guys are trending over hundreds of millions. They’re living on a council estate they are, because you know, it gives them relative safety.”\nBack then, none of this figured in the public debates about police community relations. What might look like racial profiling or preparing to stigmatise one ethnicity or another? “Unfortunately there has been, you know, over the years, great politicisation of policing. And to a certain extent, we seem to have created this totally unnecessary mantra that, you know, there are certain communities, if we do something that is going to impact, actually positively, on on safety and security, that becomes a racist or…the anxiety, I suppose, would be, ‘God, yeah, maybe you’ll get more criminals, but people might think we’re a bit racist.'”\nThe idea that different groups really do commit different crimes may sound like a racial slur, but it’s true. Let’s take pickpocketing in London. Here’s the number of arrests the Met made for that offence in 2012. Of those, over a third were from a single group – Romanians. Some people would say it’s dangerous to pick out Romanians in this way; experts call it racial profiling and worry that it encourages the police to discriminate. But would it still be racist if we could accurately say something similar about other ethnic groups?\nConsider black people in England and Wales – they’re over twice as likely to be sentenced for a violent crime than the average and over six times more likely to be sentenced for robbery. And white Britons? Well, alcohol-fuelled crime seems to be their speciality. None of these statistics tells us why they’re true, but they are. I don’t think we should be shy about trying to find out what they mean. But even some of my best friends would say that way lies madness.\nSimon Woolley is a longtime equality activist. Together we waged a successful campaign on stop and search. We made our breakthrough by crunching mountains of data to show that the police weren’t just discriminating, they were wasting time and money. Still, we don’t always see eye to eye. “Do you think it were wrong to use ethnicity data against criminals in the way that we used it against the cops?”\n“No, I’m not sure about that. Why would you say that? You have a black gang in London and you have a white gang in Glasgow, you wouldn’t…there’d be gangs, and they’d be involved in criminality, there’s no need to racially, racially code a gang if it’s a gang.”\n“But sometimes against our gangs because they are racially coded. There are crime families, there are organisations which are based on ethnicities. All sorts of groups shall have crime, so why, why would it be wrong? I think it’s to be able to talk publicly about that fact.”\n“No, but it’s not the dangerous when it gets too lazy and attach all description. Nobody wants to go down there, so if it’s nuanced then fine, but if it’s this headline, ‘You’ve got to do something about black gangs’, it’s dangerous, you know that and I know that. We can’t control the newspapers, but my point is, the longer we keep sort of soft-pedalling this and pretending that it’s not really true, you know, the more we keep sort of fuzzing these things, the harder it is to tackle, and the more these things become myths.”\n“Sure, yes your whole community. I mean, I don’t think there’s a, you’d have to, you have to fudge it. I don’t think you have to dodge it, you just have to be, you just have to be articulate about it and and if you are, you can talk about it, yeah, as it is without having this generic stuff going on.”\n“Trevor, it’s that’s what I worry about. We have a lazy media, we often have lazy politicians, and they will take what you say and too often, you’ve seen this time and time again, then we’ll use that to beat us with.”\n“But I would say that what you’re now doing is inviting me to self-edit according to the values set by the Daily Mail and The Sun. I’m just saying, we have to be mindful, yeah? But the point is, whatever you say, they’re gonna follow their line. Then don’t make it our problem, then is that we never talk about any of these things. We’re so afraid to say anything because we think it’ll be misused that we just shut up, and we never tackle…in these guys have to be smart, rather. But what does ‘smart’ mean?”\nSome would argue that the real factors behind these patterns are poverty, lack of education and discrimination in the justice system. But for me, that can’t be the whole picture. Some racial patterns aren’t explained away so easily.\nTake murder in England and Wales. If you’re white, you have a 9 in 1 million annual chance of being murdered. But if you’re black, that goes up to a 26 in 1 million chance – almost three times as likely. But of those black victims, most – three-quarters – are killed by black perpetrators. That’s an awkward fact for anyone who believes that the major cause of black disadvantage is discrimination by whites.\nLike many people faced with some inconvenient truths, I rather hoped that if I sat on them long enough, they’d go away by themselves. And maybe they would have done, but then something happened that forced me to face up to the realities.\nBy 2005, it felt as though we’d gone a long way to changing Britain. London’s pitch for the 2012 Olympic Games was based on the success of our drive to embrace diversity. When the verdict was announced, it felt as though the world had given us a stamp of approval. The New Labour vision of Britain as a multi-ethnic, multicultural beacon was at the heart of London’s victory. For us in the Equality Commissions, it wasn’t quite job done, but certainly a good day at the office.\n“Good morning. Good morning, we’re just trying to figure out exactly what this is. We’ve been told that there was something that happened.” And yet, less than 24 hours later, this happened – four bombers had struck London’s transport system, killing 52 people and injuring more than 700. Within hours, a grim-faced Prime Minister appealed for unity. “When they tried to divide our people or weaken our resolve, we will not be divided, and our resolve will hold firm.”\nBut when the country learned that those bombers were British Muslims, our unity was balanced on a knife-edge. Suddenly, I was being pressed to explain what this meant for community relations. Yet for nearly three months, other than joining in the appeal for calm, I elected to remain silent. The truth is, I was stunned by what had taken place here. After 9/11, most of us had expected some kind of terrorist attack on Britain, few expected this kind of violence to come from young men born and brought up in the UK, speaking in the accents of Yorkshire and London. This really wasn’t supposed to happen according to a version of events.\nSo what had we all missed? Over the following 10 weeks, we did some serious soul-searching and some detailed research. Our key conclusion – the ugly perversion of Islam that had led to this carnage would thrive only in isolated communities. By late September, I was ready to say my piece, but I already knew the message was one nobody really wanted to hear.\nSummary\n• Trevor Phillips was head of Britain’s Equality Commissions for 10 years, campaigning against racial prejudice\n• He now believes suppressing prejudiced views was the wrong approach\n• He advocates openly discussing racial differences and patterns of behavior\n• Notes disproportionate representation of certain ethnic groups:\n– Jewish wealth and overrepresentation amongst billionaires/business elite\n– Ethnic breakdowns of criminals by types of crime and location\n– Higher rates of violent crime sentencing for Black people\n• Claims data should guide unbiased intervention, not racial stereotyping\n• Recounts backlash for discussing Muslim sexual grooming gangs targeting white girls\n• Cites tension between celebrating diversity while ignoring negative patterns\n• Argues open discussion is needed to understand and address root causes\n• Believes resentment over stifled views contributed to rise of UKIP\n• Calls for using data responsibly to identify and support underperforming groups\n• Suggests fear of being called racist has prevented constructive dialogue\nComment\nTrevor Phillips was almost the chief architect of modern multiculturalism, positive discrimination and directly or indirectly a supporter of the race blame culture. After years of contributing to what has become ‘tribal Britain’ it was in many ways to his credit that he had the honesty to admit that this was the wrong way to deal with immigration.\nUnfortunately, the damage may be beyond repair, as this has laid the foundations for the impending sectarian social unrest that has already gripped our nation, and this is just the beginning.\nDoes this in any way make amends for the terrible damage that he and his cohort have done to our country? I say not, they unleashed a culture of contempt for our society, our culture and the white European race that has evolved in to open discrimination and a sense of entitlement that is without argument, ‘out of control’\nIf we are to address this, before our nation is lost, we are in need to strong leadership and difficult decisions, however any leadership that attempts to address this will be faced with a world of opposition from many different directions.\nThe ‘catch-all’ terms for shutting down any attempt to counter this madness are used freely and without due consideration, people fear for their jobs, their careers, the bank accounts, their very credibility in our increasingly dystopian society.\nIs the British public brave enough to vote for change? That remains to be seen, but as we have seen in the by-election in Rochdale, the protests in support of Hamas and Gaza, the anti-Semitism, the complaints the Britain is ‘too white’ are a clear indication that our entire nation is on the brink of sectarian social unrest, the like of which has never been seen in this country for centuries.\nThere is only one thing that matters now, and that is for the silent majority, those who have been silenced, to put their fear to one side and take the decision to be brave at the ballot box.\nIf we want change, we must vote for it.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-plain-truth-about-marriage-and-divorce/content_287.html": "When a marriage ends\nWhen two people are in love, all that seems to occupy their thoughts is the desire to share the rest of their lives together. This romantic notions often lead to the altar, and eventually to having children. Marriage is traditionally considered a bond bound in heaven, a contract between two people who commit to stay together …through thick and thin, through sickness and in health.\nHaving their own family becomes the next greatest blessing that may even be seen as more joyous than the actual wedding. As a family, they share life together, with all it joys, sorrows, and everything in between. The enjoyment of each other’s company becomes the hallmark of their family.\nBut due to unfortunate events, some marriages do not last forever. Some fairy tales do not end with happily ever after. It is a fact that many couples do have differences that later turn out to be irreconcilable. Rather than endlessly be stuck in marital discord, some feuding couples see separation, annulment, or divorce as the only solution to end their fractured relationship.\nNaturally, separation and divorce brings untold anxiety not only upon the marriage partners, but often, more so on the children. Having a divorce can be both unpredictable and scary, for completing this whole process means the destruction of the whole foundation of the family —not to mention the staggering costs of alimony and child support. Anxiety is present in divorce discussions, since the couple are not in good terms. A marital crisis is a family tragedy that would require years of emotional healing, if only to regain the self-esteem and stability of every person in the family.\nOne of the greatest difficulties when a relationship ends, is that in many cases, the feeling is not mutual, where that is the case, it makes everything far more civilised, but where it is not, one partner can and often does react quite badly. Nothing sums it up better than a quote from a famous movie…\nThere are two dilemmas that rattle the human skull: How do you hold on to someone who won’t stay? And how do you get rid of someone who won’t go?\nGavin D’Amato: War of the Rose\nPerhaps even more than the two involved in the marriage, the ones who need emotional healing the most are the children. Children are the least prepared to face serious emotional and psychological trauma. Parents with divorced parents are almost stricken with anxiety. The stress is often seen in their poor performance in school and melancholic behaviour at home. With low self-esteem, many teenagers from broken homes resort to drugs and join gangs to find a substitute home or family. In any case, emotional healing is crucial if children are to be prepared or rehabilitated from the emotional scars that were brought about by their parents’ failed marriage. While keeping the marriage partnership intact may be the ideal, sometimes the avenue of divorce is taken by couples to prevent their children from becoming collateral damage in a situation where parents are constantly fighting.\nWith the end of a marriage comes a waterfall of emotion, upheaval, new beginnings, sore endings, heightened feelings, angry words, resentment and the “what ifs”. But the strongest feeling? Devastation and crippling disappointment in one’self. Why had this happened to me? Why did I have to be different, cause a stir? Buck convention?\nCan I get a no fault divorce?\nUnfortunately, if you live in England or Wales a no fault divorce will not be possible as the jurisdiction does not operate a no fault divorce system at present.\nUnlike many other divorce jurisdictions around the world, England and Wales operates a fault based system, which means that there has to be a reason for the divorce to take place.\nThe only grounds for divorce with an element of no fault, is the ground of 2 years separation with consent.\nHowever this ground does mean that your spouse has to agree in writing with your divorce petition. If they do not agree, then the divorce cannot proceed any further.\nResearch highlighting a significant lack of truth in divorce petitions should be a ‘wake-up call’ to politicians to introduce a no-fault divorce system, family lawyers have said.\nA report published in 2017 by the Nuffield Foundation, Finding Fault? Divorce Law and Practice in England and Wales, says that divorce petitions ‘are best viewed as a narrative produced to secure a legal divorce. They are not – as a lay person might suppose they should be – an accurate reflection of why the marriage broke down and who was “to blame”‘. Only three in 10 respondents told the research that the reason cited in their fault-based divorce closely matched the reason for separating.\nThe report states: ‘What might be regarded as stretching of the truth in such cases is not confined to behaviour petitions. Adultery can be falsely claimed and admitted. Dates of separation may also be massaged to shorten wait times in two- and five-year separation cases.\n‘The manipulation of facts is now more routine and prosaic than the staged or bogus “hotel adulteries” with strangers of the 1930s, but it remains an issue.’\nResolution, a family justice organisation which has campaigned for no-fault divorce to be introduced, said the time has come ‘to make no-fault the default’.\nWhat are the legal grounds for divorce?\nCurrently in England and Wales spouses are unable to get a divorce without blame unless they have separated for at least two years.\nThere is one ground for divorce which is that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. To establish this ground, one of the following five facts must be proved:\n- Adultery\n- Unreasonable behaviour\n- Desertion\n- 2 years’ separation with consent\n- 5 years’ separation\nA study by YouGov on behalf of Resolution, a national organisation of family lawyers, confirmed that 27% of divorcing couples stated that they falsified claims of unreasonable behaviour in order to get a divorce.\nIn practice, unreasonable behaviour is often the only option available to spouses and the alternative is to wait at least two years before they can file a divorce petition and deal with their finances.\nGetting a divorce, dealing with your marital finances and with matters relating to children is extremely stressful and often acrimonious. This is clearly amplified by falsifying claims of unreasonable behaviour which will often result in a confrontational and un-cooperative attitude by the parties and may also have a knock on effect on the financial and children matters.\nThe Bill for no fault divorce\nA new Bill introducing the option of divorce without blame was debated in the House of Commons on 13thOctober 2015.\nMr Richard Bacon MP, in the motion to the House of Commons, made an important point that parties are being encouraged to avoid conflict and participate in mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution and it is completely contradictory to then provide for a system that forces couples to “throw mud at each other”.\nThe Bill essentially provides for a sixth fact where a divorce can be obtained by both spouses signing a declaration that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. However, a decree absolute ending their marriage would not be granted until a period of one year had elapsed giving the parties time to reflect on whether they really wanted a divorce.\nThe Bill applies equally to the dissolution of Civil Partnerships and will get a second reading on 4th December 2015.\nDoes the Bill go far enough?\nUnder the current Bill, the no fault divorce option will only be available if both parties agree to the divorce and sign the relevant declarations. However, there are likely to be a significant number of cases in which one party does not want a divorce for various reasons and refuses to sign the declaration. Therefore even if this Bill becomes law, there will still be a lot of petitions filed on the basis of unreasonable behaviour.\nFurthermore, the one year cooling off period will have the effect of deterring people from using the no fault option and they will continue to use unreasonable behaviour fact.\nNo fault divorce is available in several countries such as Australia, Canada, Sweden and United States of America and it seems that England and Wales are trailing far behind.\nThe effect of allegations of unreasonable behaviour on marital finances\nWhile the option of a no fault divorce is beneficial, it is important to note that allegations of unreasonable behaviour will very rarely impact the marital finances.\nIf a spouse files a divorce petition on the basis of the other spouse’s unreasonable behaviour, this does not necessarily mean that the other spouse will be entitled to less money from the matrimonial pot due to the alleged unreasonable behaviour.\nThe effect of these allegations is likely to be limited to the costs of the divorce.\nWhen dealing with marital finances, there are various factors which the court must consider. One of these factors is conduct which is serious and inequitable to disregard. This often relates to conduct where one party has dissipated the assets, for example by gambling away savings. The court has wide discretion and can deal with such conduct in many ways.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_saint-hilarion-castle/content_282.html": "The Saint Hilarion Castle lies on the Kyrenia mountain range, in Cyprus. This location provided the castle with command of the pass road from Kyrenia to Nicosia. It is the best preserved ruin of the three former strongholds in the Kyrenia mountains, the others being Kantara and Buffavento. The castle is not named after St. Hilarion, active in Palestine and Cyprus in the 4th century. It was named after an obscure saint, who is traditionally held to have fled to Cyprus after the Arab conquest of the Holy Land and retired to the hilltop on which the castle was built for hermitage. An English traveller reported the preservation of his relics in the 14th century. It has been proposed that a monastery built in his name preceded the castle, which was built around it. However, this view is not supported by any substantial evidence. Starting in the 11th century, the Byzantines began fortification.\nSaint Hilarion formed the defense of the island with the castles of Buffavento and Kantara against Arab pirates raiding the coast. Some sections were further upgraded under the Lusignan rule, who kings may have used it as a summer residence. During the rule of Lusignans, the castle was the focus of a four-year struggle between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Regent John d’ Ibelin for control of Cyprus. Much of the castle was dismantled by the Venetians in the 15th century to reduce the up-keeping cost of garrisons.\nThe castle has three divisions or wards. The lower and middle wards served economic purposes, while the upper ward housed the royal family. The lower ward had the stables and the living quarters for the men-at-arms. The Prince John tower sits on a cliff high above the lower castle. The upper ward was surrounded by a 1.4 metre-thick Byzantine wall, made of rough masonry. The entrance is through a pointed arch built by the Lusignans. This was protected by a semicircular tower to the east. Within the ward is a courtyard, with twin peaks being situated to either side of it. To the north-east is an extremely ruined kitchen. To the west are the royal apartments, dated by various sources to the 13th or 14th centuries.\nAlthough mostly ruined today, this was a structure in the northeast-southwest axis, with a length of 25 m and width of 6 m. It has a basement containing a cistern and two floors. The ground floor has a height of 7 m and a pointed barrel vault. The upper floor is known for its carved windows, one of which is dubbed the Queen’s Window. These are placed on the western wall, which has a scenic view of the northern coast of Cyprus, especially the plains of Lapithos.",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cypriot-history-byzantine-period/content_293.html": "Byzantine period\nAfter the division of the Roman Empire into an eastern half and a western half, Cyprus came under the rule of Byzantium. The cities of Cyprus were destroyed by two successive earthquakes in 332 and 342 AD and this marked the end of an era and at the same time the beginning of a new one, very much connected with modern life in Cyprus. Most of the cities were not rebuilt, save Salamis which was rebuilt on a smaller scale and renamed Constantia after the Roman Emperor Constantius II, son of Constantine the Great, residing in Constantinople. The new city was now the capital of the island. It was mainly Christian and due to this some alterations were made during the rebuilding. The palaestra was turned into a meeting place and many architectural elements were used to erect spacious churches decorated with murals, mosaics and coloured marbles.\nThe main event in Cyprus in this period was the spreading of the Christian faith. At that time, its bishop, while still subject to the Church, was made autocephalous by the First Council of Ephesus. People were engaged very much in matters of faith, especially fighting the effort of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch to put the Church of Cyprus under his control. They were finally successful in 488, when Archbishop Anthemius guided by a dream discovered the tomb of Barnabas with the saint’s body lying in a coffin and on his chest a copy of the Gospel of Matthew in Barnabas’ own writing. Having the relics with him, Anthemius dashed to Constantinople and presented them to Emperor Zeno. The latter was very much impressed and he not only confirmed the independence of the Church of Cyprus but he also gave to the Archbishop in perpetuity three privileges that are as much alive today as they were then, namely to carry a sceptre instead of a pastoral staff, to sign with red ink and to wear a purple cloak during services. By the beginning of the 7th century, the patriarch of Alexandria was John the Merciful from Amathus. Another important Cypriot of the time is the church writer Leontios of Neapolis.\nArab conquest and Arab-Byzantine condominium\nIn 649 AD the Arabs made the first attack on the island under the leadership of Muawiyah I. They conquered the capital Salamis – Constantia after a brief siege, but drafted a treaty with the local rulers. In the course of this expedition a relative of Muhammad, Umm-Haram, fell from her mule near the Salt Lake at Larnaca and was killed. She was buried at that spot and the Hala Sultan Tekke was built there in Ottoman times.[1] Under Abu’l-Awar, the Arabs returned in 650 and installed a garrison of 12,000 on part of the island, where they remained until 680.\nIn 688, the emperor Justinian II and the caliph Abd al-Malik reached an unprecedented agreement. The Arabs evacuated the island, and for the next 300 years, Cyprus was ruled jointly by both the Caliphate and the Byzantines as a condominium, despite the nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland. The collected taxes were divided among the Arabs and the emperor.[citation needed]\nUnder Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867–886) Byzantine troops recaptured Cyprus, which was established as a theme, but after seven years the island reverted to the previous status quo. Once again, in 911, the Cypriots helped a Byzantine fleet under admiral Himerios, and in retaliation the Arabs under Damian of Tarsus ravaged the island for four months and carried off many captives. The isolation of Cyprus from the rest of the Greek-speaking world assisted the formation of a separate Cypriot dialect. This period of Arab influence lasted until the 10th century.\nByzantine Reconquest\nIn the year 965 or slightly earlier, the Byzantines reconquered the island and installed theme. The general Niketas Chalkoutzes led the reconquest, of which no details are known, and was probably the first governor of Cyprus after that.[2]\nA rebellion by governor Theophilos Erotikos in 1042, and another in 1092 by Rhapsomates, failed as they were quickly subdued by imperial forces.\nIn 1185, the last Byzantine governor of Cyprus, Isaac Komnenos, from a minor line of the Komnenos imperial house, rose in rebellion and attempted to seize the throne. His attempted coup was unsuccessful, but Komnenos was able to retain control of the island. Byzantine actions against Komnenos failed because he enjoyed the support of William II of Sicily. The emperor had agreed with the sultan of Egypt to close Cypriot harbours to the Crusaders",

Despite initial protests from villagers who argued it was the “wrong place” and that “asylum seekers deserve better,” the scheme proceeded, with an initial group of 50 migrants being transported to the site.\nWhen the asylum seekers first arrived, the Home Office provided assurances about integration and behaviour management. Officials stated that newcomers would undergo an orientation process to understand “acceptable behaviour” and learn how to become good citizens while minimising their impact on the community.\nHowever, recent reports suggest a growing divide between these initial promises and the current reality. The Daily Express recently documented concerning incidents, including one where an asylum seeker allegedly broke free from medical supervision and attacked an elderly resident’s moving vehicle while his daughter was inside. Local residents have reported frequent disturbances, with one neighbour noting “a lot of fights” and regular visits from emergency services to the facility.\nAmong the most pressing concerns for locals is the regular presence of groups, sometimes numbering up to 20 individuals, walking along private country roads around Weathersfield. CCTV footage from local properties has captured these groups, leading some residents, particularly women, to express fear about leaving their homes. There have also been reports of public defecation in streets and fields, claims that have deeply troubled the local community.\nLocal business owners, including Jeff from Temple Street Food, express frustration at what they perceive as a lack of consultation or consideration for residents’ concerns. “It doesn’t matter if it worries us because we’re just the people that live here,” Jeff remarked, suggesting that authorities “don’t give a monkeys” about local sentiment.\nThe situation has created such tension that many villagers are now reluctant to speak publicly about their experiences, fearing potential repercussions. Those who do speak out describe incidents including attempted unauthorised entry into homes and vehicles.\nTransport inequality has emerged as another point of contention, with villagers noting the stark contrast between their limited public transport options and the regular bus services provided for asylum seekers. While locals struggle with poor bus connections, the facility residents receive frequent transport to and from the site at taxpayer expense.\nThe financial implications of the facility have also raised eyebrows. Initial projections suggested costs of £5 million, which later increased to £49 million annually, with recent reports indicating potential expenses could reach £100 million.\nEven the asylum seekers themselves have expressed dissatisfaction with their living conditions, having previously staged protests about cold accommodation and slow internet access.\nIn response to the situation, a Home Office spokesperson stated: “This government inherited an asylum system under unprecedented strain. We’re working hard to restore order to that system and reducing the use of taxpayers’ money on expensive asylum hotels. That inevitably has meant difficult choices have been made.”\nAs Thursday’s decision approaches, the case of Weathersfield highlights the broader challenges facing the UK’s asylum system and the impact of large-scale accommodation centres on small rural communities. The situation raises important questions about integration, community consultation, and the balance between humanitarian obligations and local concerns.",

The reasons why the ‘rule’ exist are unclear, and nobody can adequately explain the behaviour.\nIt is part of “the way things are done around here”.\nA group of scientists placed five monkeys in a cage, and in the middle, a ladder with bananas on top. Every time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists soaked the rest of the monkeys with cold water.\nAfter a while, every time a monkey would start up the ladder, the others would pull it down and beat it up. After a time, no monkey would dare try climbing the ladder, no matter how great the temptation. The scientists then decided to replace one of the monkeys. The first thing this new monkey did was start to climb the ladder. Immediately, the others pulled him down and beat him up.\nAfter several beatings, the new monkey learned never to go up the ladder, even though there was no evident reason not to, aside from the beatings. The second monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The first monkey participated in the beating of the second monkey. A third monkey was changed and the same was repeated. The fourth monkey was changed, resulting in the same, before the fifth was finally replaced as well.\nWhat was left was a group of five monkeys that – without ever having received a cold shower – continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder. If it was possible to ask the monkeys why they beat up on all those who attempted to climb the ladder, their most likely answer would be “I don’t know. It’s just how things are done around here.”\nDoes that sound at all familiar?\nWhat are the lessons here?\n- Learned Behaviour\n- Social Engineering\n- Cultural Marxism\n- Social Education\n- The Control of Free Thinking\nTaking this experiment at face value (and there are those who argue that it did not actually take place) there is no doubt that we as citizens of a controlled society are being subjected to this experiment on a daily basis. We live by unwritten rules, often termed as ‘ETIQUETTE’ but in reality, are we actually being subjected to subliminal control, designed to make us capitulate to the people behind the people?\nIs there basis in fact here to take the next step in the path to understanding and exposing social engineering and cultural Marxism? I believe that there is. In fact, many of the trivial laws and by-laws in modern society are designed to create ‘Blind Subservience’ this, I will NEVER accept.",

His death came less than an hour after a 15-year-old boy was also found fatally wounded in Ashburton Park, Croydon. Both received treatment from paramedics but died at the scene.\nThe two deaths mean that 2021 was the worst year for teenage homicides since records began.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-rise-of-reform-uk/content_150.html": "The Rise of Reform UK\nThe Party the Tories Fear – A New Political Force Shaking Up British Politics\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of British politics, a new force has emerged that is sending shockwaves through the Conservative Party. Reform UK, a small populist political party set up by the renowned Nigel Farage but led by the lesser-known businessman Richard Tice, has been making waves with its unexpectedly strong performances in recent by-elections.\nThe by-election results in Kingswood and Wellingborough, where Reform UK secured 10.4% and a remarkable 13.3% of the vote respectively, have caught the attention of the Tories. So much so, that Tice even met with the rebel Conservative MP Lee Anderson, who lost the whip, fueling speculation about potential defections.\nAn Unconventional Structure with Farage at the Helm\nWhat sets Reform UK apart from traditional political parties is its unconventional structure as a private limited company. This unique setup was born out of Farage’s frustrations with the internal power struggles and infighting that plagued his former party, UKIP.\nBy establishing Reform UK as a limited company with a share structure, Farage has ensured that he maintains a firm grip on the party’s direction. Out of the 15 shares issued, Farage holds a majority of eight, while Tice possesses five. This arrangement effectively grants Farage, as the honorary president, the power to make major decisions and even potentially return as the leader if he so desires.\nHowever, there are ongoing discussions within Reform UK about transitioning into a more democratized party after the next general election, aligning it with the structures of the Conservative Party and Labour.\nA Populist Manifesto Targeting Disaffected Tories\nReform UK’s recently unveiled “Contract with the People” serves as a de facto manifesto, promising sweeping changes that are sure to resonate with disaffected Conservative voters. At its core, the manifesto proposes a series of dramatic tax cuts, including raising the income tax thresholds to £20,000 for basic rate taxpayers and £70,000 for higher rate taxpayers. Additionally, it calls for slashing inheritance tax and corporation tax rates.\nOn the contentious issue of immigration, Reform UK’s stance is uncompromising. The party advocates withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights and implementing a blanket ban on the settlement of illegal migrants in the UK, with a commitment to returning all intercepted boats to France.\nTice’s pitch is clear: Reform UK represents the true conservative values that the Tory party has abandoned, appealing directly to those who feel disenfranchised by the current administration’s perceived shift towards more centrist policies.\nTargeting Tory Voters in UKIP Strongholds\nWhile Reform UK plans to field candidates in every constituency across Great Britain (excluding Northern Ireland), their strategy appears to be centered around targeting disaffected Conservative voters, particularly in areas where UKIP previously performed well.\nAnalysis by the think tank More in Common suggests that a staggering 59% of Reform UK’s support is coming from former Tory voters who backed the Conservatives in 2019. In contrast, only 5% of their support is derived from former Labour supporters.\nThis data highlights the party’s potential to capitalize on the dissatisfaction felt by a significant portion of the Conservative base, posing a direct threat to the Tories’ traditional strongholds.\nA Tory Identity Crisis: Shift Right or Alienate Moderates?\nThe rise of Reform UK has exacerbated the Conservative Party’s ongoing identity crisis, with divergent factions offering contrasting solutions to counter the populist threat.\nOn one side, right-wing Tory MPs are urging Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to shift the party’s policies further to the right on issues like immigration and tax cuts. Their reasoning is that by mirroring Reform UK’s stance, the Conservatives can win back disaffected voters and neutralize the populist challenge.\nHowever, a more moderate faction within the party fears that such a lurch to the right could alienate their traditional base of centrist and “One Nation” Conservative supporters, particularly in the Tory heartlands of the Shires, the South East, and the South West. There is a concern that by embracing Reform UK’s hardline policies, the Conservatives risk driving these moderate voters towards Labour or the Liberal Democrats, potentially jeopardizing their hold on historically safe seats.\nSunak’s apparent indecision and mixed messaging on key issues reflect the party’s internal struggle to find a coherent identity and response to the Reform UK phenomenon.\nThe Farage Factor: A Potential Game-Changer\nWhile Reform UK’s current performance has raised concerns within the Conservative ranks, pollsters suggest that the involvement of Nigel Farage as the party’s leader could amplify the threat to unprecedented levels.\nEstimates indicate that if Farage were to return from his self-imposed “honorary president” role and assume the leadership of Reform UK, the party’s vote share could soar to between 15% and 20% nationally.\nFarage’s mastery of political theater and his ability to capture the public imagination have been key factors in his previous successes with UKIP and the Brexit Party. His potential involvement with Reform UK adds an element of unpredictability and could further destabilize the Tories’ electoral prospects.\nEchoes of the Past, but with Higher Stakes\nWhile the rise of Reform UK shares similarities with the previous surge of UKIP, which also posed a threat to the Conservative Party’s electoral dominance, the current political landscape lends a greater sense of urgency to the Tory predicament.\nIn 2015, when UKIP was at its peak, David Cameron’s promise of an EU referendum had temporarily placated many Eurosceptic voters, providing the Conservatives with a reprieve. However, Rishi Sunak currently lacks a clear policy solution to address the concerns of Reform UK’s supporters, leaving the party vulnerable.\nFurthermore, the Conservative Party’s dismal polling numbers – trailing far behind Labour and potentially facing the loss of up to 150 seats in the next general election – amplify the stakes. A significant portion of the Tory vote appears to be leaking towards Reform UK, and there is no easy solution to stem the bleeding.\nThe prospect of the Conservative Party, historically the most dominant force in British politics, being reduced to a rump of 140 MPs or fewer in the aftermath of the next election is a real possibility. Such a scenario could trigger a fundamental realignment of the party, forcing it to adopt a more populist, Reform UK-style platform in a bid to regain relevance and electoral success.\nThe impact of Reform UK on the future direction of British politics is profound, with the potential to reshape the ideological landscape and redefine the meaning of conservatism in the UK.\nAs the next general election looms on the horizon, the rise of this populist force has injected an unprecedented level of uncertainty into the political discourse. The ability of the Conservative Party to navigate this challenge will not only determine its own fate but could also have far-reaching implications for the nation’s trajectory in the years to come.\nSummary\n• Reform UK is a new populist political party set up by Nigel Farage and led by Richard Tice\n• It has an unconventional structure as a private limited company, with Farage holding majority shares\n• Reform UK’s “Contract with the People” proposes sweeping tax cuts and hardline immigration policies\n• It is targeting disaffected Conservative voters, with 59% of its support coming from former Tories\n• Reform UK’s rise has caused an identity crisis in the Conservative Party\n• Some Tories want to shift right to win back voters, others fear alienating moderate supporters\n• If Farage became leader, Reform UK’s vote share could rise to 15-20%\n• Echoes UKIP’s rise, but Tories in weaker position trailing Labour\n• Potential for Tory wipeout and fundamental realignment as a populist party\n• Reform UK’s impact could reshape British politics and redefine conservatism\nReform UK has grown through the support and desperation of the British public, who are sick to death with the ‘terrible twins’ who have controlled British politics for decades.\nReform recently broke double-digit results and the trajectory is upwards, which has alarmed the Conservatives to such a degree, that they are increasingly directing their attention to Reform. Ultimately, this is the dawn of a new age, with new ideas and motivated people who are determined to make significant changes for the better.\nFor details of everything that Reform UK stands for read the Contract to the People.\nReform is the party to vote for, I really hope that the public understand this in time for the election.",

Low corporate tax, which was 10% before the economic crisis and 4% for foreign businesses before entry to the EU, was arguably the main incentive for foreign companies setting up in Cyprus. For companies making good profits, relocation costs could be covered from the first tax year’s additional profit earnings, which made the move a no-brainer.\nThe finance ministry floated the idea of raising corporate tax on Tuesday and within 24 hours representatives of the business community met at the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and unanimously rejected it. Not only this, but in a statement issued by all participants they demanded “an immediate end to any discussion regarding the particular issue and the express revocation of the ministry’s intention.”\nIt’s quite interesting how the ROC has had its arm twisted by the EU (no doubt instigated by certain other members with an agenda) to capitulate to actually cutting its own throat.\nPrior to joining the EU, Cyprus had an offshore tax rate of 4%, which encouraged companies from around the world to register here, putting Cyprus on course to become the Switzerland of the Med. However, following the money grabbing haircut and successive hikes in the rate of tax, that position has been slipping and will inevitably fall further, should the rate rise again.\nWhy should corporations avoid tax you may ask? Well, let’s take a look at Gibraltar, which has always been a tax haven:\nCorporate tax is just 10% and personal tax is low, with the tax rate on income over £700,000 falling to just 5%.\nIt seems to me, that this administration is making a grave error, rising tax rates are a sure way to put the economy on a downward spiral, as they gradually need to take more and more, from less and less contributors, as companies simply move elsewhere.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_rachel-reeves-making-britain-a-laughing-stock/content_913.html": "Rachel Reeves ‘making Britain a laughing stock’\nRachel Reeves Faces Mounting Criticism Over China Diplomatic Mission as £600m Investment Deal Draws Fierce Scrutiny and Labour Support Wanes\nIn a development that has sparked considerable controversy within British political circles, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has found herself at the centre of intense criticism following her diplomatic mission to China, with opponents lambasting the relatively modest £600 million investment secured during her Beijing negotiations.\nThe Conservative Party has launched a blistering attack on the Shadow Chancellor, suggesting she has “returned virtually empty-handed” from her journey to the Chinese capital, a diplomatic venture she steadfastly pursued despite growing disquiet regarding her broader economic strategies.\nThe timing of her overseas engagement has proven particularly contentious, as the British Government grapples with escalating borrowing costs, raising serious questions about Ms Reeves’ ability to maintain her proposed debt and expenditure objectives. Financial analysts suggest this fiscal predicament could necessitate either substantial tax increases or more stringent spending reductions when she presents her forthcoming fiscal statement at March’s conclusion.\nDespite mounting pressure to abandon her Chinese diplomatic mission and address the pressing matter of spiralling borrowing costs—which have drawn uncomfortable parallels with Britain’s 1976 financial crisis—Ms Reeves proceeded with her scheduled meetings. Her diplomatic schedule included high-level consultations with Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng and Vice-Premier He Lifeng, marking the first significant economic dialogue between British and Chinese officials since 2019.\nThe diplomatic relationship between London and Beijing had notably cooled during the previous Conservative administration, primarily due to international concerns regarding China’s actions in Xinjiang, its handling of Hong Kong, and its stance towards Taiwan. However, the Labour Party has evidently identified enhanced economic cooperation with Beijing as a potential catalyst for reinvigorating the British economy, a strategy that has drawn both interest and criticism from various quarters.\nWithin Labour’s own ranks, support for Ms Reeves’ position has reportedly “evaporated,” according to party insiders, as anxiety mounts regarding her approach to taxation and public spending. Nevertheless, during Saturday’s diplomatic engagements, the Shadow Chancellor characterised her visit as a “significant milestone” in Labour’s renewed engagement with China, highlighting agreements valued at £600 million to be realised over a five-year period.\nFollowing her discussions with Vice-Premier He, Ms Reeves emphasised the practical nature of the cooperation, stating: “The outcomes we have achieved today exemplify pragmatic collaboration in action. We have identified common ground across various sectors, including financial services, trade, investment, and environmental initiatives.” She further suggested that this renewed engagement with China “positions us to generate up to £1 billion in value for the British economy.”\nThe diplomatic achievements encompass arrangements concerning financial services, agricultural and food exports, and cultural exchange programmes, among other areas of cooperation. However, these outcomes have faced sharp criticism from various quarters.\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative Party leader, offered a particularly scathing assessment to The Sun newspaper: “We have become the subject of ridicule among Western nations. While European countries and the United States are adopting increasingly robust stances towards China, we risk becoming increasingly isolated in our approach.”\nConservative MP Gareth Davies, serving as Shadow Financial Secretary, delivered an equally damning verdict: “The Shadow Chancellor has undertaken an extensive journey across the globe, only to return with negligible concrete achievements.”\nThe scepticism extends beyond political circles, with a prominent City adviser suggesting to journalists: “There’s an unmistakable air of desperation surrounding these developments. The notion that £600 million spread across five years represents a significant achievement is rather bewildering.”\nBeyond the immediate controversy surrounding her Chinese diplomatic mission, Ms Reeves faces mounting internal pressure regarding her broader economic strategy. Her October Budget, which included various tax increases, has drawn consistent criticism from the business community, with many suggesting it has impeded economic growth rather than stimulated it.\nA Labour MP, speaking on condition of anonymity, shared their concerns with The Telegraph: “The Government’s economic strategy is fundamentally predicated on achieving growth. However, there is a palpable lack of confidence in this approach. Sustainable growth requires favourable energy prices, robust business confidence, and substantial infrastructure investment—yet her policies appear to work against these very prerequisites.”\nThe same source added: “Support for her position has diminished considerably—even her initial supporters are now expressing doubts about her approach.”\nAnother Labour parliamentarian offered an even more stark assessment: “This current trajectory appears unsustainable, whether considering the immediate future or the longer term. The entire narrative was constructed around delivering growth, but we are now confronting some rather uncomfortable realities.”\nSummary\nThe controversy surrounding Rachel Reeves’ diplomatic mission to China has highlighted several critical challenges facing both the Shadow Chancellor and the Labour Party’s economic strategy. Here are the key takeaways:\n* The £600 million investment deal secured over five years has been widely criticised as insufficient, with both Conservative opponents and City advisers suggesting it demonstrates a concerning lack of diplomatic leverage in Anglo-Chinese relations.\n* Internal Labour Party support for Reeves appears to be deteriorating significantly, with previously loyal supporters now expressing serious doubts about her economic strategy and approach to international trade relations.\n* The timing of the China visit has proved particularly problematic, coinciding with increasing government borrowing costs and growing concerns about the UK’s fiscal stability, drawing uncomfortable parallels with the 1976 debt crisis.\n* The diplomatic mission represents a marked shift in UK-China relations, being the first high-level economic meeting since 2019, though critics argue this realignment comes at a time when other Western nations are taking a more cautious approach to Beijing.\n* Reeves’ October Budget continues to cast a long shadow over her economic credibility, with business leaders and party colleagues suggesting her tax-hiking approach may be actively hindering rather than promoting growth.\n* The fundamental tension between Labour’s growth-focused economic narrative and the practical outcomes of Reeves’ policies appears to be creating increasing strain within the party, with some MPs suggesting the current approach is unsustainable.\nThis situation presents a significant challenge for Labour’s economic strategy going forward, particularly as they attempt to balance international trade relationships with domestic economic priorities and maintain party unity behind their chosen approach.",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_uk-jobs-market-crisis/content_136.html": "UK Jobs Market Crisis\nEconomy Under Pressure as Employment Numbers Fall\nThe UK employment market is facing its most significant downturn since the COVID-19 pandemic, with job losses now occurring at the fastest rate since 2020. Excluding the pandemic period, the current rate of job losses represents the most severe decline since the 2008 financial crisis. March alone saw 70,000 jobs vanish from payrolls—by far the largest single monthly drop in the past decade outside of the initial COVID months.\nConcerning Trends in Employment Data\nWhile the Office for National Statistics (ONS) downplays the severity by stating that “the number of payrolled employees broadly stayed the same compared with March 2024 at 30.3 million, a small fall of 0.2% or 70,000 employees,” a deeper analysis reveals three critical issues within the data.\nFirstly, job losses were already mounting before April, when significant tax increases took effect. This pre-emptive decline signals that businesses were already struggling before the new fiscal measures were implemented, suggesting a foundational weakness in the economy.\nSecondly, the actual rate of job losses is considerably higher than the headline figures suggest. The 70,000 jobs lost is more than double the previous highest figure in this dataset, excluding the exceptional period of 2020. But the real situation in the private sector is substantially worse when examined in detail.\nThirdly, simultaneous with rising job losses, job vacancies are rapidly diminishing. This creates a particularly challenging situation for those who lose their jobs, as finding new employment becomes increasingly difficult. The resulting longer periods of unemployment contribute to a self-reinforcing downward spiral: more people lose jobs, fewer can find new ones, and the total unemployment figure climbs ever faster.\nApril’s Double Whammy: Minimum Wage and National Insurance Increases\nFrom the beginning of April, UK businesses have been hit by two significant changes simultaneously: an increase in employers’ National Insurance contributions and a substantial rise in the minimum wage.\nThe minimum wage has increased by 7% overall, but the impact is even more pronounced for businesses employing young people. For workers aged 18-20, the minimum wage has risen by an extraordinary 16%, now reaching £10 per hour. For those under 18, the increase is even more dramatic at 18%, bringing their minimum wage to £7.55.\nThis disproportionately affects businesses that rely heavily on younger employees—particularly restaurants, bars, pubs, hotels, and the broader leisure industry. These sectors typically operate on thin margins and depend on younger staff to remain profitable.\nCompounding this challenge, employers’ National Insurance contributions have increased from 13.8% to 15%. While this might appear modest as a percentage change, the threshold at which this contribution becomes due has been reduced from £9,000 to £5,000, significantly expanding the tax base.\nFor a young person working a 35-hour week in the hospitality industry at the new minimum wage of £10 per hour (for 18-20 year-olds), their annual salary would be approximately £18,200—a 16% increase for the employer. The employer’s National Insurance contribution on this salary has more than doubled, rising from £918 per year to £1,980.\nThe combined effect means that the cost of hiring an 18-20 year-old on a 35-hour minimum wage job has increased by nearly 22% in April alone—an almost quarter increase in employment costs overnight.\nBusiness Rates: Another Blow to the Hospitality Sector\nAdding to these pressures, the hospitality industry has also seen a significant change in business rates relief. During the pandemic, restaurants and hotels initially received 100% relief from business rates. This was later reduced to 75%, allowing these businesses to pay just one quarter of their normal business rates until recently. Now, that discount has been further reduced from 75% to 40%.\nWhile this gradual return to normal taxation might seem reasonable given the time elapsed since the pandemic, the timing is particularly unfortunate as it coincides with the dramatic increase in employment costs. This combination is proving especially painful for pubs and leisure businesses across the country.\nThe impact is already visible in the data. Just before the budget announcement in October, there were 94,000 job vacancies in the accommodation and food services sector. By March, that number had fallen to 84,000—before the April increases had even taken effect. The situation is expected to deteriorate further as businesses process their first payrolls with the higher wages and face their first higher National Insurance payments to HMRC.\nA Closer Look at the Employment Data\nA detailed examination of the employment data reveals a stark contrast between different sectors of the economy. In March alone, the accommodation and food service sector lost 92,000 jobs—an extraordinary decline for a single month in just one industry. This represents nearly 1% of all staff in that sector, vanishing in a single month—and this occurred before the April cost increases even took effect.\nComparing private and public sectors reveals another concerning pattern. Most private business sectors are showing negative employment growth, typically around -0.4% in March. Meanwhile, government sectors such as education, the NHS, and public administration are either stable or showing positive growth.\nThis suggests that the real economy—the private businesses that generate wealth—is contracting significantly while government employment is masking the severity of the decline in the overall figures.\nCollapsing Job Vacancies\nThe number of job postings is also falling dramatically. There are now 781,000 job vacancies in the UK—the lowest figure in seven years, excluding the pandemic dip. This is significantly lower than vacancy levels in 2018 and 2019, despite population growth during this period.\nCompanies are both firing existing staff and choosing not to hire replacements—a particularly troubling combination for economic prospects.\nData from the UK government’s redundancy payment service adds to the concern. When large companies plan mass layoffs, they must submit an HR1 form to this service. Recent months have seen expected redundancies rise from around 20,000 to 29,000 in March—a sudden 50% increase. Even more worrying is that this data doesn’t capture the majority of job losses, as most redundancies aren’t planned in advance and many come from smaller companies not required to report.\nContradictory Economic Signals\nCuriously, while employment data paints a bleak picture, GDP reports suggest the economy is booming. According to the latest figures, GDP increased by 0.5% in February, representing a 1% growth since October. The data indicates that every sector of the UK economy is growing rapidly, including the accommodation and food services sector, which supposedly grew by 0.04% in the latest month—the same sector that is laying off staff at unprecedented rates.\nThis contradiction raises serious questions about the reliability of the economic data or its interpretation.\nThe Compressed Wage Spectrum\nAnother fundamental issue in the UK economy is the increasingly compressed wage spectrum. The median wage in the UK now stands at £670 per week (approximately £35,000 annually) before bonuses and perks. Meanwhile, the minimum wage now equates to about £25,400 for someone working 40 hours per week.\nThe gap between the minimum and median wage has shrunk to just 40%—a historically unprecedented compression. This means the majority of people in the UK have nearly identical incomes, as minimum wages have been pushed up at extraordinary rates (7% this year, often 10% or more in recent years) while average wages have remained relatively stagnant.\nThis compression creates several problems. While it might appear beneficial that lower-paid workers receive higher salaries, the cost of everything that involves low-wage labor also increases substantially. The cost of goods, services, pub visits, and weekly food shopping has risen dramatically compared to 10-20 years ago.\nParadoxically, despite earning nominally higher salaries, many workers find themselves worse off in real terms. Twenty-five years ago, someone with a basic job could generally afford to pay their bills without much concern and perhaps save for a modest European holiday. Today, that same person, despite earning a much higher nominal salary, often struggles to cover basic expenses.\nThe compressed wage structure also reduces incentives for career advancement. The financial reward for working harder, putting in extra hours, and sacrificing personal time to climb the career ladder has diminished significantly. After 15 years of dedication, a worker might become a manager but earn only marginally more than entry-level staff.\nYouth Unemployment Crisis\nPerhaps most concerning is the impact on youth employment. With minimum wages rising far above inflation and the rate at which other wages increase, employers have less incentive to hire inexperienced workers or take chances on young graduates when they can hire experienced personnel for only slightly more.\nThe unemployment rate data by age group clearly illustrates this problem. The unemployment rate for over-50s is historically low at around 1.5%. For the 25-49 age band, unemployment remains stable at 3.2%. However, for 18-24 year-olds, unemployment has jumped from approximately 10% to 13.3% in the latest data.\nEven more troubling, 22% of unemployed 18-24 year-olds have been out of work for over a year, and this proportion continues to increase. This represents a brewing crisis that appears to be receiving insufficient attention from both the government and media.\nThe Road Ahead\nThe combination of rapidly increasing employment costs, reduced business rate relief, compressed wage structures, and growing youth unemployment presents significant challenges for the UK economy. As businesses adjust to the April changes, further job losses seem inevitable, particularly in sectors like hospitality that operate on thin margins and rely heavily on younger workers.\nThe contradiction between falling employment and supposedly growing GDP raises questions about the true state of the economy. If the trends identified continue, the UK may face not just an employment crisis but broader economic challenges as businesses struggle to adapt to the new cost structure while maintaining profitability.\nWhat’s particularly concerning is that these issues are developing despite—or perhaps because of—policies ostensibly designed to help workers through higher minimum wages. The unintended consequences of these well-intentioned measures may be creating long-term structural problems in the labor market that will prove difficult to address without comprehensive economic reform.\nI’ve rewritten the transcript as a comprehensive article that maintains all the key economic points while removing timestamps and speaker references. The article analyzes the UK employment crisis in depth, covering:\n- The severity of current job losses compared to historical periods\n- The impact of minimum wage and National Insurance increases on businesses\n- The disproportionate effect on the hospitality sector\n- The contrast between private and public sector employment trends\n- The compression of the wage spectrum and its consequences\n- The growing youth unemployment crisis\n- The contradiction between employment data and GDP reports\nVery good https://is.gd/tpjNyL",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_ethnic-identity-in-cyprus/content_307.html": "Cyprus is an island nation in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. This is the third largest and most populous island in the region and located east of Greece. The island of Cyprus has been inhabited since the 10th millennium BC and has a population estimated at 1.20 million in 2019.\nCyprus has an estimated population of 1.20 million in 2019, up from the 2011 census of 839,000 and the 2011 estimate of 1.11 million. This ranks 158th in the world.\nOf the 1.16 million people in Cyprus, about 300,000 live in the north, although it’s believed this number has climbed to 500,000, half of whom are Turkish settlers or Cypriot-born children of settlers. There is only one city in Cyprus with a population over 100,000. Limassol has a population of 101,000, with a metro area population of 185,000. Nicosia, the capital, is divided into the North (pop 61,000) and the South (pop 55,000).\nCyprus itself is de facto partitioned into the south, which is effectively under control of the Republic and accounts for 59% of the island, and the north, administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The North is recognised only by Turkey. The international community considers the northern region as part of Cyprus which is occupied by Turkish forces.\nCyprus Demographics\nCyprus inhabitants are known as Cypriots. In 2001, the population was comprised of 77% Greek Cypriots, 18% Turkish and 5% other, with about 10,500 people of Russian origin in the nation. The Republic of Cyprus is also home to about 110,000 foreign permanent residents and between 10,000 and 30,000 undocumented illegal immigrants.\nThe Turkish Cypriots live in the north of the country. The villages of Pyla and Potamia are the only two in the Republic with a mixed population of Turkish and Greek residents.\nNearly every Greek Cypriot is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus. The majority of Turkish Cypriots adhere to Sunni Islam. Cyprus is considered one of the most religious countries of the European Union. 95% of the population is Christian Orthodox, 0.9% is Armenian or Maronite, 1.5% is Roman Catholic, 1.0% belongs to the Church of England and 0.6% is Muslim, with just 1.3% not stating or religion or choosing another denomination.\nThere is a large Greek and Turkish Cypriot diaspora in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Turkey, and Greece.\nCyprus Population Growth\nThe country is growing modestly, and by 2020, it’s estimated to reach 1.2 million people.\nEthnic Identity\nThe people of Cyprus identify themselves in may ways.\nGreek\nGreek Cypriot\nCypriot\nTurkish Cypriot\nTurkish\nArmenian\nMaronite\n……….and that does not include the large numbers of Russians, Romanians, British and people from many other countries who have settled in Cyprus over the last few decades.\nThank you Chris, this is exactly what I want, and much as I know you may think I am nuts, to even attempt the impossible, I will continue to do so, so humour me and allow me to respond to your excellent questions:\n- What unites the two Communities if they speak a different language, have a different religion, differing customs, different origins and look to a different “mother” country?\nThe greatest barrier with the ethnic diversity of Cyprus is as much in the minds of the people as it is within the Demographic breakdown of the Island, so for the first part, I will focus on the ROC and the diversity within that section of the island.\nIn total, the population of Cyprus is now reported to be 1.2 million, a rise of 400,000 in recent years. As I stated in my video, large numbers have moved here from all over Europe, Russia and beyond. The largest single groups have been British, followed by Russians, neither of which speak Greek, but with the exception of a few Cypriots who have learned to speak Russian, the common language once again is ENGLISH, is it not?\nMost Cypriots who were raised abroad, (such as myself) live in or come from English speaking countries and even though they may be able to communicate in Greek, ranging from very little to fluent, their preferred choice of communication is and always remains English.\nDoes this cause any problems? No it does not, English is the international language and while nobody is suggesting that other languages are abandoned, but it makes perfect sense to build on a language that nearly everyone would be happy to learn/improve and one that would provide common ground for all.\nWith regard to the ‘MOTHERLANDS’ once again, people are free to identify themselves as they wish, the notion of a Cypriot race is one that is very divisive, as many people will cling on to their institutional ‘MOTHERLANDS’ but that need not be an obstacle. The irony is that the number of children born here to one Cypriot and one foreign parent is very high, yet those children are STILL raised with the same ethnic mind-set. I would argue that a child with a Russian mother is just as much Russian, as they are Cypriot, so is it not the citizenship that they have been raised to identify with the issue, rather than their gene pool?\nNearly all races, or demographics are made up of a particular fusion of people, within Russia, there are many differences across the nation, depending on their historical Gene pool, within the UK, we can say that people of a certain appearance have a high Viking, Saxon or Celtic Gene, yet they identify as English, or Scottish or Welsh.\nTherefore, I fervently believe that the issues of ethnic diversity, or Gene pool or even language are not real obstacles, they are certainly not obstacles to the hundreds of thousands who have taken up residence here.\nWith regard to the rest of the island, I have no doubt, that if we make the effort to move forward with a clear and INCLUSIVE nation building policy, designed to create a national identity WITHOUTH threatening people’s individual feelings on their ethnicity, with an effort to exploit the ubiquity of the English language, there will be far less resistance to slowly ending the social division. As for the politics, I will leave that to the politicians, I have no interest in remaining on the political merry-go-round that does nothing but divide everyone.\n- You seem to be very approving of the fact that Cyprus is in the EU and yet you’re rabidly against it when it comes to the UK where the EU is apparently the Devil’s emissary on Earth? Two policies for two countries? How come?\nI referred to the EU as factor that has changed Cyprus beyond recognition, as it is doing to other parts of Europe. I think that you, along with most supporters of the EU, confuse my contempt for the EU with my general feeling about Europe as a whole. I love the Europe, despise the EU, always have, always will, that is my opinion and it will never change. I would have definitely preferred to have seen Cyprus remain an independent united island, with the status of a Tax haven and an international shipping flag of convenience, an offshore tax rate of 4% rather than the politically castrated South East sector of the infernal EU.\nNevertheless, we are where we are and the demographics have gone too far for us to change now, therefore we can only go forward, we cannot rewind. Therefore, despite my reservations about the EU, we need to accept that we only have two choices here….\nAn island divided in to two ethnic halves\nOr\nAn island united under one common national identity of Cypriots.\nI use the term national identity as that does not distinguish between ethnic groups. I for one was born and raised in the UK, but I am not Anglo Saxon, I am obviously racially Cypriot, but I am culturally English, and as you know, when I have my English head on, GOD HELP anyone who offends, I’ll have their guts for garters………………….Does that answer your questions? lol",

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-loss-of-queen-elizabeth-ii/content_1167.html": "The loss of Queen Elizabeth II\nOn the 8th of September 2022, the UK, the Commonwealth and the entire world, lost the longest serving monarch in history. The world has changed so much since Queen Elizabeth III came to the throne, when her father King George VI died on the 6th of February 1952. Queen Elizabeth presided over the dismantling of the British Empire, changing the world for ever.\nThe British commonwealth was formed by King George V on the 11th December 1931, when Britain and the Dominions agreed that they were all equal members of a community within the British Empire. They all owed allegiance to the British king or queen, but the United Kingdom did not rule over them. This community was called the British Commonwealth of Nations or just the Commonwealth.\nQueen Elizabeth was the epitome of a fair and equal family of nations that collectively formed the Commonwealth. The position of a British monarch is one of great importance, so much so, that no alternative would even come close. We can often take the continuity, the smooth transition of one head of state to another, but we must not forget that this tradition was founded in blood.\nThe monarchy was not always a neutral head of state, but rather an institution that dictated to the masses, until the English civil war,(1642-1651) when Oliver Cromwell led the ‘Parliamentarians’ (Roundheads) against the Royalists, (Cavaliers) ending with the beheading of Charles I on the 16th January 1649, when Cromwell became protector until his death, which was followed by his son Richard Cromwell, who accepted the ‘Declaration of Breda’ made by King Charles II on the 4th April 1660, where he issued a Royal pardon for all those who recognised him as the official king, it was also accepted that he had been king since the death of his father. Charles II returned from exile, entering London on the 29th May 1660 and was subsequently crowned on the 23rd April 1661.\nHow is this relevant to the modern monarchy?\nThe English civil war, was a bloody affair, that ripped our nation apart, but this resulted in a monarchy that accepted the power to rule of the democratically elected parliament, setting the political foundation for the monarchy we know and love.\nThere has been no other quintessential embodiment of this spirit, than during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. She was always neutral, always guided by her advisers, she was inclusive and never divisive. It would not be wrong to state, that during her reign of over 70 years, she never made a single error in the discharge of her duty, which is no mean feat!\nI must admit, that when I was younger, I was not a royalist, on the contrary, I strongly supported the notion of the UK becoming a republic, but over the years, as I have monitored the alternatives, I have come to believe, most fervently that no other political structure would even come close to the monarchy. The continuation, the impartiality, the unity that an impartial and devoted head of state brings our nation, because they are free from the theatre and virtue signalling of politics.\nNo other nation has a transition of power that is so consistent, professional and warranting the utmost respect. For those who still support a monarchy, I would say, that no matter how any other system were structured, it would still be political, it would still result in candidates tearing each other apart in a public manner, in there determination to claim the top spot, this would be far cry from the system we have in place today.\nDuring her reign, Queen Elizabeth worked tirelessly, ensuring that she was always the regal representation of the United Kingdom around the world. She travelled extensively, circumventing the globe many, many times. She was even able to discharge her duty in meeting Liz Truss, to request that she forms a new government, just two days before her death, she conducted her duty to the last.\nThe world is full of dark forces, who seek to destroy all that is good, monarchy, democracy and morality. We have all no-doubt heard many different vile accusations that have been made against the monarchy, but much of it is founded by malice and political agenda. Although may may feel aggrieved that the monarchy officially ‘own’ so many palaces, so much land and have so many ancient rights, but these assets are national assets, which remain under the protectorate of the monarchy as part of the state.\nWhat would really happen if there were any alternative?\nI have no doubt that many of our beloved palaces would end up being under the ownership of foreign investors, they would not be preserved for posterity, as they transition from national assets to personal and political trophies. There would not be any continuation, with a traditional process that captures the imagination of the entire world, we would simply be reduced to individuals with personal agenda, humiliating themselves and our nation on the world platform.\nOur nation retains a tradition that is the envy of the world, I have no doubt that nations who have removed their monarchy in the past, must look upon us with envy, we are so fortunate to be citizens of this great nation.\nAre they perfect?\nOf course not, is any human perfect? I have no doubt that they have more than a few secrets, but they are not in place to be scrutinised personally. Our monarchy represents our nation to the world and in that respect, Queen Elizabeth was exemplary.\nMay she rest in peace.",

In 2021, more children were born to unmarried couples than to those who were married. Half of all children grow up in separate households. We have the unhappiest teenagers in Europe.\nThis has a devastating impact. On average, children from broken homes suffer from more educational failure, unemployment, homelessness and poverty.

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_rent-to-migrant-scheme-taking-our-homes/content_560.html": "Rent to migrant scheme taking our homes\nThe Secret Landlord: Landlords Will Embrace Labour’s ‘Rent Homes to Migrants’ Scheme, but Britain Will Pay the Price\nThe ‘Easy Money’ Arrangement for Buy-to-Let Owners Will Only Exacerbate the Nation’s Housing Crisis\nI must confess, the concept of effortless income rather appeals to me. In a country where extracting maximum value from individuals has become standard practice, the prospect of straightforward earnings seems rather like a welcome reprieve.\nHence, upon learning about housing contractor Serco organising an event at a four-star hotel to enlist landlords for a five-year guaranteed rent programme—with all expenses and upkeep included—I found myself wondering: where might I register my interest?\nThe stipulation, of course: you would be providing accommodation for asylum seekers on behalf of the Home Office.\nYet is this truly a drawback when one can rely upon rent being remitted in full and punctually? Consider also that Serco asserts it will comprehensively manage the property.\nIndeed, I may present as an avaricious, exploitative landlord, but I am equally a business person with invoices and taxation to address, alongside properties requiring maintenance.\nAny homeowner will appreciate that tradespeople and materials come at considerable expense, so the notion of securing a contract spanning more than five years during which another company assumes responsibility for all maintenance and repair costs appears nothing short of providential.\nThe hotel gathering was subsequently cancelled following The Telegraph’s coverage of the story. I can only surmise that Serco had been overwhelmed by numerous landlords eagerly offering their properties, rendering the recruitment initiative superfluous.\nAn element of Serco’s proposition includes their commitment to cover utilities and council tax. At a time when these charges have reached unprecedented levels—comparable to a second mortgage—I remain unacquainted with any landlord who would not readily embrace such an offer.\nWhilst seeking the path of least resistance financially may not represent an admirable characteristic, I have grown weary of the arduous, disagreeable burden of being a landlord, not to mention the taxation I am obliged to remit. Thus, I shall welcome any form of relief at present, even if that entails housing asylum seekers.\nNevertheless, I recognise this arrangement is not beneficial for Britain’s overall welfare.\nConsecutive governments have already fostered a housing crisis with unparalleled rental prices being demanded for an ever-diminishing stock of available properties. Attempting to gain entry to the property market has invariably involved substantial financial commitment, but nowadays even securing tenancy necessitates an astronomical sum, an impeccably credentialed guarantor, and navigation through a complex series of requirements.\nMoreover, the circumstances continue to deteriorate. With the forthcoming Renters’ Rights Bill, increasing numbers of landlords are withdrawing from the market—yet with escalations in stamp duty and prevailing market pessimism, there are fewer and fewer new landlords emerging to fill the void.\nThe consequence is a constriction in the system. Perhaps it more closely resembles a vessel on the verge of overflowing.\nYou see, individuals persistently arrive in Britain and people invariably require accommodation. Labour’s pledged 1.5 million new dwellings have yet to materialise, and the deficiency is placing extraordinary pressure on our existing housing stock.\nFor those landlords who persist in the marketplace, the hazards associated with conducting business intensify daily. The judicial system is in disarray, and protracted proceedings to reclaim possession of a property—often exceeding twelve months—have become the norm. Furthermore, the expenses amount to thousands—tens of thousands, should the tenant cease to pay rent.\nThe entire predicament is thoroughly unsatisfactory.\nShould the Government harbour genuine intentions to address the housing crisis, it would be well-advised to acknowledge the necessity of collaboration with private landlords, rather than introducing yet further regulations that constrain them.\nThe provision of affordable housing constitutes the foundation for establishing a thriving economy. However, despite the assurances offered by politicians, we continue to face an estimated 1.3 million individuals on social housing waiting lists.\nIncorporating asylum seekers into this tally will merely compound the difficulties.\nThe current approach demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of market dynamics. Landlords, operating as commercial entities, will naturally gravitate towards arrangements offering stability and minimal complexity. The Serco proposition represents precisely this—guaranteed income without the customary uncertainties associated with traditional letting.\nYet whilst this arrangement might prove financially advantageous for individual property owners, it simultaneously reduces the available housing stock for domestic residents already confronting significant challenges in securing suitable accommodation. The resulting competition for remaining properties inevitably drives prices upward, creating a vicious cycle of inflated costs and diminished accessibility.\nFurthermore, this strategy potentially cultivates geographical concentrations of asylum seekers in areas where property values or rental yields might otherwise be less attractive to landlords, potentially hindering integration efforts and placing additional pressures on local services and infrastructure.\nThe economic implications extend beyond merely housing concerns. A functioning property market contributes substantially to workforce mobility, allowing individuals to relocate for employment opportunities. When housing becomes prohibitively expensive or simply unavailable, this mobility becomes constrained, potentially impacting productivity and economic growth throughout the country.\nWhat remains particularly frustrating is the absence of a comprehensive, long-term housing strategy that acknowledges the multifaceted nature of the crisis. Whilst discussions frequently centre on construction targets, insufficient attention is directed towards the retention of existing rental stock within the mainstream market.\nThe relationship between government and private landlords has deteriorated markedly in recent years, characterised by increasing regulatory burdens and diminishing financial incentives. This adversarial approach has proven counterproductive, driving many property owners to seek alternative investment vehicles or, as evidenced here, to pursue guaranteed income streams that potentially exacerbate broader societal challenges.\nA more nuanced approach would recognise private landlords as essential contributors to the housing ecosystem, providing necessary accommodation options whilst government initiatives focus on expanding social housing availability and addressing affordability concerns. Instead, current policies risk further constricting supply precisely when demand continues to intensify.\nThe Serco proposition merely represents a symptom of these broader systemic issues—a predictable market response to an environment where traditional letting has become increasingly fraught with complications and uncertainty. Until policymakers acknowledge and address these fundamental dynamics, we can anticipate further distortions within the housing market, with landlords understandably pursuing self-preservation whilst the broader societal implications remain unaddressed.\nUltimately, sustainable solutions must balance the legitimate concerns of property owners with the fundamental necessity of ensuring adequate, affordable housing for all residents. The current trajectory, however, suggests we remain distant from achieving this crucial equilibrium.\nComment\nAre you one of the millions of people who cannot even afford to rent, let alone buy a home?\nThe war on landlords (the wrong type) began in 2015, with the deregulation act, which caught a lot of landlords unaware who suddenly found themselves unable to use a sct 21 to recover their property.\nIn that year George Osborne also announce the stamp duty surcharge of 3% for anyone buying a property that was not their primary home, but here’s the insulting part, those able to buy six properties or more in one transaction were exempt!\nOver the past decade the war on private landlords has continued forcing many to sell up, and the slack is being taken up by the corporations and housing associations.\nNow we are seeing the consequences of their actions, less and less property for rent, resulting demand outstripping supply, which has pushed rents through the roof, at the expense of everyday people.\nNow this anti-British party are desperately appealing to landlords to rent their properties to SERCO, who are the main providers of rental homes for both asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. Considering that landlords have such a hard time renting in the traditional manner with an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) they are and will be tempted to rent to SERCO, reducing available rental stock for British people even further! At the same time, Jeremy Hunt all but scrapped the Capital Gains Tax allowance, further discouraging people from renovating the 670,000 empty homes in England alone!\nWas this all planned or just a very unlikely coincidence? Who knows!\nOne thing is for certain, if the masses do not stand against this very soon, there will be no homes for the British people, who are rapidly being pushed out in every sense of the word.",

Today, we delve into a topic that’s been stirring buzz across the tech landscape – the comeback of replaceable batteries. Join us as we uncover the impact of a groundbreaking law passed by the European Parliament that is set to reshape the world of consumer electronics.\nIn the early to mid-2010s, Android phones dominated the scene on Cold Fusion, showcasing a feature that’s now almost a distant memory – easily replaceable batteries. Carrying a spare battery was commonplace, but as time marched on, this convenient feature slipped into obscurity. Today, the industry standard is glass, glue, and metals, making replaceable batteries an increasingly distant memory. But change is afoot, my friends.\nThe European Parliament’s Sweeping Law\nThe stage is set with a sweeping new law from the European Parliament that’s poised to revolutionize the design of phones, tablets, and laptops. What does this law entail, you ask? Well, let’s dive right in.\nIn June 2023, the European Parliament made a resounding vote of 587 to 9, passing a law that compels all consumer devices to sport easily replaceable batteries. No special tools required – that’s the catch. Manufacturers are no longer allowed to employ adhesives in the battery replacement process. This means that the fundamental way phones have been designed for nearly a decade is about to be overhauled.\nImpact Across the Globe\nIt’s not just Europe that will experience this shift; the ripple effects are bound to reach every corner of the world. Phone manufacturers aren’t likely to produce region-specific phones, given the added costs involved. Think about giants like Apple, Google, and Samsung; they’ll all have to adapt.\nThe law isn’t just limited to phones – it extends its influence to tablets, laptops, electric vehicles (EVs), e-bikes, and any device equipped with a rechargeable battery. While the law is set to come into effect in 2027, it’s already causing waves and spurring discussions across the industry.\nChallenges Ahead\nThe law presents intriguing challenges. The prevalent glass sandwich design of smartphones is poised for a makeover. Adhesives will have to be phased out, and alternative methods need to be explored. Foldable phones, a recent innovation, face an especially tough road in meeting these requirements.\nSome voices argue that the law might lead to bulkier, less premium devices. However, this argument is countered by the example of LG G5, a phone that managed to be sleek, premium, and equipped with a replaceable battery.\nA Win for Right to Repair\nEmbedded within this shift is a victory for the “right to repair” movement, which champions easily repairable consumer goods. As devices become more complex, consumers often find it easier to buy new ones rather than repair. Apple, notorious for making third-party repairs difficult, is particularly in the spotlight. Their tactics of disabling features and warning users about non-genuine parts are raising eyebrows.\nGreen Motivations\nBehind this paradigm shift lies an eco-conscious motive. Over 50 million annual tons of electronic waste are generated when consumers opt for new devices instead of repairing old ones. The European Parliament aims to create a circular economy for batteries, minimizing waste and maximizing recyclability.\nThe Road Ahead\nIn conclusion, a new era is dawning in the world of consumer electronics. The European Parliament’s bold law is set to revolutionize how we view batteries, repairs, and the environment. While its implications are far-reaching, they all point towards a more sustainable and accessible future.\nAs we witness this transformation unfold over the next few years, one question remains: Were the changes in battery design driven by natural progressions in consumer demand, or were they motivated by profit, leading to anti-consumer products?

  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_the-dangers-of-autoerotic-asphyxiation/content_1039.html": "The dangers of Autoerotic Asphyxiation\nOne of the most dangerous sexual acts that you may have never heard of\nAutoerotic asphyxiation is an unusual but increasingly more frequently occurring phenomenon, with >1000 fatalities in the United States per year. Understanding of this manner of death is likewise increasing, as noted by the growing number of cases reported in the literature. However, this form of accidental death is much less frequently seen in females (male:female ratio >50:1), and there is correspondingly less literature on female victims of autoerotic asphyxiation. The authors present the case of a 31-year-old woman who died of an autoerotic ligature strangulation and review the current literature on the subject. The forensic examiner must be able to discern this syndrome from similar forms of accidental and suicidal death, and from homicidal hanging/strangulation.\nAutoerotic Asphyxiation. Is there a safe way to do that?\nNo. There is no doctor-approved way to strangle yourself while having sex or while masturbating. Indeed, cutting off oxygen to the brain is never a good idea. But there are ways to make this dangerous act slightly less dangerous: Do it with a trusted partner; set up a “safeword,” commonly used in bondage situations, to signal your partner to let you go; don’t use drugs or alcohol, which could make the strain that much riskier; and, of course, don’t tie the belt or rope too tight. Some deaths by asphyxiation occur simply because the victim made escape too difficult—in one case, a man rigged it so he would have needed a bolt cutter to release his chains. By definition these deaths are accidental and often result from failure of a ‘fail safe’ device that is designed to prevent lethal asphyxia. Other props may be more bizarre with evidence of cross-dressing, fetishism and sadomasochism. The death scene features usually enable differentiation from suicidal hanging, although suicide using this method has been documented in practitioners with depression.\nCOMMENT\nAutoerotic Asphyxiation is a dangerous act that is increasing at alarming rates. I first heard of it on a talk show thirty years ago, but at the time, it seemed to be so far removed from reality, that I never gave it another thought. However, this was at a pre-internet time, since access to sinister websites and hard porn has become widely available, many of these life-threatening acts have been on the increase, in ‘copy-cat’ behaviour.\nWhat is equally sinister and also rising at an alarming, is strangulation during sex. Strangulation – fatal and non-fatal – “squeezing”, “neck compression” or, as some call, it “breath-play” – is highly gendered. On average, one woman in the UK is strangled to death by her partner every two weeks!\nThe notion of experiencing a sense of euphoria at the point of passing out, is about as dangerous as it gets, with many women willing participating, whilst at the same time, this act can feed on the disturbed minds of many men, with tragic consequences. Sadly, this is yet another example of issues that are becoming increasingly detrimental to society, that may not gain much public attention individually, but collectively, they are one of the most tangible examples of moral crisis, since the dark ages.\nThere is a full article with real-life testimonies in this article in The Guardian",

I had absolutely no support with my child’s behaviour, yet I was the one who was made to feel the blame for her behaviour. When she got to 11, following the change to the two-tier system, I had to make a very difficult decision, should I have allowed her to go to a newly established secondary school, with almost 2,000 pupils, which would have been possible, given that she was officially borderline, or should I have sent her to a local ‘special needs’ school?\nI was totally convinced, having had issues with her already at primary school, where I was called in to explain, or apologise for something she had said or done many times, as though it were my fault, therefore, I knew that if she were to attend a mainstream secondary school, she would have been bullied, isolated and I would have had a very difficult time.\nFor her own safety, I decided to send her to a special needs school, the numbers were very small and I believed that they would be much more understanding. whilst the teachers most definitely had more time for her, the issues did not go away, they actually got worse.\nWhy did her behavioural issues deteriorate?\nAs this was a ‘special needs’ school, they had a bespoke manner in which they treated children, We need to keep in mind that some of the children had far worse conditions than my daughter, varying degrees of disability, both physical and psychological, therefore, the first priority of the school was to endeavour to give the children some semblance of normality.\nThere was a room in the school which was called the ‘angry room’ which was there for whenever the children were upset, so that they could go and be alone until they calmed down. However in this room, they had access to refreshments, including Tea. It did not take my daughter long to figure out that by simply by saying she was angry, she could leave the classroom, sit in the ‘angry room’ listen to her music on her mp3 player and drink Tea!\nAs always, I encountered incident after incident, with the head-teacher calling me to inform me, with a tone that indicated that I was somehow to blame, I often didn’t know what to say, what exactly was I supposed to do?\nOn one occasion, I received a call from the head-teacher, she said, “your daughter was playing football and she just kicked four boys, this is unacceptable” I replied, “what would you like me to do” to which I received a vague and unhelpful response.\nI had tried everything that I could think of, I scoured the internet for advice, after all, there is no ‘guide to successful parenting’ available. I then came across something called ‘tough love’ this was a process of denying children all but their absolute necessities, returning them one by one, as a reward for good behaviour.\nI then contacted the school and asked them to forbid my daughter form using her music player at school, as she was being punished for her terrible behaviour, to which I received the following response:\n“This school has a policy of ignoring bad behaviour and rewarding good behaviour, therefore we cannot do that!”\nHow was I supposed to react to that? I tried to emphasise that I had taken their concerns about her behaviour seriously and that I was doing all that I could to address this. I explained exactly what I was doing and that I was finding that at home, her behaviour had improved, as she naturally, wanted her possessions back. I was then contacted by the school and warned that my actions were contrary to my daughter’s ‘human rights’\nIn a thinly veiled threat, I was basically told that I would face consequences if I continued to punish my daughter in this manner. I took this on board and decided on another strategy to deal with this blatant school policy of ‘total responsibility yet no support’\nI waited for the next incident of bad behaviour from my daughter, when the head-teacher called, with the usual ‘I’m to blame’ tone, I responded as follows:\n“My daughter got up by herself today, took her medication, eat her breakfast and made her way to school in good time, I have adopted your policy of ignoring bad behaviour and rewarding good behaviour, therefore, as far as I am concerned, I have no issue with her, if she is misbehaving at school, I would urge you to reflect on your ability to manage her, which is not my responsibility”\nThis did not go down too well, I knew from her previous attitude of ‘passing the buck’ that I would encounter further issues, which I did. Several weeks later, after my daughter had basically won the battle of wits with her possessions, her behaviour became uncontrollable. On one occasion, when I was at the end of my tether, she swore at me, which I will not tolerate. so I smacked her and took her mobile.\nThe next day, I received a condescending, authoritative call from the head-teacher, demanding that I visit the school immediately, when I asked why, she responded, “I’m sure you know why”\nOn arriving at the school, I was received by a policeman, hardly in his twenties. I had to sit through an hour of lectures about smacking and I also had to show remorse, with the underlying threat that if I did not, I would be prosecuted. I responded exactly as required and that was the end of the matter.\nWhen my daughter got home, I told her what had happened and I explained that if the police had acted, she would have gone in to care, as there was nobody else to look after her. Her response was “I didn’t want that, I wanted them to teach you a lesson for taking my phone”\nIt was at this point that I realised that if I did not do something drastic, I would have not only suffered the sacrifice of trying to be a good parent, but I could face punishment for my efforts. Regardless of the attitude of the school, I had a great relationship with social services, they were very understanding and did all they could to help, even arranging the occasional day for respite, which is when your child can visit a children’s overnight unit, engage in activities, so that parents who were struggling like myself could have a day to recover. Unfortunately, my daughter’s condition was not deemed serious enough to be eligible, therefore, despite their best efforts, the respite ended.\nI explained my situation and forewarned them that I would need to deal with the attitude of the school, by ‘calling their bluff’ so that if my response were referred to them, they would be aware.\nWhen the next incident occurred at the school, I responded in a manner that took them totally by surprise. Following yet another cynical reprimand by the head teacher, I responded with:\n“I’m really sorry that you constantly express disappointment with my parenting, I can assure you that I have done nothing other than try my best, I work around my daughter, I have started an online business so that I can pay my way and still be available to look after her in person, yet I still do not seem to meet with your approval. There comes a time when we need to admit that we are out of our depth and for me personally, that time is now. I have kept records of everything that has happened, including details of all the occasions that you have called to apportion blame to myself. I feel that I now have no option but to admit that I am failing at this, therefore, I will be arranging to meet with social services to inform them of the situation. Heart-breaking as it may be, I must admit that I am failing at this and it may be time for them to make other arrangements for my daughter, for her own good. I will of course be mindful to credit you with your efforts to reprimand me for my failings and that I have finally decided to take your words on board and basically give up, I can’t see that I have any other option!”\nThis was the turning point, attitude adjustment is an understatement! The head-teacher changed her attitude immediately, she assured me that I would be provided with support, that they were fully aware that I was doing my best and that my personal sacrifices to raise a troubled child alone were not unnoticed.\nFrom that day forward, I never had another call from the school, for the remaining two years that my daughter attended. The next time that the social worker visited me, I updated her on exactly what I had done and why, she smiled and even though she could not commit herself one way or the other, she said, “you are an exemplary parent and you should be proud of what you are doing, under very demanding circumstances”\nHow does this relate to the exclusion or not as the case my be of children from schools?\nThis is totally relevant, how can parents discipline children if they have been left with no manner of doing so? Yes we all know that those who are able to, simply resort to bribery, purchasing their children’s co-operation with expensive gifts, the latest phones, branded clothing and such like. What does this actually achieve? Little more than raising a generation of ‘little princess/princesses’ who have no concept of the notion of value. The next generation of spoilt adults who don’t know what they want, but they want it now. We can see the effects of this up and down the country, but nobody dares to speak up about it, why would they?\nWhen a child is in their ‘terrible two’s’ as it’s called, they often resort to tantrums, these are little more than a war of wits, the first one to give in is an idiot. A responsible parent will never give in, but many do, just to make their life easier, but that sets a precedent for the rest of their lives. When they don’t get what they want, they resort to tantrums, vandalism or even violence.\nTeachers often suffer the brunt of this, which is not right. However, when we are in a society that to one degree or another exercises the very policy that my daughter’s school did, ‘ignoring bad behaviour and rewarding good behaviour’ the problem will only get worse. How can parents be responsible for children who misbehave, when they are powerless to respond?\nThis is not simply a case of ‘exclude or not to exclude’ this is a matter of social and environmental climate that has stifled discipline, domestic structure and respect from children, which is not good for them, for their parents, for teachers and for society.\n“Spare the rod and spoil the child”\nNever a truer word!\nThis sounds like a complete nightmare! I can’t imagine what it must have been like, but the parallel that you have drawn, between the lack of discipline in modern youth and the issues in the schools are spot on.",

Once again, they are trying to misdirect the British public with promises that income tax and national insurance will not rise, but there are so many other taxes that they could and would need to rely on to fill the massive hole in their budget.\nThe Conservatives have also struggled to balance the books, following the reckless distribution of billions of pounds through the lockdown, the horrendous cost of Net-Zero, which is at least £30bn a year and serves little more than to make the friends of those in power who provide anything remotely considered to be Green, very rich at the expense of hard working people, whilst nothing is done about issues that could be dealt with immediately, like banning plastic bottles, or taking steps to reduce trade with China, until it begins to reduce the smog that it is spewing out and chocking the entire planet.\nThere was no clearer indication that the Labour deception has been exposed, than the interview of one very angry Emily Thornberry, the unrelenting supporter of St. George’s flag………..not! When pushed on the Labour budget, it became clearly obvious that Sunak has inflicted serious damage to the Labour party, which they are struggling to deal with, it seems that the deception has been exposed.\nThe British public have been kept in the dark about the vast sums of taxpayer money that is being directed straight in to globalist pet projects and the pockets of those pulling the strings. As I previously said, net-zero costs the British taxpayer £30bn a year, resulting in many people struggling to keep warm due to the ridiculous green levies on their energy, despite the narrative, wind turbines do not run on wind, they run on subsidies, not to mention the thousands of acres of valuable farmland that is being lost for these things. Let’s not forget those who are making a fortune from these things, some of whom are very well-connected families, but I will leave that their, you can conduct your own research.\nThen there is the interest paid to private banks, by the Bank of England, for Quantitative Easing funds that were basically created out of thin air. Let’s put this blatant theft of public funds in to perspective, £35bn of public money, being VOLUNTARILY paid to private banks, real money taken from hard working people, given away to private banks as interest on money that doesn’t actually exist. Both parties tiptoe around these figures, because they are both more concerned about their globalist paymasters, than the British people.\nThere has also not been any mention of the unions, the core supporters of the Labour party, who have been quietly waiting for their payday, whilst the Conservatives are trying to invent policies to attract the very voters who they have alienated, but as we know from their past behaviour, they will say anything to get back into power, but should we fall for their lies, they will then proceed to arrogantly do exactly what they want.\nThese two parties have operated with trickery and deception in its worst form, they have continually played one side against the other, but in recent years, this has increasingly become little more than a blatant insult to the British people as they revel in their own arrogance, taking it for granted that they can do whatever they wish, and in the meantime, the people look to one or the other for salvation, but in reality, we have all been labouring under a misapprehension, placing our trust in the very people who intend to break it.\nThe most relevant example of the manner in which these people operate is Lambs looking to the farmer to protect them from the Wolves, but in the end, it is the farmer who will take the Lambs to the slaughter.\nNo matter what you do, I would urge you to get out there and cast your vote, I would be delighted if you would vote Reform, but in the end what really matters is Democracy, choose as you see fit, but I would say, vote these tyrants OUT!",
  "https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_/https_antonyantoniou_co_uk_cyprus-coup-detat-1974/content_356.html": "On this day, at 8.15AM, 15th of July, 1974, a military junta headed by Dimitrios Ioannidis, the hardliner Greek nationalist brigadier, shot Archbishop Makaris III/\nThe 1974 coup d’état in Cyprus was a military coup d’état by the Greek Army in Cyprus, the Cypriot National Guard and the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. On 15 July 1974 the coup plotters ousted President Makarios III and replaced him with pro-Enosis (Greek irridentist) nationalist Nikos Sampson as replaced president, only for 2 days. The Sampson regime was described as a puppet state, whose ultimate aim was the annexation of the island by Greece; in the short term, the coupists proclaimed the establishment of the “Hellenic Republic of Cyprus”. The coup was viewed as illegal by the United Nations and violated human rights laws.\nOn 3 May 1974, Makarios sent the Greek government a letter that identified certain Greek military officers stationed in Cyprus as undermining the Cypriot government.\nThe coup was ordered by Dimitrios Ioannidis, the shadow leader of the Greek junta, and Greek officers led the Cypriot National Guard to capture the Presidential Palace in Nicosia.[15] The building was almost entirely burned down.[16] Makarios narrowly escaped death in the attack. He fled the presidential palace from its back door and went to Paphos, where the British managed to retrieve him in the afternoon of 16 July and flew him from Akrotiri to Malta in a Royal Air Force Armstrong Whitworth Argosy transport and from there to London by a de Havilland Comet the next morning. On 19 July, he attended a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York and made a speech, in which he stated that Cyprus was invaded by Greece.\nAnother element working against Makarios was the fact that most officers of the Cypriot National Guard were Greek regulars who supported the junta\nThe newly established regime has been described as an extremist puppet regime of the Greek junta. On 15 July, between 8 am and 9 am, the coup leaders proclaimed their victory on the state channel Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, saying “The national guard intervened in order to solve the problematical situation. […]. Makarios is dead.” However, before his flight, Makarios announced that he was alive from a private broadcast in Paphos. The new government heavily censored the press and stopped left-wing newspapers being printed. Only right-wing newspapers Machi, Ethniki and Agon continued publishing, and their style was very propagandistic. Sampson did not openly announce his intention of enosis in the days following the coup, but instead focused on suppressing any support for Makarios and heavy propaganda to vilify his government.\nIn response, Rauf Denktaş, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Administration, stated that he believed that the events were among Greek Cypriots and called for Turkish Cypriots not to go out, as well as for UNFICYP to take extensive security measures for Turkish Cypriots. The Cypriot National Guard made no attempts to enter the Turkish Cypriot enclaves, but raided Greek and Turkish Cypriot homes alike in mixed villages to confiscate weapons. The Turkish government brought claims that ammunition was being carried to Cyprus by Olympic Air to the attention of UNFICYP. Whether the Turkish Cypriots suffered as a direct result of the coup remains controversial, but Sampson was seen as an untrustworthy figure due to his pro-enosis policies and “brutal” role against Turkish Cypriots in 1963.\nFollowing the coup, the newly established junta started a crackdown on Makarios supporters, resulting in a number of deaths and a “significant number”, according to Frank Hoffmeister, being detained. The number of deaths from the coup remains a disputed issue, as the Republic of Cyprus lists the deaths due to the coup among the missing due to the Turkish invasion. According to Haralambos Athanasopulos, at least 500 Greek Cypriots have been placed on the list of 1617 Greek Cypriot missing people and their deaths blamed on the Turks and Turkish Cypriots. According to Milliyet on 19 July 1974, violent clashes had broken out in Paphos, and even excluding Paphos, the death toll due to Greek Cypriot infighting was about 300 civilians and 30 Greek soldiers, whose bodies were brought to Athens.\nThis was the start of a chain of reactions that have left Cyprus divided ever since. There is NO DOUBT that the actions of this group was to blame, even though there were many factors that had led to the breakdown of relations between Cypriots in the past, even resulting in bloodshed, it was this single act, that gave Turkey the reason (or excuse) to invade Cyprus.\nHere we are, forty five years later and Cyprus is STILL divided, with every glimmer of hope, swiftly dashed by a pointless blame game…….NOBODY IS INNOCENT! It does not help that many of the instigators or supporters of EOKA B’ are either in government or at the very least, highly connected. How is Cyprus to move forward, if the actions of those to blame, from either side do not have the decency, the honour and the respect to admit what they did, accept the consequences of their actions and publicly condemn the politics that led to the division of Cyprus. We cannot re-write the past, but we cannot move forward unless we are all given the opportunity to hear the truth, to acknowledge it, accept it and confine it to the past. If the corridor that is the timeline of the last few decades, were to become a journey that all Cypriots could travel and close every door behind them, then maybe, just maybe, we could look to the future and move forward as a unified Cypriot nation.\nThis wass a day when the perpetrators of this tragedy led to a chain of events that would make the innocent people of Cyprus the true victims. The people who would ultimately be displaced, bereaved and divided.\nThe young – we must put our faith in the young Greek and Turkish Cypriots. I was born here in London during WW2. But my roots are in Karpasia [Komi Kebir, Koma Yalou, Trikomo]. The loss to me has been that, lacking access to the home my parents built for their retirement in the late 1960/ early 1970s, on the coast outside Trikomo, I have been unable to bring my children up knowing Cyprus as their ancestral home. At best, they have been tourists. I would have taken them there for the whole summer, every year – something I could not afford to do otherwise, on my salary as a lecturer.\nI visited the north, and our villages, including the house outside Trikomo, in 2009. I know there are various initiatives undertaken by ordinary people in Cyprus, both TC and GC. It would be good to know about these, and what can be done to help them in their efforts.\nThank you for your comment Andros, as I’m getting older, I am becoming increasingly passionate about seeing peace in Cyprus, genuine unilateral peace and not a mutual compromise that means everyone is not really satisfied. However, we have to start somewhere, and difficult as it may be for some, we can rebuild our island nation, or we can be destroyed by our mutual hostility……..I don’t know why everyone is looking to world leaders, it is in OUR hands.\nYes, I’m sure that’s right, what you say. It is in our hands. Except for a few extremists, most of us, TC or GC, get along fine. That has been my experience.\nThe young – we must put our faith in the young Greek and Turkish Cypriots.

It would be good to know about these, and what can be done to help them in their efforts.\nThank you for your comment Andros, as I’m getting older, I am becoming increasingly passionate about seeing peace in Cyprus, genuine unilateral peace and not a mutual compromise that means everyone is not really satisfied. However, we have to start somewhere, and difficult as it may be for some, we can rebuild our island nation, or we can be destroyed by our mutual hostility……..I don’t know why everyone is looking to world leaders, it is in OUR hands.\nYes, I’m sure that’s right, what you say. It is in our hands. Except for a few extremists, most of us, TC or GC, get along fine. That has been my experience.",
