  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_travellers-must-begin-to-learn-that-with-rights-come-responsibilities/content_1359.html": "Across the Country, our green and open spaces have been blighted this summer by the nuisance that is Unauthorised Traveller Encampments. It’s time to strengthen the law to stop these encampments appearing in the first place, toughen up the punishment for those that so flagrantly break the law, and ensure that Government and Local Authorities come together with the Police and the travelling community to find an approach that works for everyone.\nSadly, it feels as though Unauthorised Encampments are now part and parcel of summer life on so many of our open spaces. In their trail is a mass of mess and waste; garden, household, industrial, and even at times human waste. Too often this is coupled with an increase in crime and anti-social behaviour, and increased tension within our communities. This has been the case across the West Midlands repeatedly over the last few years but it is now becoming more widespread. In my Constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills it is common for these camps to consist of more than 50 Caravans and vehicles. Many of these are luxury caravans and cars that so many hard-working families can only dream of affording.\nNo longer is this the roaming workforce of yesteryear, travelling from town to town to find work and pay their way. These are large groups of travellers who arrive for months on end on an all encompassing tour. The right to lead a travelling lifestyle is an important one, and must be respected, but the travelling community whom are very fond of reminding us of those rights; must begin to learn that with rights come responsibilities. No single community should ever be above the law and the right to lead a travelling lifestyle should not equal the right to break the law.\nIn Parliament, we often talk of the importance of community cohesion, but so often when faced with the situation of Unauthorised Encampments we are focussing on the cohesion of the traveller community at the expense of the local settled population. Local Authorities do try and act, but most of the time their actions are not quick enough. Whilst this is not always the fault of the Local Authority the legal processes are sometimes too cumbersome and add to the heightened tensions in local communities as residents are left in a state of limbo.\nThe travelling community often understand the law and the hoops that councils must jump through before being able to move an encampment on. Each Encampment follows a similar pattern. Before being evicted by court order, the encampment simply moves to another site, where it sets up another camp whilst the council are forced to start the process again. Just before the council serve their order the encampment packs up and moves on only for the same process to repeat itself, often just a few yards down the road in the same borough. All too often it becomes a game of cat and mouse, which comes at great cost to all hard-pressed taxpayers, this has to come to an end, enough is enough.\nUnauthorised Encampments are a countrywide issue and we need to find a better approach to tackle these repeated incursions. It’s time for Local Councils to work closer with the police and develop a new strategy and I am hoping that by pressing for Parliamentary time to debate these issues this week that the Government consider whether changes in the law are needed to help swing the pendulum back towards the settled population of residents who are now at breaking point.\nThis Article was provided to the Express and Star and was first published on Friday 6 October 2017",

A large selection went on display in the Constituency office windows and in my office in Parliament for all to see.\nA huge thanks to everyone who has participated, and especially to our local schools and nurseries.\nMy weekend started with visits to Ryders Hayes School and Rushall Primary School to join in their Coronation Assemblies on Friday morning. It was a wonderful start to the Celebrations of the weekend.\nWith a big emphasis on communities, volunteering, and encouraging people to come together for the Coronation Celebrations it was a pleasure to then be able to join a very special ‘Thank You’ event organised by Jan Davies at Pelsall Village Centre, whilst enjoying a wonderful Sprinkles Tearoom afternoon tea!\nOn the eve of the Coronation, which is a deeply religious ceremony, St Michael and All Angels Church in Pelsall led an Ecumenical Vigil Service, together with Pelsall Methodist Church. For me this set the scene for the Coronation of King Charles III.\nAs the world watched as King Charles III was crowned at Westminster Abbey I joined Rev Nancy Ndoho and others at Aldridge Methodist Church to watch the Coronation Ceremony. It was a wonderful way to come together with the Nation for this truly historic and memorable occasion.\nMy Coronation weekend was then an action packed few days of attending community events, events with friends and family – My Coronation Memories.\nOn Saturday afternoon I was able to call in to the Friends of Streetly Library at the Streetly Library Fun Day, before heading to St Thomas Church in Aldridge, and then The Boathouse in Rushall, all of whom had organised Coronation activities, before ending the day lighting the Beacon in Aldridge.\nMany will remember how volunteers from Aldridge Shed, and Aldridge Rotary, together with support from local businesses and individuals created a Beacon to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee. The Aldridge Shed and Manor Farm Community Association Electronics Club then transformed the Beacon for the Coronation of HM King Charles III, and it now stands proudly back at the top of the High Street.\nJoined by Town Crier Stephen Green, Tim Bickley on the Trumpet, and members of 425 Aldridge Squadron RAF Cadets who provided the Guard of Honour, it was an honour to be invited to light the beacon once again.\nAs always, special thanks to all who supported the event and to those who were involved in the organisation including Rotary, North Aldridge Neighbourhood Watch, Street Watch, Russell Smith and Jewellery & Gifts Aldridge. And a big thank you to Aldridge Social Club too.\nSunday’s weather was very much on our side.

The day was rounded off with a cream tea at Christ the King Church, Rushall.\nWe are very fortunate to have many organisations and many volunteers who support our local communities in many ways, and on a personal level I was so pleased and honoured to be able to join in the Big Help Out as we continued our Coronation Celebrations. Thank You.\nMany of us have never seen a Coronation before. This weekend was truly historic and memorable. Each of us will have our own memories and reflections.

That means there will be £394 million a week additional resource in real terms supporting our precious NHS.\nThere will be a new focus on prevention, personal responsibility and promoting good health, and more rapid diagnostics and new treatments that will improve the care we all receive. From birth, through the challenges that life brings and into old age, the plan will ensure that the NHS will do much more to support people to stay healthy, rather than just treat them when ill.\nThe NHS plays a vital part in our lives, and we should never forget the extraordinary staff who are the everyday heroes providing support and care for us, day in, day out. The Long Term Plan for the NHS will help provide greater certainty to the staff and to all of us as patients of the National Health Service.\nLike you, my family and I have always relied on the NHS. I want to see us continue to preserve the value of fairness on which it was founded, whilst building the NHS of the future, ensuring it is there for generations to come, just as it has been in the past.

It will also be available to people who are on the shielded patient list and members of their household, all school year groups up to Year 7, pregnant women and those with pre-existing conditions. In total, more than 30 million people will be eligible to receive the flu jab.\nThe most at-risk groups will be offered the vaccine first, and once this is well underway, we will work with clinicians to decide when to open the programme to invite people aged 50 to 64.

Over the last few weeks I have been out and about across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and it has once again been a pleasure to see so many of you at your events.\nJust before Easter I was delighted to officially open the new Oaklands Lounge at Pelsall Community Centre. The Community Centre remains a valuable asset to Pelsall and the wider community and my congratulations go to the Committee for their hard work. The first meeting of the Rushall, Shelfield, Pelsall and Brownhills Neighbourhood Watch was held in mid-April and I was pleased to be able to attend. I was also grateful to the Chairman for inviting me to update the meeting about my opposition to the closure of Aldridge Police Station and other community safety issues as well as the consolation on Unauthorised Encampments. The Aldridge Spring Event organized by the Aldridge Village Partnership was another great success. There was once again a great array of community stalls, as well as homemade produce and crafts available. As so often is the case I was not able to resist another jar of homemade jam and marmalade. But a particular highlight for me during Easter Recess was Desert Island Discs – ‘Streetly style’ at All Saints Parish Church. In true Radio 4 style I picked my eight soundtracks, a book and a luxury item for my time as a ‘castaway’ and in interview with Streetly’s very own version of Kirsty Young in the form of Mike Garrett. I was put through my paces for 45-minutes as we strolled through my music and literary choices while discussing my career and role as your Member of Parliament. My thanks go to Rev’d Mandy Walker and All Saints Parish Church for inviting me to be their first castaway on their very own version of Desert Island Discs to mark the launch of the ‘Friends of All Saints Parish Church’. Rounding off April it was a great honour to officially reopen the George. E. Fullelove Memorial Shelter in Brownhills alongside the Fullelove Family and the community. The memorial shelter is a very important part of the local heritage of Brownhills and it is dedicated to commemorate George E. Fullelove’s lifetime of service to the local community particularly throughout the 1920’s, 30’s and 40’s. It was also an opportunity to congratulate and thank volunteers from the Brownhills Local Committee for all their hard work with Clean and Green to make this happen. |",

Whilst we are learning to live alongside the Covid-19 virus and we are benefiting from the development of treatments and vaccines we are still facing a very challenging Christmas.\nWe have continued throughout 2021 to see an outpouring of support for our local community by so many groups including our local Churches, Community Groups and local Council to help overcome the challenges which we have faced as a result of the pandemic.\nAs we enter the Christmas period we once again rededicate ourselves to thank our NHS staff, frontline workers and people who continue to work day in and day out to work on the frontline to beat this virus, we are indebted to them all.\nFor my part I remain extremely proud to be your Member of Parliament.

The work of individuals and organised groups who litter pick and tidy our local communities is to be commended and does not go unnoticed.\nI am therefore very pleased to see that as part of our wider Environment Plan the Government are backing community groups with additional funding to fight the war on litter. New funding has opened for community projects that tackle litter as we seek to make our communities greener, cleaner and tidier environments for all. This is the second round of funding, bringing available funds to over £300,000.\nThe funding builds on the Government’s wider Litter Strategy for England, as well as the recent launch of the 25 Year Environment Plan setting out how the Government will protect and enhance our natural environment.\nIt is only through government and communities working together that we will affect the long-term behavioural change that is needed to tackle this scourge, and leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it.\nKeeping the country’s streets clean cost local Government almost £700 million last year, much of which is avoidable litter, and money that could be better spent in the community.\nThe Government has recently announced a range of new measures to get tough on litter including almost doubling on-the-spot fines for litterers, and new penalties for littering from vehicles, making the keeper of the vehicle responsible even if it isn’t possible to identify precisely who threw the litter.\nThe Litter Innovation Fund is another step towards helping us tackle this blight and further details are below on how to apply.

This, combined with another freeze in fuel duty saving families more money at the pumps is to be welcomed.\nWith more people than ever using our excellent National Health Service it will receive an additional £2.8 billion of funding to 2019-20, including £350 million for this winter and £1.6 billion next year. There will also be additional funding for agreed nurses pay rises so that patient services are protected.\nThe Chancellor also listened to a call from myself and other West Midlands MP’s to increase budgets for Research, Development and Skills and to give our West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street more powers to help our region including Aldridge-Brownhills be more competitive and equipped for the new economic and technological challenges which lie ahead.\nSince the election in June we have remained focussed on ensuring that we create a Britain that works for everyone. Today’s Budget is another important step towards achieving that ambition for Britain and the residents of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.",

A typical police constable will see £760 a year more. The average soldier will get a £680 pay increase, plus a one-off payment of £300 this year. This has only been possible because of our balanced approach to the public finances. Getting debt falling, while investing in our vital services and keeping taxes low. We are backing businesses to help to grow our economy and pay the taxes which fund our public services. The Government is creating an economy that works for everyone and as we successfully pay down debt and wipe-out the deficit it means we can reward those faithful servants of the public service with a pay rise that they deserve. |",

Whilst accepting that this is a cautious opening up, the Government have backed the roadmap with guarantees of a further 6-months support through the furlough scheme, another two rounds of the self-employed support grants and a continuation of the £20 per week uplift in Universal Credit.\nThe Government’s immediate priority remains stabilising our economy as we emerge from lockdown, so there will be business grant support for non-essential retailers, the hospitality industry, and the leisure sector as they begin the process of reopening to their customers. There will continue to be a business rates holiday and the hospitality and tourism sector will continue to benefit from a reduced rate of VAT at 5% until the end of September and at 12.5% until the end of March 2022.\nAt its heart the budget placed an emphasis on supporting jobs, extending opportunity through improving skills and widening opportunity through new apprenticeships. By increasing work coaches, launching the Kick Start scheme and extending a lifetime skills guarantee as well as investing a further £126 million in Apprentice traineeships we are demonstrating that we will invest what it takes to keep Britain working.\nThe budget also reaffirms our commitment to hard working families with a further increase in the National Living Wage and for the eleventh year in a row another freeze in fuel duty saving families money at the pumps once again. Equally measures to increase funding to support victims of domestic violence and veterans suffering mental health issues will be welcomed across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.\nAs a Government we remain focussed on defeating the Covid-19 pandemic, rolling out the vaccine programme and ensuring that we deliver on your priorities.\nSuccessive budgets by this Government have always sought to balance the nation’s finances, support enterprise and level up access across the whole United Kingdom. This budget continues in that vein and I am sure that as we start the process of Building Back Better it will be a budget that delivers for all the hard-working families of Aldridge-Brownhills.",

Acting on the outcome of the EU Referendum we are ending free movement, taking back control of our borders and delivering on your priorities to reduce overall migration.\nOur new immigration system will take effect from 1 January 2021. As part of the new system we will assign points for specific skills, qualifications, salaries or professions with visas only awarded to those who gain enough points, ensuring we attract the brightest and best to our country.\nEnding free movement from the European Union means we will welcome people to work in the UK on the basis of their skills and qualifications, not their nationality. Our new single global system will treat EU and non-EU citizens equally, giving top priority to those with the highest skills and greatest talents, including scientists, engineers and academics.\nOur new immigration system will be truly global in its outlook it will help to boost the economy and communities, and unleash Britain’s full potential.",

This is welcome news and demonstrates her perseverance and achievement for Britain as we seek to deliver a ‘Truly Global Britain’ ahead of exiting the European Union in March 2019.\nSince Brexit negotiations started we made clear that there were three clear priorities which had to be achieved. A deal on the rights of UK nationals living abroad and EU Citizens living in the UK, ensuring that there would be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and a financial settlement which is fair to hard working families. All three of these priorities have now been achieved.\nThe next stage of our negotiations will be the development of a special partnership with the European Union which will allow us to trade freely, whilst ensuring that we leave the Single Market and the Customs Union as well as the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, honouring the outcome of the Referendum.\nThe Prime Minister’s steely determination has ensured that we will start 2018 with a renewed optimism to ensure that we will have a Brexit which works for Britain and which will work for all hard-working families across Britain. The outcome of phase one of the Brexit negotiations brings us closer to creating a ‘Truly Global Britain’ where we will begin to embrace the opportunities of the wider world with new friends and old allies alike.",

As we count down towards this and the Government honours the decision of June 23rd, we must do so constructively, encouraging the coming together of both sides of the debate. Above all let’s get on with this and work towards delivering the best deal for our country.\nMeanwhile there is much debate and news coverage of the NHS and in particular the challenges at this time of year. With a sister who works as a nurse I know just how hard our NHS and healthcare staff work, and not just in winter. As a country we face many challenges: an ageing population, an increasing population and, of course, the availability of many more new life saving treatments and options than ever before.\nAll these factors place challenges and pressures on the NHS, its staff and its resources, and the impact in particular of an ageing population has been discussed with me by some of our local GPs. Getting through the winter has to be a priority but alongside this is the need to develop effective and integrated health and social care. Money is an important factor, but we kid ourselves if we say that it is the only factor. It is also about making progress on safety, standards and quality and, above all continuing to value the NHS for all that it does.\nBack in the constituency I have held the first of my regular surgeries for 2017 in Aldridge and, like last year, I will be holding additional surgeries around the constituency in Brownhills, Pelsall and Streetly.\nHowever – I can’t end my column without a mention for Aldridge Youth Theatre and their fantastic production of Jack and the Beanstalk. There was no sign of first night nerves, just lots of pantomime fun and enthusiasm from a cast of colourful characters. From the very unique Dame Durden, to the adorable ‘Daisy’ the cow and of course Fairy Legume, you were all absolutely brilliant – well done!\nIf you haven’t been to see the show yet, it runs until next Friday, 27th January.",

It is not surprising therefore that there has been similar robust discussions taking place in Parliament.\nThe public however are now looking to us their elected politicians to resolve the political impasse that is engulfing our country. We had a Referendum in 2016 and this must be enacted. It is time to deliver Brexit, and deliver it by 31st October. Then get on with our other priorities such as the NHS, schools and tackling crime. Parliament is as polarised as the public in its views about the referendum, but I firmly believe that as Parliamentarians we have a responsibility for our language and our actions and need to moderate our tone accordingly.\nMany of our proceedings in Parliament may seem alien and bizarre to those outside of the “Westminster Bubble”, however they are governed by convention and through “Erskine May” our own Parliamentary Authority. Indeed although Erskine May first completed his work in the mid-19th Century it contains a key message which resonates as strongly today as when it was first published, and that is that “good temper and moderation should be the characteristics of parliamentary language”.\nFor over two-years Parliament has rejected every proposition that has been placed before it with regards to Brexit. Too often Parliament has been keen to tell the Government what it is that it doesn’t want, as opposed to positively saying what it does want. Indeed following the Supreme Court ruling and subsequent recall of Parliament last week the Prime Minister was questioned for over 3-hours and yet not one new idea or proposition was tabled by Parliamentary colleagues to break the Brexit log-jam.\nAs Prime Minister Boris Johnson was elected with a mandate to deliver Brexit and I am wholeheartedly supporting him to do so by 31st October. However, it is becoming increasingly clear to me that the only way to resolve the political situation and move our country forward is to hold a General Election.\nThis is why at the beginning of September I voted on two occasions with the Prime Minister for a General Election and I will do so again if the opportunity arises.\nIt’s time to delivery Brexit, unite our Country and move forward with a domestic agenda focussed on the issues that matter to my constituents.\nThis article was first published in the Royal Sutton Observer on 4th October 2019",

That means there will be £394 million a week additional resource in real terms supporting the NHS.\nLast week the Government also announced that a further £2.4 billion of taxpayers’ money will be saved and reinvested into NHS frontline services over the next five years, as costly and outdated models for purchasing goods and services is to be replaced.\nPlans are also underway preparing for winter this year. I am pleased that Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust has identified a scheme that can help with its patient flow and bed capacity, and has been allocated an additional £350,000 by the Government.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-column-3/content_1362.html": "It is 38 years since the Member of Parliament for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell, repeatedly asked the question how long English residents and MPs would tolerate a devolution settlement which left out England. This lead to what is known today as the “West Lothian Question”, and refers to whether MPs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales sitting in the House of Commons should be able to vote on matters that affect only England, while MPs from England are unable to vote on matters that have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.\nOne of the issues regularly raised with me on doorsteps across Aldridge-Brownhills during the General Election was that of English Votes for English Laws, and the message was loud and clear: people want to see a restoration of balance and fairness.\nAt a time when Scotland and Northern Ireland are gaining further powers it is only fair that English MPs are explicitly asked to agree to measures affecting England. The proposal we debated last week in Westminster was that legislation affecting only England should require the support of a majority of MPs representing English constituencies. In other words it was about delivering a manifesto promise of “English Votes for English Laws”.\nIt is about strengthening the Union whilst keeping a voice for all It delivers greater fairness and a coherent constitutional settlement in a way that is workable and practical. It was not about devolving powers to England, nor declassifying some MPs.\nLooking ahead, to next week, I will be presenting my Private Members Bill to the House of Commons for its Second reading. The Bill titled “NHS (Charitable Trusts) etc” will make a crucial difference to the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, and the work it does to support the Hospital, by securing the financially important Peter Pan Royalties that were bequeathed in perpetuity by JM Barrie to the Hospital. It will also remove Secretary of State powers to appoint trustees to NHS Charities. As with all Private Members Bills, its success or otherwise is in the gift of those MPs who are present on the day, but I remain optimistic and will continue to work hard to deliver this piece of legislation to the next stage of its passage through Parliament.\nNHS charities like many other organisations do so ‘much to support communities and individuals.\nIn recent weeks I have been fortunate to see at first hand some of the terrific work of the Royal British Legion in fundraising and raising awareness through events such as the Aldridge Poppy Run and the Pelsall Big Poppy Knit of the invaluable work they do.",

Changes in the line up of Government under the leadership of new Prime Minister Theresa May, have meant new Ministers, as well as new departments for International Trade and for Exiting the European Union. We also have the newly formed Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy where I am pleased to be have been appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary.\nLast week we heard the important announcement on education that included proposals to lift the ban on new Grammar Schools that was introduced back in 1998. There has already been much debate, and I am sure there will be more to come. However, let us be quite clear this not about a return to secondary moderns, it is about supporting the expansion of existing grammars, supporting a more diverse school system and helping to attract pupils from different backgrounds.\nThe Government has a strong record of school reform with 1.4million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010 and indeed we are very fortunate in this constituency that all our excellent secondary schools have been awarded either Good or Outstanding ratings from Ofsted. But, we must do more, and that is what these proposals are about, so that every child can have a good school place, and so that more families and children have the benefit of greater choice and opportunity. Whether we are looking at maintained schools, free schools, grammar, or academies it is right to keep our focus on raising standards and opportunities for everyone.\nI am pleased to learn that the Pupil Premium will remain for the poorest children and this makes a real difference in many of our schools. It is important to recognize and remember that there are many children from ordinary working class families who are being let down by the current lack of available good places and these proposals go the heart of dealing with this matter.\nOn other fronts last week we heard the initial findings from the Boundary commission, which will bring changes in the West Midlands. Under these proposals my current Aldridge-Brownhills constituency will remain as it is with the addition of two extra wards. . This was looked at during the last Parliament and it is a matter which needs to be resolved to address the current inequality of constituencies and to balance the democratic deficit that exists at Westminster.\nRounding off the week it was a pleasure to be able return from Parliament and attend the Presentation of Awards at Aldridge School, recognising the achievement and hardwork of students.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-mayoral-pledge-for-aldridge-brownhills/content_1620.html": "Families across the West Midlands will be pleased to know that West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has committed to not increasing the Mayoral precept if re-elected in May.\nSince Andy was elected in 2017 he has not added one penny to our Council Tax bills, but he has managed to lever significant investment right across the West Midlands, including here in Aldridge-Brownhills with the commitment to a train station in Aldridge and resources to help protect our Green Belt.\nWith family budgets under pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic this will be welcome news for my constituents.",
  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_its-national-apprenticeship-week/content_1567.html": "Events are taking place this week across England to celebrate the success of apprenticeships and to encourage even more people to choose an apprenticeship as a pathway to a great career.\nThis year’s theme for National Apprenticeship Week is ‘build the future’; reflecting on how apprenticeships can help individuals to develop the skills and knowledge required for a rewarding career, and businesses to develop a talented workforce that is equipped with future-ready skills.\nI have always been a big supporter of Apprenticeships and the role they play in bridging the skills gap and there is nothing like hearing from young people about their experiences and their achievements. Here in my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency, we are fortunate to have InComm Training and Business Services where I have met with employers and apprentices.\nI congratulate our local employers who are willing to invest time and money into apprentices as the skills gap would be a lot wider without their continued investment.",
  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-christmas-message/content_155.html": "The decorations are up, the Christmas tree sparkles, and final preparations are underway for the arrival of friends and family.\nChristmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Christ, enjoy the festivities of the season and spend time with those we love. It is also a time to pause for a moment and reflect: to remember those who are elderly, unwell or alone at Christmas, and those less fortunate than ourselves: to acknowledge the service and dedication of our Armed Forces and the brave work of the men and women who work tirelessly to keep us safe and secure. Those who work around the clock, including Christmas Day and New Year to provide life-saving healthcare, policing, fire and rescue, and emergency services for us all.\nAs 2016 draws towards a close I can’t help but think back over the events of the last 12 months. I am sure it will be remembered in history and analysed for generations to come. The Referendum in June delivered a clear message to leave the EU and our new Prime Minister, Theresa May, has quite rightly made it clear that Brexit means Brexit, and we must now get on with the job of delivering on that for our country. Beyond the shores of the UK we have seen the election of Donald Trump as the next President of the USA, a surprise to many, but a democratic decision nonetheless and one to be respected as we forge a new relationship with America and the rest of the world post-Brexit, building a Britain for everyone.\nMeanwhile, as the Member of Parliament for Aldridge, Brownhills, Pelsall, Rushall-Shelfield, Walsall Wood and Streetly, I will continue to do all I can to help constituents and lend my support to local groups and campaigns for the benefit of our local community. I feel privileged to have met with many more of you over the last year, as well as many of the inspirational groups, organisations, and charities we have locally. And, of course, not forgetting our excellent local schools. There are too many to mention here, so I pay tribute to you all for the tremendous work you do, often quietly and unassuming, but benefitting so many in our community in so many ways\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy and Peaceful New Year.",

It is hoped that the work will be completed by 23rd May.\nWinterley Lane has for a long time been a hotspot for fly tipping and I have continued to work with Councillors Rattigan and Waters to undertake regular litter picks in this area.\nI am pleased that Walsall Council are investing in Winterley Lane and I look forward to further investment being rolled out across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency throughout the year.",

By recognising this today it gives us all an opportunity to raise awareness of the scale of suicide around the world and acknowledge the sad reality that every 40 seconds someone loses their life to suicide.\nToday we can all take the opportunity to improve the awareness of the significance of suicide as a global public health problem, as well as our knowledge of what steps can be taken to prevent suicide. Today is also an opportunity to show people that we all care.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_whats-been-happening-in-westminster-3/content_767.html": "This week Parliament is in recess for the Whitsun Bank Holiday so I thought it was a good opportunity to bring residents from across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency up to date on some of the recent work in Parliament.\nThe Government remain focused on domestic matters and getting on with the day job of building a country that works for everyone, and for this months update I have included jobs and housing.\nThe latest round of economic figures showed that employment is now at a record high, unemployment at a 40-year low, and the number of young people out of work is down by nearly half a million. Wages are now rising faster than prices which is good news and growth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets. This is a turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy that works for everyone.\nSome of us will remember taking that big step of buying our first home. I certainly do. The decision therefore to cut stamp duty for 95% of first-time buyers is something I welcome, and it has started to help a new generation of homeowners with the number of first-time buyers at its highest since 2007. In addition to this however, we are also ensuring that we build the homes that people need and that housing in the rented sector is also affordable.\nThe Tenant Fees Bill also continued its passage through Parliament. This legislation will ensure that tenants are only required to pay their rent and deposit when securing a property in the private rented sector, it will abolish most upfront fees and it also caps security deposits at the equivalent of six weeks’ rent. This is another way to tackle housing affordability for everyone.\nOn a slightly different theme, but a topic which many of you have corresponded with me upon, I am pleased to see that the Government have now introduced a Bill to ban ivory sales, as part of our commitment to strengthen protections for animal welfare. The new legislation will mean that the United Kingdom ban will be one of the toughest in the world and will cover ivory items of all ages that directly or indirectly fuel elephant poaching demonstrating our global leadership on animal welfare.\nWhen Parliament resumes I am sure it promises to be a busy time.",

It will also establish a new Domestic Abuse Commissioner to be a voice for victims.\nDuring my time as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice I was pleased to be able to work on the Domestic Abuse Bill, a landmark piece of legislation that will help to end the suffering of more than 2 million adults across our country.",

The world of retail is changing and we need to look at the future of our High Streets and local shopping centres, as well as reviewing the digital economy and on-line market places.\nWe are working hard to help, including schemes to help small businesses with their rates, and I am pleased to see that Government will be launching a consultation in to High Streets. As soon as details are available I will be encouraging local responses however, in the meantime, if you would like to let me know your views and ideas then please do e-mail me at wendy.morton.mp@parliament.uk\nFor those of you who regularly follow my column you will know that I often refer to the many local groups and the hard-working and dedicated volunteers who work quietly behind the scenes, supporting our communities. Their impact is huge, with even the smallest contributions collectively making a big difference. Often referred to as part of Civil Society, they are the bedrock of many a locality up and down the country, and indeed can be the ‘glue’ that holds a community together.\nA strong Civil Society is also a sign of a strong democracy and as a country we must continue to strengthen these organisations as we seek to tackle today’s challenges and strengthen our communities – something that is recognised in the Government’s recent Civil Society Strategy.\nAn expertise of volunteers, charities, organisations and business that work together can help encourage greater involvement in an area, often supporting our vital public services, and we are fortunate to have many excellent examples across the constituency, such as The Friends of Streetly Library, a group of dedicated and very active volunteers.\nWhilst the House of Commons pauses now for the autumn round of Political Conferences, it is a good time to be out and about across the Constituency starting with an excellent meeting and visit last week to St Annes Primary School on Blackwood Road.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 21st September 2018.\nI would welcome your comments and feedback on our High Streets and our local Shopping Centres from residents across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency. The future of our High Streets and Shopping Centres matters to me and if you would like to get in touch please e-mail me at wendy.morton.mp@parliament.uk or write to me at 82 Walsall Road, Aldridge, WS9 0JW.",

The Prime Minister’s determination has ensured that we are now progressing to phase two of the negotiations which will focus on developing a new partnership with the European Union. Progress continues on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill and we have now completed the Committee Stages of the legislation to ensure that when we leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 we are ready to stand tall as a truly global country.\nHowever, it is not all about Brexit, the Government are also getting on with the job of creating a country that works for everyone.\nThe Autumn Budget, which at its heart sought to continue to reward hard-working families with a further increase in personal tax allowances, a freeze on fuel duty, increased funding for the NHS and placing homeownership as a priority for future generations, is building on Britain’s recent economic achievements and sets out our ambition to rekindle the ‘British Dream’.\nThroughout this session of Parliament I have continued to raise the issue of Unauthorised Traveller Encampments and the effects they have had on our local area. Following persistent lobbying I was pleased that the Government agreed to a consultation on this matter. I am pleased that the Government have now confirmed that their call for evidence will include seeking the views of residents. I will of course be updating you as more information becomes available.\nRecently I participated in a debate on Backbench legislation, discussing the Interference with Wireless Telegraphy Bill. As part of my research for the debate I was shocked to learn that more than 13,000 mobile phones were freely available in our prisons and as part of the debate I made clear that people who go to prison should not have the connections and privileges that those of us in the outside world enjoy.\nA recent Westminster Hall debate on Society Lotteries gave me the opportunity to highlight the valuable contribution which these funds have made to so many charities and organisations including in my own Aldridge-Brownhills constituency. Contributions may not be vast in size compared to the National Lottery but the contributions made by Society Lotteries are big enough to make a difference to a number of community group projects across our local area.\nAs we approach the New Year it once again promises to be a busy time in Parliament and I will look forward to keeping you updated.",

Building on the ongoing work from when I was at the Ministry of Justice, I am pleased to see these measures come into force and offer protection and support for all victims.",

And, of course, summer brings with it the chance for a bit of relaxation with family and friends, and I will be spending some time on the canals and waterways we have here on our doorstep, heading on our boat towards the forthcoming Festival of Water on August Bank Holiday weekend at Pelsall.\nThe impact of unauthorized encampments on our local communities remains and I will continue to press Walsall Council for decisive action. Concerns have also been raised with me around the organization of our Remembrance Day parades this year, and though in the past we have relied on the Police to manage traffic and road closures, this year it will be for Walsall Council to use their powers to manage the borough parades and work more closely with voluntary groups.\nContinuing my participation in the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme, I recently visited RAF Shawbury to learn more about the training of RAF helicopter pilots and meet with servicemen and women, then to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to gain a deeper understanding of the role of British Forces in countering DAESH in Syria and Iraq. It was also a chance to learn more about the UN peacekeeping mission in Nicosia. As the wife of a former Royal Navy man I continue to take an active interest in our Armed Forces and defence and security of our country.\nWith the Honours system in the news again I am keen to ensure that we do not lose sight of the recognition that is given to the good work of individuals, businesses and voluntary groups. Here in the West Midlands much good work goes unrecognised compared to other parts of the country. Knowing of the local commitment to community service I would like to see more community nominations made. Information on how to nominate is available on the website www.gov.uk/honours. There is also the Queens Award to Voluntary Service and the Queens Awards for Enterprise with information on line at www.gov.uk/queens-awards-for-voluntary-service and www.gov.uk/queens-award-for-enterprise\nThe nomination process can take up to 18 months so don’t be put off if your nominee is not recognised straight away.",
  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_action-on-unauthorised-traveller-encampments-moves-a-step-closer/content_1560.html": "Having successfully persuaded the Government to hold a ‘Call for Evidence’ on the issue of Unauthorised Traveller Encampments that have repeatedly blighted large parts of the West Midlands and my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency, I am now pleased that the Government is proposing action to deal with this matter.\nThe Government’s ‘Call for Evidence’ has demonstrated the need to address the growing sense of unease and intimidation residents feel when an Unauthorised Traveller Encampment occurs. A strengthening of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to permit the Police greater powers to remove an Unauthorised Traveller Encampment will be welcomed across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.\nI also welcome the fact that the Home Office are going to undertake a review that will consider whether the Government should criminalise the act of trespassing when setting up an encampment. The Irish Government changed the law to make deliberate acts of trespass a criminal offence and it has been suggested that this change to the law is one of the reasons that so many travellers from the Republic of Ireland now come to the United Kingdom.\nI have always maintained that it is time for the travelling community to realise that the right to lead a travelling lifestyle does not equal a right to break the law. With rights, must come responsibilities and with responsibilities, must come respect.\nI have repeatedly raised this issue in Parliament because of concerns raised by my constituents who have faced repeated incursions and who now want to see the balance redressed and fairness put back into our communities. I believe there is now the will to strengthen the law and redress that balance.",

This is good news.\nWe are creating an economy that works for everyone and that is why we have introduced the National Living Wage, cut taxes for over 30 million people, introduced free childcare and implemented a modern Industrial Strategy to create better, well-paying jobs.\nWages are rising faster than prices – growth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets; another turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_my-article-in-the-nov-dec-neighbourhood-watch-magazine/content_202.html": "Dear Residents\nKnowing of the interest that local residents have shown in the future of Aldridge Police Station I wanted to update you on my most recent engagement with Simon Foster, our new Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) who was elected in May.\nI was pleased to be able to meet virtually with Mr Foster, and I congratulated him on his new role. I also pressed him on the matter of our local police station, urging him to drop the previous PCC’s plan to close Aldridge Police Station. In setting out the arguments for this I included the strength of feeling locally on this matter.\nWhilst the plan to close our Police Station remains on the table the new Commissioner has agreed that there should be a consultation. Although I welcome Mr Foster’s decision to consult, we all remember that the former Strategic Policing and Crime Board also agreed to consult, and no plan ever came forward. For this reason I will judge the decision taken by this Police and Crime Commissioner to consult the people of Aldridge by his actions.\nAny consultation on the future of our local Police Station must be meaningful. It must be inclusive and must seek to ensure we retain a local police base on the eastern flank of the Walsall Borough. The residents and local businesses of Aldridge deserve to keep a local Police base and we need to retain a Police Station in the Village of Aldridge.\nTurning to another issue which has kept us preoccupied locally – constituency boundaries. As many of you will be aware the Boundary Commission for England consulted over the summer about proposed changes to the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.\nSadly, the Commission proposed splitting the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency in two and creating a new Walsall constituency and a new Bloxwich and Brownhills constituency.\nIncluded within their proposal is the proposition of splitting the Village of Aldridge in half and placing Aldridge Central and South in the Walsall constituency and Aldridge North and Walsall Wood in the Bloxwich and Brownhills constituency.\nI have opposed these proposals and I am grateful to everyone who sent submissions to the Boundary Commission for England and signed my petition to ‘Keep Aldridge Together’.\nThe initial consultation was the first stage of the process. The Boundary Commission for England will now consider the objections they have received and produce revised proposals early in 2022. I will of course continue to keep you all updated on this matter.\nMeanwhile I would like to also update you that the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill has now passed all its stages in the House of Commons and is under consideration in the House of Lords. The proposed legislation will be of interest to residents’ across this constituency as it will provide new powers to deal with Unauthorised Traveller Encampments. Also contained within this legislation is the Government’s plan to create a new offence and an accompanying power for the police to seize property (including vehicles) to deal with the Unauthorised Encampments. The extent of the new law will make it an offence for a person to reside with a vehicle on land and fail to leave the land or remove their property without a reasonable excuse.\nI believe it will help redress the balance, respecting the rights of the travelling community whilst also respecting the rights of residents.\nIn closing I would like to extend my continued thanks and appreciation to the members of Neighbourhood Watch for your continued commitment and work, in support of local residents and our local community, and in support of the work of our local Neighbourhood Police Teams. Thank you.\nWith my best wishes\nWendy",

Although I have secured assurances from the current Police and Crime Commissioner that no further decision to close the Police Station will be made prior to next year’s scheduled elections, it remains very concerning that the proposal remains live and the Police and Crime Commissioner appears not to understand the value of maintaining a local police presence.\nSo, I am very pleased that Jay Singh-Sohal is working closely with me to help save Aldridge police station.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-brownfield-first-development-should-always-be-the-first-option/content_141.html": "As Parliament returns following the summer recess we begin to turn our attention to debating the Great Repeal Bill and Britain’s new future outside of the European Union but, we do so without the familiar background ‘bongs’ of Big Ben to guide our proceedings. Major conservation work being undertaken to The Elizabeth Tower means that Big Ben fell silent for the last time in August and with the exception of national events such as Remembrance Day, it will not resume regular duties until 2021.\nCloser to home my attention has been focussed in recent weeks on the Black Country Core Strategy, a critical planning and regeneration consultation document that covers the whole of the Black Country and my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency. Central to its ambition is meeting the development challenges and opportunities we will face in the next two decades. This strategy seeks to determine a plan for housing, employment, transport and the environment. It is vital that we have our say and that our views are heard and listened to. In particular I want to ensure that this strategy does not simply grant developers a license to destroy our much-loved Green Belt.\nSince becoming your Member of Parliament, I have always fiercely defended our Green Belt. Time and again in the recent general election campaign residents from across the constituency endorsed my campaign for a ‘Brownfield First’ approach towards development and regeneration to always be the first option.\nIn my response to the consultation I have therefore made it clear that our much-loved Green Belt is vital to protecting our local communities. Sensible and sustainable development is what is needed, not a route to Aldridge-Brownhills becoming simply a suburb of a ‘Greater Birmingham’.\nThe Black Country Core strategy must surely also be an opportunity to review and update the regeneration plans of our local centres and High Streets and that includes keeping Ravenscourt in Brownhills firmly on the radar for action by Walsall Council.\nThere are two further important public consultations at the moment, both by NHS Walsall Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) which I would encourage you to have your say on too as they affect us locally – ‘Hospital Stroke Services’ at Walsall Manor and ‘Improving Urgent Care Services’. There is to be a public event on Wednesday 20 September at Aldridge Community Centre between 10am – 12 noon, and further details can be found at www.walsallccg.nhs.uk\nThis weekend I will once again be joining the many ladies who are taking part in The Starlight Walk around Aldridge in support of St Giles Hospice. Always enjoyable and always a reminder, if ever we need one, of the terrific work of our local hospice. I am looking forward to it.\nThis was first published by the Walsall Advertiser and the Sutton Observer on 8th September 2017.",

In the preceding two years Wendy served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ministers at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and to the Secretary of State for International Development.\nIn forming his first administration Prime Minister Boris Johnson appointed Wendy to the Government as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice: the first Member of Parliament for Aldridge-Brownhills to be appointed as a Government Minister.\nFollowing the Government’s re-election at the 2019 General Election Wendy was appointed as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. In December 2021 Wendy was appointed Rail Minister and Minister of State at the Department for Transport.\nUnder Prime Minister Liz Truss Wendy served as Government Chief Whip – and in doing so became the first female Conservative to hold this position, attended Cabinet and was appointed to the Privy Council.\nWendy returned to the back benches in October 2022 and has served on the Back Bench Business Committee and as a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.\nAs a backbench Member of Parliament, Wendy successfully steered two Private Members Bills through Parliament, both of which received Royal Assent and became law. The NHS (Charitable Trusts etc.) Act 2016 ensures that Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity retains the royalties to J.M. Barrie’s play Peter Pan. Her second Bill, The ‘Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Act 2017’ gives journalists the opportunity to examine public documents ensuring that there are greater levels of transparency and open government.\nFor many years Wendy has supported volunteering and social action and has been actively involved in local community projects. Before becoming MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, Wendy served as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and held responsibility for social action. She was also joint-project leader for international social action initiative Project Umubano, which has organised projects in Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone.\nHaving always had an interest in defence related issues Wendy successfully completed all the stages of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme learning more about the Royal Navy, the RAF and the British Army.\nOutside of politics Wendy has taken part in many charity walks and runs.

Jobs in mining resulted in a population surge in Aldridge to 2,478 by 1901, and by 1906 two of the mines known locally as ‘Drybread’ near Coppice Road and ‘Bare Bones’ at Leighswood together employed nearly 1,500 men. The Brownhills Miner, a 40ft statue standing at the end of Brownhills High Street is a wonderful reflection of our proud industrial past.\nSome of the most famous clay products in the world originate in Aldridge-Brownhills. Most recently the clay for Paul Cummins’, stunning art installation “Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red” (the poppies which were installed at the tower of London) came from the Potclays plant in Brownhills.\nHowever, the ceramics industry is approaching a worrying period.\nThe EU’s proposals for phase four of the Emissions Trading System suggesting a target of at least a 40% reduction in domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A key issue for the ceramics sector surrounds “Carbon Leakage” notably the evaluation of industries to be either deemed at risk of Carbon Leakage, or not.\nSome heavy clay industries will not meet the threshold for carbon leakage and therefore will be needing to purchase significantly more allowances. There is the possibility that some of the heavy clay producers in my constituency may have to buy all their carbon allowance after 2021, this will place a huge economic burden on an industry who’s energy costs already account for around 30% of their overall costs.\nThe ceramics industry is one of those most vulnerable to overcapacity within the Chinese Economy. If market economy status is conferred on China by the EU it will make the maintenance of the anti-dumping measures currently protecting tiles and tableware extremely unlikely. The progress the industry has made since 2011 will be lost and the industry put once again at risk if MES is conferred. The Government need to make an assessment on the impacts of Market economy status for China and the ceramics industry.\nWe cannot as a county decarbonise, by deindustrialising and shifting our carbon emissions to another part of the world. It is time for Government to look seriously at this issue, so that the industry can thrive and prosper.",

The proposed legislation to strengthen the law to protect emergency workers will help reduce the appalling 175 assaults recorded in the Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, the 1,312 assaults against our local police officers and the shocking statistic that as many as 17% of staff employed by Dudley and Walsall Mental Health have been assaulted.\nIn the debate I highlighted that our Emergency Workers are some of the most respected people in this country, and they should be able to do their job knowing that if anyone assaults them whilst carrying out their duties then the law will punish the perpetrators of such crimes.\nDuring Home Office questions I was able to raise the matter of the internet being used for radicalisation. Used in the right way, the internet provides entertainment, connectivity and interaction for millions of people across the world. However, terrorist groups have also recognised the power of this medium and are increasingly reaching out to young people using the web as a tool for recruitment and radicalisation.\nThroughout Home Office Questions I sought assurances from the Minister that the Government was doing everything it could to ensure that the world’s leading internet companies were playing their part and ensuring greater levels of corporate social responsibility to help us tackle this on-going problem. Tackling extremist content on the internet is vital in countering the terrorist narrative and stopping offences that incite terrorism. There is considerable effort going into removing extremist material from the internet.\nThe Nuclear Safeguards Bill debated at the start of last week is another important piece of legislation as part of our preparations for existing the European Union in March 2019.\nThe Government’s legislation establishes a UK nuclear safeguards regime which ensures that the UK continues to meet international standards for nuclear safeguards whilst maintaining our world-wide reputation as a responsible nuclear state.\nFriday was also a sitting day for Parliament last week and I was really pleased to speak in support of a very important bill that seeks to ensure that all families who lose a baby are given the bereavement support they need, including a new entitlement to child bereavement leave. This was a commitment in our Party manifesto at the last General Election and I am very pleased to see that it has now begun its passage into law. I am very aware of just how many bereaved parents have campaigned for paid compassionate leave in these circumstances and, like them, I am very pleased to see that Parliament is now leading the way in supporting parents in this way.\nThe week ahead in Parliament promises to be another busy week in which we will be considering legislation about electric vehicles, smart energy meters and the implementation of the Modern Slavery Act. I will of course continue to keep you all updated.",

Having a dog can greatly enhance life by offering companionship and boosting both physical and mental well-being. However, it’s crucial for owners to understand their obligations to their pets.\nEngaging with campaigners on this crucial matter was truly inspiring. Responsible dog ownership plays a vital role in effective dog management and contributes positively to the dog’s well-being and health.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_2020-christmas-message/content_365.html": "This is a very different Christmas message to any that I have written before. I know that for many this Christmas will be far from what was expected. It will be different. It will be challenging.\nChristmas is of course a time to remember and celebrate the birth of Christ. It is also an opportunity to pause for a moment and reflect: to remember those who are elderly, unwell or alone at Christmas, and those less fortunate than ourselves: to acknowledge the service and dedication of our Armed Forces and the brave work of the men and women who work tirelessly to keep us safe and secure: and to recognise those who work around the clock, to provide life-saving healthcare, policing, fire and rescue, and emergency services for us all.\nThis year in particular we have seen our local communities, churches and faith groups adapt and find ways to offer support to those in need. Walsall Council and Walsall Housing Group have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to provide vital services and their work continues. There are many more, including our teachers and local businesses who have also stepped up to the challenges of Covid-19.\nBut, above all, we remember the dedication and commitment of our NHS staff and all those key workers who are working at the front line in our battle against Covid-19, the teams of staff, and the volunteers, who work alongside them, and the families at home who support them. I thank you all.\nAt local neighbourhood and street level I am proud of the tremendous ways in which groups and individuals have responded and demonstrated how our real sense of community spirit continues albeit in different ways: from acts of kindness, and help with shopping, to events such as the walking Christmas Tree festival in Streetly, and the street “carnival” in Pelsall, on-line Church Services and the annual Act of Remembrance.\nReflecting on the past year and the evolving Covid-19 pandemic, we have learnt new ways to communicate and keep in touch and now more than ever is a time to reach out to those we love, to friends and to neighbours, to those we support, or who have lost a loved one, and who may be feeling isolated or alone at Christmas.\nOver 500,000 doses of the vaccine have now been given to people across the UK to protect those most at risk from coronavirus, but the battle against Covid-19 continues. it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to continue to play our part, follow the rules, and remember hands, face and space.\nI send you all my best wishes for Christmas and the New Year.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_the-budget-2021/content_47.html": "Yesterday the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out on behalf of the Government a budget that seeks to look to a more optimistic future as we move beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. Whilst we have endured challenging times, the budget prepares a new economy with higher wages, higher skills and rising productivity which will deliver for all the residents of Aldridge-Brownhills.\nOur ability to be able to successfully fight the Covid-19 pandemic was due to the enormous effort of our precious National Health Service. It was therefore extremely welcome news that there would be further investment in our NHS with a commitment to 40 new hospitals and the recruitment of 50,000 new nurses.\nThe budget once again reaffirmed our commitment to hard working families with a 6.6% increase in the National Living Wage equivalent of £1,000, and a tax cut for families on Universal Credit putting more money back in their pockets. Recognising the squeeze that so many families are feeling due to the increase in fuel prices the Chancellor scrapped the anticipated rise in fuel duty, saving families’ money at the pumps will be welcomed.\nThe Government’s priority as we move beyond the global pandemic is an ambitious programme of frontline investment to level up right across our country to close the gap between London and regions like ours. As independent commentators have observed our economy is fundamentally strong and whilst Covid-19 has had an impact on our economy, the Government stands on the side of families and businesses to support our precious public services and business community.\nPublic services are the People’s Priorities and at the heart of the budget was support for young people with an investment of over £500 million in youth services, 30,000 new school places for Special Educational Needs, a further £3 billion to help all pupils as part of the Covid-19 education recovery fund and a £4.7 billion of funding for education meaning per pupil funding will rise on average to £1,500 per pupil.\nWith sustained investment to deliver on key infrastructure projects, research and development and a commitment to greater productivity across the economy we will deliver on our ambition for Britain to be a global leader. With record investment in new transport projects the West Midlands Mayor Andy Street will receive more than £1billion for new transportation projects across our region to help level up our local areas and extend our economic reach. At the same time the new funding also represents a major step forward to realise my long held ambition to reopen a railway station in Aldridge.\nA commitment to build 180,000 new affordable new homes with a £1.8 billion investment in brownfield development means we will get the homes we need in the right places. It will also mean that we can protect our precious Green Belt and truly live up to our ambition of a ‘Brownfield First’ approach to development.\nThis additional funding will be extremely important to all of us in Aldridge-Brownhills as we continue to work with Mayor Andy Street to stop speculative and unsuitable development on our precious Green Belt and Open Spaces.\nSupporting businesses and High Streets is a key part of our economic recovery and I was pleased the Chancellor announced the long awaited review of Business Rates. I was also pleased that next year’s planned increases in Business Rates have been halted and that our Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Sector will receive a 50% discount, helping our High Streets and Village Centres through challenging times.\nAs a Government we are focussed on ensuring that we have Higher Skills, Higher Productivity and Higher Wages focussing on the ‘People’s Priorities’. The Budget represents our commitment to level up right across the whole United Kingdom delivering on our promises to the British people and all of the hard working families of Aldridge-Brownhills.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-column-4/content_1180.html": "Parliamentary recess provides MPs with time away from what is often described as the ‘Westminster Village’ and allows the opportunity to spend more time in and around the constituency to catch up on casework and see at first hand those things that matter to constituents.\nOn Thursday morning last week I had the privilege of visiting the Midlands Air Ambulance team at its base at RAF Cosford. Arriving on site I watched as the helicopter took off, and on its return to base I met the team. The chance to learn of the incredible work they and the support staff do, taking emergency kit with a doctor and a paramedic out to the patient; their professionalism and dedication to duty was clear. ‘Saving Lives by Saving Time’ is their strap line and for me it sums up in a nutshell exactly what they do.\nThis year the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity is celebrating its 25th Anniversary and has an exciting programme of events. I hope that we may all take part in these activities. It requires £7million each year to ensure the helicopters remain operation – all funded by donations and fundraising. A great achievement.\nThe Government is keen to support the work of air ambulances and I recently supported the bid from the Midlands Air Ambulance for LIBOR funds – fines which were paid by banks for breaking the law by manipulating interest rates. I really hope our local air ambulance is successful in their bid for a new helicopter. It is an excellent charity worthy of our support.\nAnother recent and timely visit was to the Weinerberger works in Aldridge. From clay to bricks and even sanitary ware, the ceramic industry is not just a part of our local heritage, it also makes an important contribution to the local economy, and employs around 300 people in the constituency.\nStanding on top of the kiln at Weinerberger, watching the red hot bricks as they were fired, I could see for myself the energy intensity of this industry and how access to secure and internationally-competitive priced energy supplies is critical to success. Our manufacturers need to be able to compete on a level playing field on energy and climate costs both with EU and non-EU competitors. It is with this in mind that I stood for, and was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the new All Party Parliamentary Group on Ceramics, formed to discuss policy issues impacting on the ceramics manufacturing sector, and to raise questions and greater awareness in Parliament.\nWhen Parliament returns from the Easter recess my role as an MP, to scrutinize the work of our government will continue. I will raise these important matters with Government, for the sake of local jobs and industries. We need a manufacturing base here to supply the bricks and ceramics that are needed to meet the growing demand to build new homes.",

Whilst this was only partial suffrage, it was a huge victory and a big first step that propelled the ongoing campaign and right for equality. Throughout the course of 2018 “Vote 100” has celebrated a century of women’s voices in Parliament and the milestones in the journey towards universal suffrage and the first women MPs. This week marks another democratic landmark of 1918 when the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act was passed allowing women to stand for Parliament. It was less than one month later on 14 December 1918 when 8.5 million women were eligible to stand and vote in their first ever election. A year later and in December 1919 Nancy Astor was the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons. Some 96 years later and I was the 431st female Member of Parliament to be sworn in and take my seat on the Green Benches. We still have a long way to go; however we can at least boast that a century later our Head of State, our Prime Minister and the President of the Supreme Court are all female. |\n| Back to Parliamentary business and whilst Brexit negotiations continue, the Finance Bill is currently going through Parliament, implementing the Budget. I was pleased to see the Chancellor give a welcome boost to our High Streets and small businesses, cutting business rates by a third and outlining a new ‘Future High Streets Fund’ supported with £675 million of additional resources to help transform them. I am hoping that locally we will see the benefit of this too. Small businesses are the lifeblood of local communities and remain the backbone of our High Streets and Village Centres, and of course our Industrial Estates and Business Parks too.\nAs your Member of Parliament I have had the privilege of meeting many small businesses that are working hard to serve their customers, grow their business and play an active role in creating job opportunities. With this in mind, on Saturday 1 December I will be out and about talking to some of our local small businesses in support of Small Business Saturday.

Set against a backdrop of challenging times, it delivers certainty and lays the foundations for future prosperity based on protecting jobs and creating new jobs.\nA central element of the measures unveiled by the Chancellor today is to help the 700,000 young people leaving education this year, offering greater access to careers support, apprenticeships and a new ‘Kick Start Scheme’ to help young people aged 16-24 into 25-hours work per week of paid employment.\nThe package also includes a jobs retention bonus offering employers a £1,000 bonus for every employee that they are able to successfully return to work following an end to the furlough scheme, giving employers greater certainty and reward for protecting workers’ jobs.\nChanges to help stimulate demand in our economy have also been unveiled to help consumers and businesses as we seek to support home owners and our High Streets – from today changes to stamp duty up until the end of March will take nine out of ten people out of stamp duty by raising the threshold to £500,000. A temporary VAT cut to 5% to support our hospitality and tourism sector cutting costs on food, accommodation and attractions and a targeted scheme throughout August (Monday, Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s) ‘Eat out to Help Out’ giving a 50% reduction up to the value of £10 at participating pubs and restaurants for all of us.\nAs part of the Government’s response to help create new jobs the Chancellor has given a new commitment of £2bn for Green Home Grants to help homeowners with green home improvements such as loft, wall and floor insulation with a government backed grant which will help us to create 140,000 new green jobs.\nThe Government’s immediate priority is to stabilise our economy as a result of the impact of Covid-19. As a result of the hard work of the British people over the last 10-years the foundations of our economy are strong and whilst there is an impact on our economy the Government stands on the side of families and businesses to continue to support our precious public services, business community and individuals to ensure that we Support, Create and Protect Jobs across our whole country.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-westminster/content_829.html": "As a new Member in the House of Commons, my first opportunity to speak came with my maiden speech. It was a chance to pay tribute to my predecessor Sir Richard and to follow the tradition of sharing with other MPs in the Chamber a few facts about the wonderful and unique communities that make up the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.\nThere is much to learn in this place, from procedures to policies, and of course the sound of the division bell – the signal it’s time to vote! I’ve been asking questions of Ministers about healthcare and education and following the debates that affect us here locally as well as nationally.\nIndeed, during this Parliament we will be debating some far-reaching constitutional matters including Scotland and the forthcoming EU referendum as well as plans for regional devolution.\nWe hear much about plans for a “Northern Powerhouse” and much closer to home I am pleased that discussions for a new West Midlands-wide combined authority have begun to take shape. Local councils are playing an active role, as indeed they should, and a combined authority will be a catalyst for greater powers and responsibility, investment and economic growth. I believe we can benefit from this and if the North is the “Powerhouse” then we in the Midlands are the “Engine Room”, driving growth and jobs locally.\nLocalism is quite rightly about devolving power downwards from Whitehall. It’s important therefore that discussions recognise the geography and diversity of this region and that we do not see our voice drowned out by that of larger, and louder, neighbouring authorities.\nOf course there are still questions to be asked and to be answered especially around “Metro Mayors” and I look forward to hearing these and Aldridge-Brownhills being part of that discussion.\nIn the meantime, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics bring the welcome news that employment is up locally, and it was good to read in our local press that RMD Kwikform in Aldridge has been shortlisted in the 2015 Construction News Awards, a further sign of the potential we have right here on our doorstep to power the Midlands “Engine Room.”\nA version of this article was originally published in the Walsall Advertiser and Sutton Coldfield Observer on June 25.",

Since 2010 there have been over a million new businesses nationally, 99% of which are Small Medium Enterprises. Across the UK small businesses give 12.5 million hard working families the security of a weekly income.

Since first being elected in 2015 I have had the privilege to meet many small businesses who are working hard to serve their customers, grow their business and play an active role in improving employment opportunities for local people. I am proud of this Government’s record over the last eight years in its support for businesses and creating jobs. However, we can do more and we should do more. I am determined to continue to champion the needs of small business; support them in our local community and represent their views in Government.

By-elections, either at local or national level can bring interesting and even historic results, and last week, as we saw in Copeland, was no exception. The result was a clear demonstration of the support for Theresa May’s vision and policies for our country, that reach out to improve the lives of everyone.\nMeanwhile, back to business and I am pleased that the Article 50 Bill, which seeks to give the Prime Minister permission to formally trigger the process of leaving the EU, continues its passage through Parliament. Let us hope that progress in the House of Lords continues to be made unhindered and that we can finally get on with the beginning of the process to formally negotiate our position outside of the EU.\nCloser to home and one of the issues that is often raised with me locally and which I in turn regularly raise in Parliament, and comment upon is the protection of our precious greenbelt. I was therefore pleased to hear at Prime Ministers Questions recently that the Government reiterated that it is very clear that the greenbelt must be protected, and boundaries only altered when local authorities have fully examined all other reasonable options.

And whilst I am very conscious of the housing pressures across the wider West Midlands Combined Authority area, I am pleased to hear that the “Brownfield First’ approach is a pledge made by Mayoral candidate Andy Street.\nWeekends back home from Westminster would not be complete without my regular constituency surgeries, meeting and visits and so I was delighted to be able to round off last week, with a visit to the wonderful Walsall Silver Thread Tapestries whilst they were on display at the Village Centre in Pelsall. It has been estimated that each tapestry represents at least 2000 sewing hours by volunteers. They capture so much of our local history, and the spirit of community. They are simply stunning!\nAnd a final shout for the week must go to Rushall for a fun evening of sausage and mash, and skittles! – clear demonstration of the very essence of communities coming together for an enjoyable evening whilst also fundraising for a local cause.\nFor those of you living in the Brownhills area I will be holding another one of my pop-up surgeries at the Community Association on March 10th. If you would like to make an appointment please get in touch with my office on 01922 452228.",

This progress means we can now start to develop a new and special partnership with the European Union to trade freely, whilst ensuring that we leave the Single Market, and the Customs Union as well as the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\nHowever, at this time of year I am reminded of the importance of reflecting on what matters to us each as individuals, to put politics aside, and think about family and friends and those who are elderly, unwell or alone at Christmas. We should also acknowledge the sense of dedication of our Armed Forces and those who provide lifesaving healthcare, policing, fire and rescue and emergency services for us around the clock.\nI am also mindful of all those community groups and voluntary organisations who work tirelessly and quietly across our local communities. During the course of 2017 I have had the opportunity to meet with many more of you and there are certainly far more than I can mention here but your work does not go unnoticed nor is it unappreciated. Week in week out I see the wonderful work which goes on across our strong network of local Churches, the continued effort of groups such as the Aldridge Volunteer Gardeners and the tremendous contribution of volunteers across the constituency to deliver this year’s Act of Remembrance parades.\nOn a personal note, one of the highlights of 2017 was the privilege of once again being returned as your Member of Parliament. It remains an honour for me to represent you at Westminster.\nI like many of you will be spending some time with my family and friends over Christmas.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_sustainable-development-goals-foreign-aid-expenditure-debate/content_101.html": "On Monday I spoke in the Foreign aid Expenditure debate in Westminster Hall.\nYou can read my contribution to the debate below, and also find a link to the whole debate.\nhttp://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/d3ed341d-af80-4b35-aee4-f1e20d8f40c4?in=16:30:00\nWendy Morton:\nI am a member of the International Development Committee and co-chair of the all-party group for sustainable development goals, so it is a pleasure to support colleagues on both sides of the Chamber who are speaking in favour of the 0.7%. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on foreign aid spending and, to be precise, the 0.7%. Given the backdrop of the need to secure the UK’s economic recovery, it is right to consider the spending of all Departments, not only DFID’s. We need to ensure that we deliver value for taxpayers’ money and that we understand what does and does not work.\nBefore I was elected to this place, I had the opportunity through Project Umubano, which was set up by the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend and constituency neighbour the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell), to spend time in Rwanda, Burundi and Sierra Leone, so that I could learn about international development by seeing it for myself. I took that opportunity because I wanted and felt that I needed to gain a more detailed understanding of international development. I visited schools in rural Rwanda, a health clinic in Kirambi and NGO projects where they were showing people how to build livelihoods and encourage enterprise. I have too many stories. I would love to share them all with Members this afternoon, but I will move on because time is pressing. UK aid has contributed to many of those successes and many others around the world. In the last 40 years, extreme poverty has halved. Since 2000, deaths from malaria have decreased by 60%, saving more than 6 million lives. There are many other examples.\nMargaret Ferrier (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) (SNP)\nUK investment in immunisation saves a child’s life somewhere in the world every two minutes. Does the hon. Lady agree that such immunisation programmes not only enable better health in poorer countries but provide an important roadblock to more widespread epidemics\nWendy Morton\nThe hon. Lady makes a powerful point, and I agree. A lot of work is done by DFID and in the charitable sector by organisations such as Rotary to help to eradicate disease. The UK continues to lead the way. It is working to help women and girls by tackling female genital mutilation and preventing sexual violence against women. The breadth of the work that DFID is involved in is exemplary. I believe that we have a moral duty to do such work, but also that it is firmly in our national interest. It can help to strengthen our long-term security and is a vital part of protecting our prosperity as well as helping to foster peaceful diplomacy. As we have seen in recent years with the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone and the ongoing crisis with the Syrian refugees, the UK is at the forefront of international development work.\nDr Philippa Whitford (Central Ayrshire) (SNP)\nI got the chance to visit Ethiopia and see the structures that came about because of polio eradication. It was exactly these structures that were able to detect that the Ebola crisis was developing, so we protect ourselves as well as protecting others.\nWendy Morton\nThe hon. Lady makes a very valuable point. The benefit of such debates is that they enable us to share many examples of projects and the experiences that we have all had. We face a choice: either seek to tackle the root causes of poverty and therefore many of the great global challenges we face, or wait for the problem—be that the threat of mass migration, terrorism, disease, corruption or global climate change—to arrive here on our doorstep, by which point it is often too late.\nWe have already heard that the 0.7% target is not new. To be honest, I was surprised to find while doing my research that it was actually first accepted in principle back in 1974 by the then Labour Government. Subsequent Conservative Governments also accepted it in principle, and it was finally enshrined in law by the coalition Government. It is important to remember that the 0.7% aid target that we are discussing is 0.7% of gross national income. Let us be clear: that is not “wealth”, as indicated in the title of the petition. That means that aid spending could in theory come down: if GNI comes down, that 0.7% as an amount will also come down.\nCritics will say that we should spend only what we need to spend. I get that. I understand that we have to deliver value for taxpayers’ money, but that has to be balanced and put in context. We are often faced with very complex situations. For example, with Ebola, I fear that if we had waited for too long, the situation that we faced would have been much larger and we would yet again have faced the charge of having done too little, too late.\nThere is growing global inequality in terms of peace. The most peaceful states are more peaceful than ever, but some of the most fragile states are more fragile than ever. That is why I welcome the shift in the Government’s aid strategy to place a greater focus on supporting such fragile states. That often requires a much longer-term approach, which can often bring challenges, and it is certainly not without risks, but without security and stability, development is not possible and it is not possible to move beyond dependency upon humanitarian aid.\nI will turn briefly to governance, accountability and transparency. The e-petition states that our aid is leading to “waste and corruption”. I believe it is for DFID to always answer and make its case for the work it does. I am a member of the International Development Committee, which holds inquiries into the Department’s work, and it is also scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee, which recently published a report, the National Audit Office and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, which I believe was set up while my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield was Secretary of State. The purpose of that organisation is to scrutinise DFID’s work and ODA spending. I would like to see more scrutiny. We have yet to fully make the case for aid to the British public. We all have a part to play in doing that. I would like to see more cross-Department inquiries to better reflect the way that the 0.7% cuts across Departments. The case for 0.7% is an important one. It is worthy of scrutiny and debate, but in my view it is worthy of our support.",

At the same time there will also be additional support for people receiving Universal Credit who will benefit from having support for upfront childcare costs. These two specific measures will help remove barriers to work for large numbers of parents and will give the economy a large injection of economic growth.\nI was pleased that we are giving householders greater certainty on their energy bills by extending the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for a further 3 months.

This will save families money at the pumps and combined with more money for Walsall Council to fill potholes this will be welcomed by all motorists.\nThe Chancellor’s decision to give £30 million to support our veterans helps honour our commitment to those who have served on behalf of our country. An additional £10 million to the third sector to help address suicide support alongside a further £100 million to support local charities and organisations are all measures to be applauded.\nAt the heart of the budget was a new landmark devolution deal which will deliver the West Midlands under the stewardship of Mayor Andy Street significant new powers and resources.\nThe new deal will offer £500 million extra for housing. Importantly for residents across Aldridge-Brownhills it also gives greater flexibility to undertake brownfield regeneration as well new powers to deliver affordable housing allowing us to get the right homes in the right places and protect our precious Green Belt.\nA further funding commitment for transport infrastructure will hopefully keep our ambition for a station with Aldridge on track. Additional financial powers allowing the retention of business rates for the next 10 years will give the region an estimated further £45 million a year of economic fire power.\nThe deal also offers the West Midlands further influence over key policy areas such as skills, careers, employment support and digital inclusion. This represents a major step forward for the West Midlands in allowing more freedom and flexibility to support people into work, attain better skills and improve our quality of life.\nAs a Government we remain focused on our key priority to drive greater levels of growth throughout the British economy and today we remain steadfast in delivering a plan for growth for the benefit of all the hard working families across Aldridge-Brownhills.",

I encourage parents, grandparents, and carers my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency to spend ten minutes reading with their children on World Book Day and every day after.\nSharing stories regularly, whether at home, school, or any place, for just ten minutes a day, can have a lasting positive impact on children’s future. World Book Day collaborates with authors, illustrators, publishers, bookshops, and libraries to promote reading for pleasure among children and young people.\nWe are fortunate in Aldridge-Brownhills to have outstanding community libraries and schools that support reading and foster the lifelong love of reading for pleasure.",
  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_north-aldridge-neighbourhood-watch-article/content_1263.html": "I am delighted to be able to contribute to this edition of the Aldridge North Neighbourhood Watch Magazine.\nSince I last wrote for the magazine at the beginning of March we have indeed been living through unprecedented times. Covid-19 has brought many challenges to us as individuals, as families and as communities and we have endured some of the most draconian measures as a nation in peacetime as we seek to fight the battle against this virus.\nI know that for many people the lockdown brought hardship and social isolation. Our natural instinct as human beings is to socialise and mix with our friends and family, and yet a major requirement in the battle to flatten the peak of the pandemic required us all to stay at home so that we could protect our precious NHS, and the lives of our loved ones, friends and neighbours.\nHowever, if I were to take one thing from the lockdown it is the increased sense of neighbourliness we have seen, whether it was the Thursday night ‘Clap for Carers’ or the extra mile so many have gone to, in supporting others with either a friendly word, a phone call or a helping hand.\nRight across my constituency I have been touched by the generosity of so many people who have helped others, and not least the on-going work of the Neighbourhood Watch in supporting its members and the wider community. Thank you to you all.\nAnd now, at the point of writing this article, the rate of infection for Covid-19 has regrettably increased and new measures including the ‘Rule of 6’ have now been implemented in law to ensure that we protect ourselves and the wider community from this indiscriminate disease. My message to everyone is to continue to follow the rules and the guidance, and stay safe.\nTurning to other local matters, it was regrettable that during lockdown in Aldridge we had a number of Unauthorised Traveller Encampments. Several constituents contacted me and I worked closely with Walsall Council to ensure that the encampments were removed and the sites cleared at the earliest opportunity. As a result of these latest Unauthorised Encampments I wrote to the Home Secretary, the Rt. Honourable Priti Patel MP to request an update on the Government’s consultation to strengthen the law to deal with this issue. I have been assured that the Government remain committed to action on this issue.\nI am also very aware that throughout lockdown and the broader Covid-19 response, our local Police have been at the forefront of dealing with the pandemic, and they deserve our sincere thanks. This has further reinforced my belief in the importance of local Neighbourhood policing, and that our local Police force need to retain a local base in our area. I have therefore once again written to the Police and Crime Commissioner about his plans to close Aldridge Police Station.\nWhilst I have been assured that no decision to close Aldridge Police Station will be taken before next year’s Police and Crime Commissioner election, I will be continuing to follow this very closely. I remain firmly of the belief that no decision should be taken without a full and proper consultation, and furthermore, that there must be a continued base for our local officers. Local police stations are at the very heart of responsive community policing, and that includes here in Aldridge.\nI once again want to reiterate my sincere thanks to everyone involved with the Aldridge North Neighbourhood Watch for all that you do to help keep our local community safe. Take care and stay safe.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-colum-post-referendum/content_89.html": "Last Friday the view of the people towards the European Union rang out loud and clear and so now the work must begin to implement the result of what was an historic referendum for our country. Their will must be respected. It was clear that people feel their concerns about unsustainable migration have been ignored for too long and that its time to do something about it.\nThe majority of residents voting in my constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills expressed their wish to leave the EU and so I will do everything I can to make sure this happens and in a way that minimises the risk and benefits all of us in our daily lives, at work and in our businesses.\nAs the country looks to a new future we must now work together on all levels to make the best of this decision, to get the best for our country and, importantly, ensure stability, unity and prosperity within our communities.\nReflecting on the importance of unity and togetherness brings with it a reflection on the tragic death of Jo Cox MP and an awakening of a deep disconnect between the public and elected politicians. Events of the last few weeks must be a reminder to us all for a genuine commitment to try and re-earn trust in our politics, to do politics better, and to be more accessible and accountable to the people and communities we serve.\nI am saddened that the Prime Minister has decided that the country needs new leadership to take the referendum result forward but it is a decision I fundamentally respect. Whilst some will undoubtedly disagree with me, I believe the country has been fortunate to have his leadership and he undoubtedly brought many reforms into politics and into our party. However, as the selection of a new Prime Minister begins, the work of Government, the work of Parliament and my work as your local constituency MP must, and will, continue.\nWith that in mind, Friday was my regular constituency advice surgery, it was an absolute pleasure to be able to accept an invitation to Millfield Primary School in Brownhills and watch their spectacular performance of The Lion King. It was absolutely fantastic! The amount of hard work and effort put in by all those involved both on stage and behind the scenes was very clear. The weekend was rounded off with the Brownhills Canal Festival, a fun day for all. The usual stalls plus entertainment from the Aldridge Ukulele Band, the Mercia Brass Band and boat trips on the canal.",

Local residents were understandably worried about conversations they had seen taking place on social media about a potential large-scale development on the site and the impact it would have on Streetly, and our local services, and the detrimental impact likely to be caused by loss of the Green Belt.\nI am pleased to report that it has been confirmed to me that this site, and a potential development known as “Columba Park”, is not the subject of a planning application. However it demonstrates to me exactly why we need to remain vigilant about any such development and the need for us to continue to seek safeguards for our precious Green Belt and Open Spaces against speculative development.\nIt is worth noting however that the Queslett Road East site has been highlighted in the proposed Black Country Core Strategy which has been commissioned by the four Black Country Councils, including Walsall. In August 2017 I submitted my own comments to the consultation and through this column encouraged other residents to do the same. The strategy is essentially about planning for our future, including Housing, Employment, Environment and Transport.\nImportantly for us, this consultation is looking at housing needs up to 2036, and seeks to identify future growth areas within the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and surrounding area. I made clear in my submission to the consultation that, when considering housing development, we should always take a ‘Brownfield first’ approach allowing us to protect our precious Green Belt.\nWhilst it had been envisaged that the next round of public consultation on the Black Country Core Strategy was to be towards the end of 2019 it is my understanding that this is now likely to be in early 2020. I will seek to continue to keep residents informed of any further progression or update I become aware of. In the meantime if residents would like to look at further details about this strategy they can do so by visiting www.blackcountrycorestrategy.dudley.gov.uk/\nTo be clear, I would like to assure you that I remain committed to the protection of our Green Belt and Open Spaces. I will continue to advocate a Brownfield First development strategy and as long as I am your Member of Parliament I will seek to protect the interests of Streetly ensuring that we are not simply subsumed into a suburb of a Greater Birmingham.\nParliament is now in a short recess for Easter, but locally my work continues, and as ever I look forward to meeting you when I am out and about. This weekend we celebrate Easter, the most important and oldest festival of the Christian Church, celebrating the resurrection of Christ. Let us also celebrate this Easter the strong tradition that we have in our country for religious tolerance and freedom of speech.\nLet me also take this opportunity to wish you a peaceful and Happy Easter.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 19th April 2019.",

However, I want to see homes built in the right places and to a high standard.\nI was grateful for the support I received in Westminster Hall yesterday and I will continue to campaign on this important issue for all my Aldridge-Brownhills constituents.\nProtect our Precious Green Belt by having a building strategy which prioritises a ‘Brownfield First’ development policy.",

Local good causes and charities will be able to apply for funding of up to £20,000 until Wednesday 19th of August.\nEach of the four Trusts support projects focussed on different themes – details below\n- Postcode Neighbourhood Trust will help good causes affected by COVID-19.

In my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency they remain the backbone of our High Streets, Village Centres, and Industrial Estates. Last year there were a record 5.5 million businesses across the country and that is why I am delighted to be once again backing this year’s Small Business Saturday to showcase some of the amazing enterprise and innovation we have locally and the contribution small businesses make to our economy on a daily basis.\nSince 2010 there have been over a million new businesses nationally, 99% of which are Small Medium Enterprises. Across the UK small businesses give 12.5 million hard working families the security of a weekly income. There are so many fantastic small businesses employing people locally and serving our community from day to day.\nAs someone who set up a family business, I know from first-hand experience the risks and challenges which people take. Since first being elected in 2015 I have had the privilege to meet many small businesses who are working hard to serve their customers, grow their business and play an active role in improving employment opportunities for local people.\nI am proud of this Government’s record over the last seven years in its support for businesses and creating jobs. However, we can do more and we should do more. I am determined to continue to champion the needs of small business; support them in our local community and represent their views in Government.\nThis year’s Small Business Saturday will be taking place on Saturday 2 December and I will be out and about across Aldridge-Brownhills talking to the small businesses on our High Streets and in our Village Centres, but I also want to hear from you about what more the Government can be doing to ensure we continue to see increasing numbers of small businesses and jobs created in Aldridge-Brownhills.\nIf you are a local business, please feel free to get in touch with your thoughts and ideas or if you would like me to visit your company to learn more about the work you are doing.

Closer to home though I am looking forward to the Community Fun Day at St Thomas’ Church in Aldridge on Saturday and the Music Festival at All Saints, Streetly and an invitation to a birthday tea party in Rushall.\nWith communities coming together to join in the celebrations it is worth remembering that even in today’s world of the internet, social media, and the many so called mobile phone ‘apps’, that I claim to be no expert in, catching up with friends, family and neighbours is a vital ingredient of family life and strong communities. So too are the many community leaders and, organisations, and the many volunteers, who work, often quietly behind the scenes, to organise events such as these this weekend. They deserve our thanks.\nThe Queen has had 12 Prime Ministers, and several Governments, serving our country through extraordinary times. Yet throughout the years she has remained a rock of strength providing continuity and stability for all.\nAs we celebrate the 90th birthday of our country’s longest reigning monarch we are also reminded of her life of service and a duty to our country that began long before she became Queen. To those of us who seek to represent our constituencies and make a contribution to public life it is a reminder of the privilege and humility that such a position holds.\nI am keeping my fingers crossed for continuing good weather this weekend as we wish her Majesty well for her 90th birthday, but sadly the good weather has heralded some unwelcome visitors – the arrival to Aldridge-Brownhills once again of unauthorised encampments on our open community fields and common areas.\nI first encountered the problem here prior to last year’s General Election. To see it return again to the same places as last year is very disappointing. We should not accept that transitory visitors to the Borough of Walsall are somehow treated differently to permanent residents. Their ease and ability to flout laws that are readily applied to residents for a common good is indefensible.\nI will therefore continue work with local councillors, Walsall Council, the Police and Parliament to find ways of deterring and further preventing these unwanted incursions into our communities that disrupt and damage our local environment. It is disappointing when so many work so hard to maintain the amenities of our local area that this can so easily be undermined by those who appear to enjoy a summer jaunt at our expense.",

As we are all aware the Covid-19 pandemic is not over, so as we approach Step Four we do so with caution.\nLast week the Prime Minister set out that now is the right moment to proceed, given we have the natural firebreak of the school holidays starting from today. To delay Stage Four until the autumn would run the risk of re-opening as the weather gets colder, giving the virus a natural advantage.\nAs part of today’s reopening the Government have issued guidance for businesses including our hospitality sector and for people using public transport. We have updated our guidance for the Clinically Extremely Vulnerable and we will maintain a robust border policy, including quarantine for those arriving from red list countries.\nTest, Trace and Isolate will continue to be a vital tool in the fight against Covid-19 but the single biggest thing that everyone can do to help fight the pandemic is get a jab.\nOur vaccination programme has been a huge success with two-thirds of all adults now having two jabs – so I would encourage everyone to come forward for their jabs as soon as possible.",

Whilst this was only partial suffrage, it was a huge victory and a big first step that propelled the ongoing campaign and right for gender parity.\nOn Tuesday it was a real privilege to be in Parliament and join other female Parliamentarians to mark this landmark anniversary.\nDuring the course of 2018 Vote 100 will celebrate a century of women’s voices in Parliament and the milestones in the journey towards universal suffrage and the first women MPs.\nIf you are planning a visit to London this summer it’s worth noting that there will be an exhibition “Voice and Vote: Women’s Place in Parliament” opening on 27th June at Westminster Hall. Throughout the exhibition, rare and previously unseen historic objects, pictures and archives from the Parliamentary collections and elsewhere will be on show. Together with immersive and interactive technologies, the exhibition will tell the story of women in Parliament, the campaigning, the protests and the achievements.\nTickets are free and available online from Tuesday 6th February.

Women were banned from the public galleries. Those who were politically engaged and wanted to watch discussions of issues they were campaigning for, such as the abolition of the slave trade, would make their way to this space to watch and listen. How things have changed and whilst we still have a long way to go we can at least boast in 2018 that our Head of State, Prime Minister and President of the Supreme Court are all female and at the end of last year Parliament formally appointed its first ever female Black Rod marking a historic moment in the history of the House.

Looking forward I am sure there will be many challenges ahead in 2016, however we have a government committed to overcoming these, whilst ensuring the economic recovery of the country continues and providing opportunity and security for all.\nLast weekend I joined with family and friends for the opening night of Dick Whittington at the Aldridge Youth Theatre. A family pantomime written by the gifted Neville Ellis, and directed by Dexter Whitehead, showcasing some of our local talent and skills. The scenery and cast were wonderous and colourful, from eccentric Bertha to the adorable Florrie from Pheasey, it’s full of fun characters. Not only is it worth going to see, but it supports our local community too.\nAldridge Youth Theatre is a registered charity and relies on the income from its productions. Like many charities it also depends on the time generously given by the many volunteers who support the performances, behind the scenes and front of house, as well as on stage. Thriving communities depend on people of all ages from all backgrounds coming together to share skills and experience, and we are very fortunate to have music and drama doing just that, locally in Aldridge.\nCharities, whether large or small, national or local, play a vital role in our communities and in our country and I have therefore taken a particular interest in Parliament in the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill which is currently passing through the House of Commons. The Bill seeks to give the Charity Commission new or strengthened powers to tackle misuse of charitable status more effectively, and provides stronger protection for charities in England and Wales from individuals who are unfit to be charity trustees. It also seeks to address concerns raised about maladministration which were highlighted through the media last summer. In all of this it’s important to recognise that the vast majority are run well by good and decent people, and they deserve our support and confidence.",

This is the set piece of British politics that many at home see on TV, along with the primary legislation that is debated on the green benches. But there is much, much more to the workings of Parliament, as I have been learning as a Government whip. Indeed Secondary Legislation also passes through Parliament, albeit in a slightly different way. This is legislation created by Ministers under laws given to them by an Act of Parliament often taking the form of a Statutory Instrument.\nSecondary Legislation provides practical measures that enable the law to be enforced and operate in daily life. A practical example of this was earlier in the year and the extension of licensing hours to allow people to celebrate the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s marriage. There are many hundreds of pieces of important legislation that take this course through Parliament, but which, importantly, are still open to scrutiny.\nWith Parliament undertaking preparations for us leaving the European Union a large number of these Statutory Instruments are being prepared across Government departments to ensure an orderly departure on 29 March 2019. This is work that often goes unnoticed by many but now more than ever, and with Brexit approaching, it is increasingly important.\nIn other news, across the NHS we are seeing that preparations are now well under way for winter, a topic I discussed back in the summer with Chief Executive Richard Beeken of Walsall Manor Hospital. There was also welcome news last week that in addition to the extra £145 million to improve emergency care facilities in our hospitals the Government has announced an additional £245 million of funding for local Councils for the social care system this winter is to be welcomed.\nThis means an extra £1.4 million for Walsall Council, which will ease pressure on our health service and assist Walsall Council with home care packages and adaptations to help patients leave hospital quicker, allowing people to regain their independence and confidence at home.\nAnother important part of the winter preparations in our health service is the annual flu jab, offered free to people who are at risk to help protect them and prevent against developing serious complications. I hope that as many as possible of you who are eligible will take advantage of the seasonal flu vaccination programme. I have certainly reminded members of my family.\nNext weekend marks the 100th Anniversary of the ending of the Great War. As we stop and come together for the annual Act of Remembrance, let us remember all those brave men and women who served our country, to ensure our freedom today, and let us also never forget our strength as a nation.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 2nd November 2018.",

The programme helps equip teenagers with the skills they need, whilst giving them opportunities to meet new people and experience new challenges.\nWith participation levels in NCS at a record high across the country, the summer programme at Manor Farm Community Association in Rushall is an inspiring example, linking with an excellent local community organisation that offers our area so much, including outreach to older people, support for individuals with learning difficulties, as well as courses and vocational training for people across Walsall.\nThroughout my visit to the NCS I was impressed by the enthusiasm for the scheme and just how proud everyone was of the work they had done and the skills they had achieved.

Often referred to by my colleagues as the “Peter Pan and Wendy” Bill, it has successfully completed another stage in its passage through Parliament last week before it goes to the Queen for Royal Assent. It has been a tremendous privilege, not to mention steep learning curve, in steering my Bill through Parliament, and I am so pleased that it will enable the new independent Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital Charity to continue to benefit from the Royalties to JM Barrie’s play Peter Pan which were so generously bequeathed to the hospital back in 1929.\nOnce a Public Bill has received Royal Assent it follows, according to long-standing tradition, that it be recorded on calfskin vellum, and it is then stored in Victoria Tower. As I am finding out, Parliament is steeped in history, tradition and protocol, and there is a debate soon to be had in the House of Commons about switching to the use of archival paper versus maintaining the tradition of printing record copies on velum, a tradition I support. Let’s not forget, without vellum we would not have Magna Carta, nor would be have the Domesday Book.

However I am certain we have one of the most successful post-war Chancellors of all time, continuing with the job of securing the economic recovery for our country, whilst also delivering security and opportunity for all and investment in the future.\nLocally, Midlands News have reported on the Black Country Local Enterprise Partnership pronouncement on the creation of 45,000 new homes in a Garden City stretching from Aldridge to West Bromwich – this is news to me.

It is a commercial venture seeking to usurp the planning system.\nA number of residents have spoken with me and contacted me about this matter and I have written to Walsall Council to express my concerns about this completely unnecessary planning variation. I have also pressed upon them the detrimental impact this will have to local residents living within the vicinity of the site.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-it-is-our-responsibility-to-look-after-our-environment/content_704.html": "The environment belongs to us all, whether that is locally, or whether we look past the boundaries of Streetly and the West Midlands, and to the UK and beyond. It is also our responsibility to look after our environment and our duty to play our part in leaving it in a better state for our children and for future generations.\nBefore Easter I was invited to join pupils and staff at Ryders Hayes School in Pelsall, alongside Professor Gatrad of WASUP (Walsall Against Single Use Plastic) at their Earth Day assembly. It was truly inspiring to see the children learning about taking care of their school environment, and the harmful effects of single use plastics. There are of course many other schools, groups, organisations, businesses and individuals who are involved with projects or who quite simply play their part locally to help the environment and the community because it is the right thing to do, whilst recognising the responsibility we all have as individuals.\nIn recent weeks we have seen that public interest and concern about our environment and climate change is growing and the voices being raised are calling for the Government to do more to address this fundamental issue.\nIn acknowledging that Climate Change is a threat we must all unite behind and seek to go further and faster, it is equally important to recognise that a global effort will be required to effect the greatest long-term change. Equally, we must recognise the many achievements that have been made already.\nImportantly, the Government has a 25 Year Environment Plan which sets out a framework to enable the ambition of leaving the environment in a better state than we found it. The Plan includes tackling the scourge of plastic, delivering cleaner air and water and crucially using new opportunities available to us to develop our own bespoke agricultural and fisheries policies to ensure that we have a more sustainable focus for future generations.\nTo date there have been some key environmental achievements which have included banning plastic microbeads and straws, introducing new charges for carrier bags, and doubling the fines for littering on our streets. Locally, Conservative-controlled Walsall Council is also working hard to tackle litter and fly-tipping – issues which matter to Streetly residents.\nWe should also be proud of our country’s world-leading role in tackling climate change and our transition to Clean Growth.\nIn other news it was a pleasure to be able to call in to the Friends of Streetly Library Annual General Meeting last weekend. The Friends are a great group of enthusiastic and committed volunteers who do terrific work to support our local community library. Thank you all.\nThis article was first published in the Royal Sutton Observer on Friday 10th May 2019.",

Had it not been for the dedication of a number of volunteers and the generosity of the funds raised locally then we would not have been able to hold the annual Act of Remembrance parades.\nIt is unacceptable to me as a Member of Parliament that our National Day of Remembrance can only be funded through the charity of others and I am therefore calling on the Police and Crime Commissioner in the West Midlands to reconsider their position and guarantee to the residents of Aldridge-Brownhills that on Sunday 11th November 2018 our Remembrance Day Parade will once again be funded.",

I was put through my paces for 45-minutes as we strolled through my music and literary choices while discussing my career and role as your Member of Parliament.\nMusic – My 8 Music Choices\n• Abba – Dancing Queen\nI grew up to the music of Abba! I have seen the film Mamma Mia several times, been to the musical twice. Abba is often the music of choice in my car and as I confessed on set as a youngster, together with my sister, I regularly listened to the song whilst singing along into our hairbrushes!!\n• Ed Sheeran – Perfect\nI just love his music.\n• Black Eyed Peas – I Gotta Feeling\nThis music always reminds me of running in the Yorkshire Dales and training for the Great North Run.\n• Andre Rieu – Ballade pour Adeline\nI love the music of Andre Rieu. This piece of music is just beautiful. On my list of things to do is to go to a concert in Maastricht.\n• Mark Knopfler/Dire Straits – Brothers in Arms\nThis music always reminds me of living in the North East of England and the music of Dire Straits always reminds me of days of going to Newcastle United matches and sitting on the terraces. We collected all the Dire Straits albums and we were lucky enough to hear Mark Knopfler in concert. Brothers in Arms is just one of many favourites.\n• Les Miserables – Do you hear the people sing\nLes Mis is one of the most dramatic and powerful films and stage shows I have ever seen. Event Pic\n• Adele – Set Fire to the Rain\nThis always reminds me of summers spent running volunteer social action projects in Africa – and sitting back on the long-haul flight after an energetic, exhausting but always rewarding, few weeks of social action.\n• Alexandra Burke – Hallelujah\nI think the lyrics to this song are amazing and the music incredible.\nBooks\nIn true Desert Island Discs style I was presented with the Complete Works of Shakespeare and a Bible and my own choice was Bess of Hardwick by Mary Lovell. When I have time to read anything other than Parliamentary papers – I enjoy Mary Lovell’s work. History, a bit of politics and insight into the life and times of some interesting individuals.\nLuxury Item\nI was invited to choose one luxury item which would not allow me to escape the island or communicate with others. Whilst I chose a Bottle of white wine to make the most of relaxing in the peaceful island surrounding, and quietly reading my book I discovered it was a forbidden item as it was viewed it could be used to send a rescue message in bottle! So in true style I opted for a box of wine instead!\nThank You\nI would like to thank the Reverend Mandy Walker for inviting me to take part in their own version of Desert Island Discs.

Whilst this was only partial suffrage, it was a huge victory and a first step that propelled the ongoing campaign and right for gender parity.\nMy Tea Party forms part of a year-long series of celebrations in both Parliament and across the country. As part of the celebrations earlier in the year there was an exhibition and a talk at Aldridge Library commemorating and celebrating the remarkable life of the ‘Aldridge Suffragette’. The story of Ellen Jones – our very own local suffragette – and the part she played in the campaign for universal suffrage was uncovered by our magnificent local historians Sue Satterthwaite and Len Boulton.\nAt my EqualiTeas event we were also able to reflect on the fact that so much has changed. As I illustrated it is hard for me to contemplate, whilst sitting on the green benches as a Member of the House of Commons, that 200-years ago, it was the loft space above the Chamber that was the only place reserved for women. Women were banned from the public galleries, they were forced out of sight, allowed only to watch and listen, but denied the right to contribute.\nWhilst we still have a long way to go we can at least boast 100-years on that our Head of State, Prime Minister and President of the Supreme Court are all female and now for the first time in its history Parliament has a female Black Rod.\nThank you to everyone who attended my Aldridge-Brownhills Tea Party.

As part of this I was pleased to lead the debate in Westminster Hall where the Government Minister was able to better understand the impact that these repeated incursions can have on so many residents. Westminster Hall debates are a very important way to raise local issues and receive a response from the Minister.\nAs a result of these debates the Government Minister has made clear his commitment to a call for evidence and a consultation on these matters, to consider the effectiveness of current legislation as well as suggestions for changes that will redress the balance and better serve our communities. This is a step forward and one which I welcome. Throughout this whole debate I have been clear, that with rights, must come responsibilities and with responsibilities must come respect.\nEarlier this month the Prime Minister, Theresa May renewed the Government’s commitment to the British Dream and to build a country where no one is left behind and where we will ensure that each new generation will be able to build a better future for themselves and their families. Central to achieving these objectives are plans to launch an independent review into the Mental Health Act, strengthen the Armed Forces covenant, invest an extra two billion pounds in building homes for younger families and introduce an energy cap to fix Britain’s broken energy market, bringing an end, once and for all, to rip off energy prices.\nAt home in the constituency it has once again been a busy few weeks.

However, there will be strict safeguards in place and specialist nurses will always discuss donation with families so an individual’s wishes are respected whilst also recognising the importance of those who want to be able to explicitly record a wish to opt out.\nI really welcome this decision as Organ donation saves lives. The proposed changes will help people who are waiting for a life-saving transplant, saving as many as 700 lives every year.",

Christmas is a good time to shop local but we should also remember the importance of shopping local all year round.\nAs someone who set up a small business I have always been proud as your Member of Parliament to champion our small businesses as well as ensuring they receive the support they need from the Government to be able to get on with the day job.\nIt was a pleasure to be able to see first-hand across the constituency all of the work which is on-going on a daily basis, so if you are a local business, please feel free to get in touch with your thoughts and ideas or if you would like me to visit your company to learn more about the work you are doing.",

It was an evening of music through the ages and everyone who attended thoroughly enjoyed the event. As we start to reflect ahead of Remembrance Sunday our thoughts will focus on the service and the sacrifice of both military and civilian personnel who gave their lives for our freedom.

A situation which continues to make the news here, and rightly so.\nWe cannot stand by, turn a blind eye and allow the use of these Chemical Weapons. It must be stopped and that is why the Prime Minister and the Government took the recent decision to launch a targeted attack on strategic sites known to have been used to make or store Chemical Weapons.\nThe use of Chemical Weapons in Syria, on the streets of the UK – as in Salisbury – or anywhere else, simply cannot, and should not, be tolerated. The lesson of history is that when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat we must take a stand and defend them.\nThis is what our country has always done, and as your Member of Parliament I will continue to do so and that is why I supported the Prime Minister in her actions.\nThe professionalism of our Armed Forces both at home and abroad once again is to be congratulated for the brave job they do to protect our nation. Closer to home and over the Easter recess it was a good opportunity to follow up on constituency work and local matters raised by Streetly residents. In recent weeks many of you have expressed to me your dissatisfaction at the impending closure by the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner of a series of Police Stations in and around our local area including Aldridge.\nI remain dismayed at the failure of the Police and Crime Commissioner to properly consult with us before rubbing stamping his decision to close our Police Station. I will continue to stand up for constituents and fight this, seeking reassurances that we will be fully consulted and listened to during the next steps. During the Easter recess I met with the Chief Superintendent of Walsall Neighbourhood Police Unit to further discuss this issue as well as bring to his attention a number of matters and concerns raised with me by residents from across Streetly. I also asked the Police to consider holding a series of local community reassurance events in the future.\nOn a lighter note, my Easter ended with Desert Island Discs – ‘Streetly Style’, at All Saints Parish Church to launch the ‘Friends of All Saints Church’.\nIn true Radio 4 style I picked my eight soundtracks, a book and a luxury item for my time as a ‘castaway’. In my interview with Streetly’s very own version of Kirsty Young in the form of Mike Garrett, I was put through my paces for 45-minutes as we strolled through my music and literary choices while discussing my background and career before politics as well as my role now as your Member of Parliament.\nI would like to thank the Reverend Mandy Walker and the Friends for inviting me to take part.

The theme for this year’s commemorations is ‘Be the light in the Darkness’, encouraging us all to reflect on the depths humanity can sink to, but also the ways that individuals and communities have resisted such darkness to ‘be the light’ before, during and after genocide. As the Holocaust moves from living history, to history, it becomes ever more important that we take the time to remember the six million Jewish victims and pay tribute to the survivors.\n*Photograph taken in 2020 before COVID 19 regulations came into place",

It is now unclear how events will unfold.\nMy position however remains clear. We have had a referendum, and as your Member of Parliament I will continue to respect that result and do all I can to deliver Brexit. I set out my position earlier this month by voting against a Second Referendum and against taking No Deal off the table. At the same time I also voted against extending article 50.\nI appreciate and accept that the Prime Minister’s Deal is a compromise and as such may not be what everyone wanted, but I firmly believe it remains the best way to leave in a quick and orderly way. Indeed, by backing this we could be out of the EU in less than 2 months. This is the way to deliver Brexit.\nWe must now be focussed on ensuring that Parliament does not unnecessarily extend the Brexit process, creating the very uncertainty my constituents and businesses wish to avoid. I do not want to see our country bounced in to a position where we will have to contest the forthcoming European Elections. Let us see how the week unfolds…\nOver the years Parliament has been witness to many significant and historic events, providing as it does a stability and continuity to our country and our democracy. One particular symbol of this is of course Big Ben, and the Elizabeth Tower.\nFor some time, due to the programme of repairs and conservation at Parliament we have been without the familiar background noise of Big Ben to guide our proceedings. Big Ben fell silent in August 2017 and with the exception of national events such as Remembrance Day, it will remain silent until 2021. I was however pleased to see the North Dial unveiled last week, in its original shade of blue, replacing the more familiar black colour scheme. It’s good to see that whilst the Brexit debate continues, Big Ben remains a welcome and reassuring sign of our democracy and our Parliament.\nTouching on local matters, since becoming your Member of Parliament I have always campaigned vigorously to protect our precious Greenbelt and open spaces.\nI am aware that there is a concern amongst residents in Streetly about the potential of development on the fields alongside Queslett Road East. Whilst there has been no formal planning application submitted to Walsall Council we must remain vigilant to any potential development.\nMy view remains that we need a ‘Brownfield first’ approach to housing and development and I continue to believe that this is the best approach. I will of course keep residents informed if I become aware of any further information.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 29th March 2019.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-column-10/content_845.html": "As I write this, the House is in Easter recess, which gives me time to spend meeting with constituents, catching up on casework, as well as visiting local schools, businesses and organisations.\nSince becoming your Member of Parliament almost two years ago I have been encouraged to see the way in which our local schools engage in democracy and citizenship. Some have visited the Houses of Parliament as part of the Education Service offered at Westminster, and just before recess I met teachers and children from Cooper Jordan School who were on a tour of Parliament.\nLast week though was a little different: Parliament came to Pelsall! To Ryder Hayes School – via the Parliament loan box. Designed to inspire debate, deepen understanding of democracy and provide an insight into the work of Parliament, the box included a division bell, speakers robe, a mace and even backdrops to recreate both chambers in the classroom. I was certainly impressed when I visited, not least by the wide range of questions from Year 5 who put me through my paces and quizzed me about my work as an MP and the workings of Parliament.\nEaster is a time of new life, warmth and colour after the darker days of winter, and a time of renewal and hope. For some, the bank holiday weekend will provide a welcome break and an opportunity to come together with family and friends, and within communities. At Westminster I recently attended a launch of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, in support of their work and to find out more about the practical steps that we can all take to tackle loneliness, particularly among older people. It has a slogan “start a conversation” to help encourage us all to talk to a friend or neighbour, visit or just make time for the people we meet. Sound words for us all, not just for politicians, as we go about our daily lives. This was reinforced perfectly when I called into the Community Café at Streetly All Saints Parish Church recently, and at the Easter coffee morning at St James’ Church in Brownhills. Different places, different occasions, but each with a common and very real sense of community that was reflected in their welcome.\nThere will be much going on in and around the constituency this Easter weekend, within our churches and across communities, including a gathering from the Historic Narrow Boats Club that will pass through Brownhills. Let me close by wishing you all a peaceful and Happy Easter.",

No one will ever forget her steadfast resolve and sense of duty to serve our country and the wider Commonwealth.\nChristmas is also a time to remember those who are elderly, unwell or alone at Christmas, and those less fortunate than ourselves: to acknowledge the service and dedication of our Armed Forces and the brave work of the men and women who work tirelessly to keep us safe and secure: and to recognise those who work around the clock, to provide life-saving healthcare, policing, fire and rescue, and emergency services for us all.\nThanks to the rollout of a world beating vaccination programme, this Christmas will be very different to the last two.

Meanwhile in the House of Lords or “Other Place” as it is known at Westminster, they continue to consider the EU Withdrawal Bill, making amendments that we in the House of Commons will look at and consider. With media outlets continuing to focus on the disagreements between the two Houses on this piece of legislation it is worth remembering that whilst scrutiny is an important part of the process, we must not lose sight of the result of the Referendum, which was to leave the EU, nor should the will of the House of Commons be undermined.\nBut, it’s not all just about Brexit. The Government remains focused on domestic matters and getting on with the day job of building a country that works for everyone.\nLast Friday was a sitting day in the House of Commons and I was pleased to be there to support my colleagues take forward the Parental Bereavement Bill. The majority of employers are very understanding about the need for leave at such a time, but, sadly, a small minority are not. This important Bill, which in recent months has shown Parliamentary debate at its best, will provide a statutory entitlement to two weeks leave.\nThe announcement of a further £50million of funding to expand the number of school places at existing good or outstanding selective schools is to be welcomed too. It will give more pupils from a wider range of backgrounds the opportunity to attend these schools and is another step forward. Whether looking at maintained schools, grammar or academies, it is right to keep our focus on raising standards and opportunities, and giving children the best start in life.\nIt is often easy to think of the House of Commons in terms of primary legislation debated on the green benches, however secondary legislation also passes through Parliament, albeit in a slightly different way. A good example of this was legislation recently passed by Committee to extend licensing hours to celebrate the Royal Wedding this weekend. Many of you will be participating in local celebrations, and I am sure you will join me in sending best wishes from Aldridge-Brownhills and Streetly to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\nIn other news, it was a pleasure to round off my week, back in Streetly, attending the “Sheep Sale” at All Saints Parish Church! It was lovely to see so many of Ewe there, and the wonderful hand-knitted sheep were sold in aid of Acorns Children’s Hospice. My new flock of three has headed to Westminster with me.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 18th May 2018.",

That is why I voted to trigger Article-50 and I voted for the European Union Withdrawal Bill, as part of the process of leaving the European Union.\nLast week I voted for the EU Withdrawal Agreement because I want to ensure the United Kingdom leaves the European Union at 11pm on 29th March 2019. I voted for the deal because it protects jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom, but most importantly because it delivers on our commitment to leave the European Union.\nThe 2016 referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy.\nFor over two years our Prime Minister has worked unceasingly to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union. Throughout that process she has treated the European Union with nothing but respect and although time is short, it is now beholden upon the European Union and all of us in Parliament to work together to find a way to deliver on the result of the Referendum.\nCloser to home and in Streetly we are fortunate to benefit from Sutton Park, which is an excellent local amenity. As constituents may be aware, Birmingham City Council is currently holding an informal consultation about the introduction of further car parking charges. I have reservations about these proposed changes and the impact they will have upon access to the Park for my constituents. I am also very disappointed to learn of the failure to consult Walsall Borough Council about the impact that these changes will have on residents, and residential streets, across Streetly.\nI have made representations to Birmingham City Council and I would encourage residents from across Streetly, who are affected, to do the same.\nMeanwhile my constituency highlights of 2019 have already begun with the opening night of Pantomime at Aldridge Youth Theatre. An evening of fun as they performed “Robinson Crusoe”, written by the ever entertaining Neville Ellis. With the Grunting Gorilla, Bonny from Bloxwich, and Brandy the Parrot to name but a few from the outstanding cast, everyone was superb. And let’s not forget the musicians and all those who worked in the background to make it yet another wonderful evening. Performances run until January 25th. It’s well worth a visit! Oh yes it is!\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 25 January 2019.",

We have now started to build on the decision to trigger Article 50 and the Government has formally laid before Parliament the European Union Withdrawal Bill. This legislation will facilitate our exit from the European Union and will begin paving the way for a ‘Global Britain’, where we will pass our own laws and govern ourselves and in which we will look beyond the continent of Europe and embrace the opportunities of the wider world. As we embark upon creating a new future we must now all work together to shape legislation.\nThe recent banning of unfair credit and debit cards fees is another piece of welcome news and from January will mean an end to those nasty surprises at the check-out just for using your card.\nAs the school academic year drew to a close I was very pleased by the announcement from the Education Secretary that schools are receiving an extra £1.3 billion in funding over the next two years which means no school will lose any funding. This provides certainty to our local schools and demonstrates the Government’s commitment to continue to raise standards.\nWith schools starting their annual summer break I am reminded that the holidays are a great opportunity for children to participate in the 2017 Summer Reading Challenge, a scheme I was delighted to support recently in Parliament. This year’s Summer Reading Challenge, run by the charity The Reading Agency, will engage with up to a million children across the country, encouraging them to borrow books, read and talk about their favourite stories and this year the theme is ‘Animal Agents’. Schemes such as this not only demonstrate the importance of reading but also remind us that local libraries remain a valuable asset for the benefit of the community, just like ours in Streetly. I have not yet decided upon my summer reading – all suggestions welcome!\nAcross the constituency I have also been kept busy, and as always it is a pleasure to be part of some of our many local events, including the annual Pelsall Carnival, the evening of music and singing from the Shelfield Male Voice Choir, and the Summer Fayre at the Hawthorns in Aldridge to mention just a few. Now in Recess, the business of Parliament takes a break, allowing me more time to catch up on constituency work and visits, and an opportunity to join you at more of your events which, as ever, I always look forward to.\nA version of this article was originally published in the Sutton Coldfield Observer 13th July.",

Age UK research shows that 1.2 million older people are chronically lonely, and half a million people over 60 usually spend every day alone, there is clearly a need for action.\nAlthough there is no quick fix or single policy solution to eradicate loneliness, there are reasons to hope that we can change things for the better. The Commission aims not to simply highlight the issue of loneliness, but more importantly act as a call to action. Under the slogan ‘start a conversation’, its goal is to mobilise us all to help our neighbours, family and friends – whether it be talking to a neighbour, visiting an old friend, or just making time for the people you meet.\nPeople can help by making time for older relatives and checking in on older friends and neighbours who they know. In addition, the organisations are asking their supporters and followers to post #happytochat on their Twitter and Facebook status to create online chatter around loneliness and encourage people across all generations to be aware of the loneliness that can often be found – but only behind closed doors.\nAnyone who wants to find out more about the Commission or how they can get involved in tackling loneliness in their community can visit www.jocoxloneliness.org for further information.",

Following pressure from Wendy Morton the Police and Crime Commissioner made a commitment to consult with residents about the future of policing in the local area and as yet Aldridge residents are still waiting.\nTime is moving on. As things currently stand Aldridge Police Station is due to close in a matter of only 9 months and we still appear to be no further forward in the identification of possible sites for a continued local police presence following a failure to consult with residents.\nI have written to the Police and Crime Commissioner repeatedly and I have offered Mr Jamieson several solutions to the situation. Including my latest proposal that given the central location of our current police station and its undoubted interest to developers, as part of site disposal, consideration should be given to a preferred developer who will provide a new, modern and fit for purpose station on the existing site as part of a new development.\nThis I believe, would fulfil everyone’s desire to maintain a local Police presence.\nResidents will remember that the decision to close the Police Station was sneaked out via a press release at the twelfth hour last spring. Following pressure it was agreed that there would be a consultation process and now 15-months later, the residents of Aldridge are still waiting.\nIt is now time for Police and Crime Commissioner to either engage with residents on a solution, accept my proposal or abandon his reckless plan.",

Irrespective of how you voted, I look forward to continuing to work with you, and representing Streetly in Parliament.\nI am also pleased to be continuing as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice having been first appointed by the Prime Minister earlier last year.\nImmediately after the General Election the Government hit the ground running laying out a new legislative programme through the Queen’s Speech and ensuring that we deliver on our central manifesto commitment to ‘Get Brexit Done’.\nDuring the first week back in January I was pleased to support the European Union Withdrawal Agreement Bill as it completed its Parliamentary stages in the House of Commons. It now passes to the House of Lords where I hope it continues to make good progress, allowing us to fulfil the mandate from the British people at the 2016 Referendum, and leave the European Union.\nBy completing the Brexit process, we can then start to concentrate on the domestic issues which matter to you and which were set out in the Queen’s Speech. These include introducing new laws to strengthen sentencing for the most serious violent offences, enshrining into law for the first time increases in NHS funding and ensuring that all of our children have access to a high quality education, whilst increasing levels of funding per pupil in every school.\nLocally, I will continue to campaign on the issues that matter to us here in Streetly and across the constituency, including protecting our precious Green Belt, campaigning to keep the Police Station in Aldridge, and seeking our fair share of the commitment to extra Police Officers.\nI could not finish however without a shout out for the Pantomime season.

Throughout a debate in Parliament, yesterday, I used the opportunity to reaffirm my assertion that the pendulum has swung too far away from local residents who have faced these repeated traveller incursions.\nWith a growing number of Unauthorised Encampments since the start of the year across the Walsall Borough it is absolutely understandable that local residents are at breaking point with what has become a merry-go-round of “Cat and Mouse”. When will it end we are left asking?\nResidents are tired of the anti-social behaviour, noise, rubbish and mess – which can be household, domestic and even human – that so often accompanies these incursions. The Council is left to clear up the mess – and the taxpayer to pick up the bill. Enough is enough.\nThe issues faced by the settled community when an Unauthorised Encampment arrives on your doorstep – as we have seen all too often across the Commons, Parks and Green Spaces of Aldridge-Brownhills – can be, and usually are, huge. It is not good enough for public bodies to gold-plate human rights and equalities legislation.\nI feel very strongly that Local Councils need to work closer with the Police and that the Government need to seek to understand whether existing legislation needs implementing more effectively, or needs strengthening. What more can be done – because as things are in Walsall we certainly feel the pendulum of balance has certainly swung away from local residents.\nThe issues of Unauthorised Traveller Encampments and the detrimental effects it is having on our local communities will also be debated in Westminster Hall on Thursday 12 October in a debate that I am leading and will be reporting back to residents about.",

At its heart the bill is about enabling journalists and local people to better hold their local authority to account for their spending decisions.

This means the Bill passes in to law and the Government can now trigger Article 50 as planned, by the end of March.\nI also welcomed a visit to Westminster last week from Aldridge based In-Comm Training and a group of their fantastic apprentices, and local employers, to celebrate apprenticeships and highlight the importance of technical education and training to boost economic productivity and develop vital skills both for today and the future. As we seek to make a success of Brexit for our country and for the West Midlands, and make the most of new trade opportunities, investing in skills and apprenticeships is key to ensuring we have a workforce fit and ready for the future. In the last Parliament 2.4 million apprenticeships were created and in this one we are looking to deliver 3 million by 2020. The Government is determined to build further on the success of the apprentice revolution and reforms to core skills by pioneering the T-Level, a technical education system focussing on technical system.\nThere was also some particularly welcome transport news with the Government announcing that more than one million pounds is to be invested in improving the junction of the A5 and Chase Road/A5195 in Brownhills. Highways England will now be undertaking further analysis of the proposals in coming months, and knowing just how frustrating it is to sit in the traffic at this junction this will make a positive and welcome difference.\nMeanwhile, back in the constituency and knowing of some local concerns I was particularly encouraged to hear of the “Beat the Burglar” event organised by Walsall Police: an excellent initiative last Friday which included pop up stalls in Aldridge, Brownhills, Pelsall and Streetly providing an opportunity to meet neighbourhood officers, seek advice and and learn about crime prevention.

A strengthening of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to permit the Police greater powers to remove an Unauthorised Traveller Encampment will be welcomed by Neighbourhood Watch groups across Aldridge-Brownhills.\nI have repeatedly raised this issue in Parliament because of concerns raised by my constituents who have faced repeated incursions and who now want to see the balance redressed and fairness put back into our communities. I believe there is now the will to strengthen the law and redress that balance and I will continue to keep you informed about this important matter.\nI was pleased at the beginning of February to spend the afternoon out and about in the community with our fantastic local Police Officers. It was a great opportunity for me to see first-hand how they are tackling crime both in a proactive and reactive way. It also gave me an informative insight in to the various jobs our hardworking local policing team undertake on the front line day and night, to keep us safe locally.\nWhilst there is still no further news regarding the Aldridge police station closure, I am remain committed to ensuring that the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner involves local residents in this process and I will continue to press for a timetable to be published.

After a busy Friday in the constituency I returned to Westminster to support the Prime Minister and back his deal.\nIt was therefore very disappointing that the House of Commons voted to accept an amendment to the Prime Minister’s deal, causing more delay and uncertainty. I voted against this amendment, as I want to ensure we leave the European Union on 31st October 2019 – but instead, Parliament sought to bind the Prime Minister’s hands.\nIt is my responsibility to honour the result of the 2016 EU Referendum and deliver on its outcome. It was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done by 31 October. However, it’s not all about Brexit! I continue to campaign on the issues which matter to you, including the over development of our local area and the demolition of the Perry Barr Flyover.\nI was therefore extremely disappointed that Birmingham City Council have decided to plough ahead regardless with their reckless plan to demolish the flyover, in spite of the concerns expressed by more than 10,000 local residents.\nThe decision taken by Birmingham City Council will be detrimental to a large number of residents across Streetly, and shows a blatant disregard for their own technical report which highlights that their proposal to remove the flyover would actually make traffic flow worse! Not to mention the disruption it is going to cause! I have always believed that the Commonwealth Games should leave a lasting legacy for our region, but sadly the decision taken by Birmingham City Council will only leave a lasting headache for a large number of residents across Streetly. I urge the Council to reconsider their decision.\nHowever, I am pleased to note that Walsall Council’s Planning Department have rejected a planning application for a 60-bed care home on Thornhill Road which would have dramatically changed the street scene, detrimentally affecting the character of the local area.\nFollowing my meeting with local residents I was pleased to add my support to their campaign to have this development stopped. I believe that all new development should be sensitive to the character of our local area and should meet the needs of Streetly residents and not simply work in the interests of developers.

In/Out, Remain/Brexit, the debate and commentary will continue to polling day. Of that at least we can be certain! This will be an historic vote, a chance for us all to have our say at the ballot box, a chance we have been given thanks only to this Government. I hear from those who have already decided which way to vote, and those wanting more information. It has long been my view that it’s time for us to have our say, but it is equally important that both sides of the argument are heard and, for those wanting to know more, to reach an informed decision. I expect leaflets through our letterboxes from both campaigns, but in the meantime, I thought it may be helpful to share with you the details of an on-line information hub set up by the House of Commons Library where you can find all the research documents it has produced on issues relating to the Referendum debate. You can visit the on-line blog at http://www.parliament.uk/eu-referendum.\nLast weekend was Rotary Health Awareness Day in Aldridge. When I popped by to chat with fellow Rotarians, a steady stream of people had called in for a free blood pressure check and blood sugar test. I duly had mine tested and was declared ‘normal’! Initiatives like this are an excellent way of raising awareness and we must thank Aldridge Rotary Club and all those who volunteered on the day to organise this event.\nRaising awareness of health issues is important to us all. This week is Dementia Awareness Week 2016, led by Alzheimer’s Society, an organisation I have worked with in the past, and which I hope to do so again.\nDementia costs the UK a staggering £23 billion a year, which is more than the cost of cancer, heart disease or stroke. It is worrying that the diagnosis rate has been historically low, and therefore I welcome the Government’s objective and work they are doing to be a world leader in fighting dementia and their commitment to improve diagnosis, care support and research. As vital research continues, the condition does not go away, and we must recognise the impact that dementia often has on families and carers. It can be very difficult to look after someone who has dementia, especially in the early stages before they are diagnosed. The challenge of helping people to live with the condition has to be met in part by the community too. I would therefore urge anyone who has the chance to take the short course and become a Dementia Friend to do so. Like me you will gain more awareness and a vital understanding of how to help in small practical ways.",

Experienced predominantly, but not exclusively, by women, we know that there are men who suffer too, there are children who witness it and remain at risk, and concerned families, friends and neighbours who are affected. It has no geographic or demographic boundaries and can go undetected and undisclosed for many years.\nIndeed, there was a time, not too long ago, when violence in the family home was simply dismissed as being “just a domestic”. We have moved on from that, but we need to go further.\nThat is why during my time as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice I was pleased to be able to work on the Domestic Abuse Bill, a landmark piece of legislation that this Government remains committed to reintroducing to Parliament.\nThe Domestic Abuse Bill will raise awareness and understanding about the devastating impact of domestic abuse on victims and their families. It will also help transform our response as a society, helping to prevent offending, protect victims and support their families to ensure they have the support they need.\nOne of the most significant measures in the Bill is the introduction of a legal definition of domestic abuse, and with this the recognition that abuse can take many forms, including economic abuse and coercive control. It will also establish a new Domestic Abuse Commissioner to be a voice for victims.\nSupport for victims and their families remains central to tackling Domestic Abuse and I was fortunate to be able to visit Black Country Women’s Aid and learn at first hand more about the tremendous work they do. Their dedicated and experienced team provide vital and much needed support.\nWith an estimated 2 million adults experiencing domestic abuse in the year ending March 2018 the Bill provides a clear and much needed commitment to shine a light on domestic abuse. We owe it to all those millions of people who suffer in silence to do something about it, and to do it now.\nIn last week’s much anticipated and talked about reshuffle, the Prime Minister appointed me as a Minister at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, a position I was incredibly honoured, humbled and very happy to accept.\nMy new role at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will bring new challenges as we shape Government policy following our departure from the European Union, but the most important thing to remember is that nothing changes locally. Rest assured, it does not diminish my commitment to Aldridge-Brownhills and I remain your Member of Parliament and will continue to make your views heard at Westminster.\nThis article was first published in the Royal Sutton Observer on Friday 28th February 2020",

The competition asked schools to design a plaque for a tree to celebrate either the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy, our environment or our local area.\nI was delighted to receive more than 80 entries from local schools and I invited West Midlands Lord-Lieutenant John Crabtree OBE along with the Mayor and Mayoress of Walsall, Councillor Marco and Mrs Andrea Longhi, to assist with the judging. It was not an easy task!\nThere was extremely strong competition amongst all of the entrants with a magnificent range of creative and imaginative drawings covering a wide range of themes dedicated to saving our planet and protecting our natural environment.\nAs well as the winning school receiving the Commonwealth Tree, their design will be transformed into a special greetings card that will be sent to HM The Queen to celebrate the importance of her Commonwealth Canopy Initiative.\nI would like to thank everyone who submitted an entry to my competition.",

So it was good to be at their Christmas Concert on Saturday evening and to once again be roped in to participate – this time assisting with conducting the Schneewalzer! The Staffordshire Band are planning a number of events next year, including several at St John’s Church in Walsall Wood.

I was absolutely delighted and have now joined the Whips’ office, where I will be helping to deliver the Government’s legislative agenda in the House of Commons. It is a huge honour and privilege and, as I am discovering, there is much to learn, not least the history and the role of the Whip, something I will be sharing with you in future weeks.\nThe New Year also brought with it the final stages of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill in the House of Commons and I am pleased it has passed thus far, ensuring we honour the outcome of the Referendum to leave the European Union. The Bill now passes to the House of Lords where we look to their Lordships to respect the will of the elected House of Commons to ensure that we have an orderly exit from the European Union.\nFrom correspondence and emails I receive, I know just how much locally, and as a nation, we care about animal welfare and our environment. I was therefore pleased to see the Government developing environmental policy as part of our preparations for Brexit. The Prime Minister’s 25-year Environment Plan is about making sure that we take steps towards ensuring that we have a Cleaner and Greener Britain and her vision demonstrates how in a post Brexit Britain we will be able to aim higher and achieve more in key areas of national policy such as the environment.\nAt both Government level, and as individuals, I believe we have a responsibility to leave our planet in a better state for the next generation, with cleaner air, stronger protections for animal welfare and greener spaces. That’s why I welcome Government plans that include banning microbeads to protect our marine life and looking at measures to reduce single use plastic, as well as passing legislation to ensure that animal abusers are jailed for up to 5-years.\nAcross the constituency, I see the pride that is taken in our local communities and the time and effort made to protect our environment. The many individuals and teams of volunteers who care for our parks, commons and open spaces are to be congratulated for their dedication and in March many may well be helping with the Great British Spring Clean. This initiative is being organised by Keep Britain Tidy and is seeking to inspire 500,000 people nationwide to get outdoors, get active and help clear the rubbish that blights our local communities. I am looking forward to being part of this initiative too.\nBut I can’t finish without mentioning the fabulous last night performance of Humpty Dumpty at Aldridge Youth Theatre last weekend. Once again we were superbly entertained with some good pantomime fun, written by the talented Neville Ellis and superbly directed by Alex Fisher. Every pantomime needs a dame and we were certainly not disappointed by the colourful Betsy Bannock the palace nanny. Together with a boy called Humphrey Dumfrey from Walsall, Private Trott, Captain Cantor and Sergeant Gallop the Kings Men, and Horace the Kings Horse, it was a splendid evening. As the curtain fell I was only left wondering what next year’s performance will bring. Well done everyone.\nThis was first published by the Walsall Advertiser and the Sutton Observer on 5 February 2018.",

The company, which employs over 300 apprentices, saw Matthew Lowe, who lives in my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency amongst the finalists of their national awards.\nI was pleased to be able to join Matthew at the awards ceremony and add my congratulations to him and all of our other fantastic apprentices who make such a magnificent contribution.\nOnce again it was good to see a local apprentice amongst the handful of national finalists. I was hugely impressed by the real passion and energy that Matthew showed for his role and I wish him continued success in the future. I am a firm believer in the value of apprenticeships and it is good to see companies such as Veolia see the value and benefit they bring to their business.\nApprentices and graduates alike are an integral part of skills development and innovation and are vital in helping us resolve the UK’s skills gap, whilst also providing career opportunities for people of all ages and increasing economic productivity.

However, in technical education we have fallen behind other leading nations, with too many students, parents and employers seeing Further Education as the second best option.\nThat is why I welcomed the Augar Review and its wide-ranging examination of post-18 educational opportunities. Further Education Colleges are vital to provide training for future generations, to be able to help drive economic prosperity and deliver the Modern Industrial Strategy which is central to our ambition in the West Midlands.\nI believe passionately that we have to give more young people a genuine choice about their education. We have seen the expansion of more high quality apprenticeships, delivered new technical qualifications on a par with A’ Levels and now I believe its right to reform Further Education.\nIt’s not enough to simply say that Further Education and Higher Education should be seen as equal, we need to take some action to ensure it happens and that is why I welcome this review.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-column/content_430.html": "The first week back in Parliament after the summer recess provided the most intense series of debates I have experienced so far. Three debates on the Syrian refugee and migrant crisis and a Private Members Bill on assisted dying. Transcending party politics, Parliament is at its best when debating the moral and ethical matters of the day.\nIn 2013 I travelled to Turkey and visited one of the camps on the Syrian border. It was home to 17,000 Syrians, and even at that time it was a fraction of the total number who had fled, or who had been displaced within Syria by the brutal civil war. Current figures show there are 16.2million people in need of humanitarian aid, 12.2mn of whom are in Syria, and 4mn in the surrounding area.\nWe are a compassionate nation and we should continue to play our part to help. Britain has sent the Royal Navy to help save lives in the Mediterranean. We are the second biggest bilateral donor in the world to Syria and have contributed considerably more than any other country in the EU, including food, water and medical care. Providing humanitarian aid in and around Syria where it is needed is the right thing to do. Last week the Prime Minister announced that Britain would settle 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years.\nWe are also a just nation. We should not submit to terror and we should discourage people trafficking. It is vital that we are able to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants, and that we work to secure long term stability.\nParliament’s debate on Assisted Dying Bill was an emotional and impassioned one. Some members elicited interventions whilst others induced silence. Whichever view you hold this important subject was debated to its fullest extent leaving many enthralled by this moral debate.\nA large number of constituents have contacted me to express their views, often taking the time to share their own personal stories on the rightness or wrongness of the Bill and I am grateful to you all for this. I listened to the debate, and considered the most profound and emotive issues, but in my head and my heart could not support it. What was being proposed raised more questions than it answered.\nI believe we should be helping people, not assisting in suicide, providing more focus on improved palliative care. This was brought home to me again when I joined several hundred ladies on the starlight walk in Aldridge to raise funds for St Giles Hospice in Walsall. Community care needs a caring community and I believe we have this in Aldridge –Brownhills.\nA version of this article was originally published in the Walsall Advertiser and Sutton Coldfield Observer on September 17th.",

Of course, we also had a statement following the Court decision regarding triggering Article 50. I am in no doubt though, that the Prime Minister means what she says – that Brexit means Brexit. The country voted to leave the EU and that’s what we must do. Infact it would surely create a worrying precedent if the result of a referendum were to be ignored or blocked by Parliament.\nWe had the news last week that inflation is down again to .09% in the year to October, a further fall from September when it was 1.0%. Together with news that the unemployment figure has dropped to an 11 year low, both are to be welcomed and are in advance of the Autumn Statement when all eyes are on the Chancellor as he delivers his first statement, and the first major financial statement since the EU Referendum. As many of you will know, the Autumn Statement is one of two statements the Treasury makes each year to Parliament and it focuses on economic growth and government finances as projected by the office of budget responsibility (OBR). Writing this in advance of being in the House of Commons Chamber to listen to the Chancellor, I too, wait to hear what will be in the Autumn Statement and what it will mean for my constituents.\nWith budgets in mind I have received correspondence from a number of residents concerning budget proposals locally from Walsall Council. Whilst it is for Walsall Council to make proposals and then decisions, and like government, local councils are sometimes faced with choices and difficult decisions, this is where consultation and listening to the views and opinions of residents is vital and I would urge you to take part in the process and let the council know your views and know what services matter to you.\nI was recently invited to join a meeting of residents in Streetly who are campaigning to keep their library open, as indeed are others across the constituency. Libraries are about so much more than just books, and that’s why I have raised the issue of library closures in the House of Commons with the Leader of the House.\nBack home from Westminster and school visits are a frequent and important part of my constituency work. A chance to discuss educational matters with staff and governors, and a chance to talk to students and answer questions, and my recent visit to Brownhills School was particularly memorable. It was Armistice Day, and on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month, students, staff and visitors came together in silence for a poignant ceremony to mark the moment in 1918 when the guns fell silent. I felt honoured to be a part of this act of remembrance",
  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_securing-the-next-stage-of-our-nhs-future/content_515.html": "As the NHS approaches it’s 70th Birthday, the announcement last week by the Prime Minister of her plans to secure the future of the NHS by bringing forward a long-term plan and a 5-year funding settlement, is both very welcome and timely. This is an historic opportunity and one to engage all of us as users of the NHS to ensure current and future generations are able to access the care they need. Like you, my family and I have always relied on the NHS and I want to see us continue to preserve the value of fairness on which it was founded, whilst building the NHS of the future, ensuring it is there for future generations, just as it has been in the past.\nUnder the Government’s plan, NHS funding will grow year on year and by 2023-24 the NHS England budget will increase by £20.5 billion in real terms compared with today. That means there will be £394 million a week additional resource in real terms supporting our precious NHS and meeting the growing patient demand.\nIn what has been a very hectic week in Parliament, and after what is known in Westminster as “Ping-Pong” – when legislation is passed back and forth between the House of Lords and the House of Commons until agreement is finally reached – I am very pleased that the EU (Withdrawal) Bill was finally, and successfully, concluded. This marks a crucial step in our preparations for leaving the European Union and is one of the most significant pieces of legislation, following the resultof the Referendum. It provides greater certainty and allows us to begin paving the vitally important way for a ‘Global Britain’ where we will be able to look beyond the continent of Europe and begin to embrace the opportunities of the wider world with new friends and old allies alike.\nBack home, and as part of the celebrations to mark the 100th Anniversary of the Representation of the People’s Act 1918 I was delighted to welcome people from across the constituency to my EqualiTeas Tea Party.\nThis was an opportunity for us locally to celebrate this landmark moment in our country’s history when women over 30 and all men over 21 got the vote, and I would like to thank everyone who was able to attend and make it such a special occasion.\nA huge thank you must however also go to the Streetly Community Association for organizing the recent Streetly Festival. We had a lovely afternoon, enjoying the music and chatting to lots of people. Well done to you all.\nFinally, as we approach the weekend and celebrate Armed Forces Day on June 30th, let us be reminded that their sense of duty and professionalism is an example to us all.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 29th June 2018",

For 19 consecutive months wages have risen faster, meaning families have greater financial security and can plan with greater confidence.\nThis is against a backdrop of record high employment, with unemployment rates across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency consistently falling and currently 43% lower than in 2010.\nAll of these figures are encouraging and they show that the British economy is fundamentally strong enabling us as a Government to invest in your priorities – frontline funding for our hospitals and schools and 20,000 more police officers on our streets. The hard work to rebuild our economy has also meant that we have been able to continue cutting taxes by increasing personal allowances to £12,500 per year, whilst we are planning to increase the National Living Wage to £10.50 per hour.",

At the end of last year the WMCA launched an important two-stage consultation on proposals to merge the Police and Crime Commissioner and Mayoral roles. Combining the role of Mayor and Police and Crime Commissioner, such as in London and Manchester, has been planned for a while and will ensure that there is greater accountability for residents locally.\nThe first stage of the consultation closed on January 11th and focused on whether or not people supported the principle of transferring the powers from the Police and Crime Commissioner to the Mayor of the West Midlands. The second stage of the consultation focuses on the proposed detail of how the strategic leadership and governance of policing would operate within the West Midlands Region and who would be responsible for making decisions. This element of the consultation is open until 11th March 2019 and I would encourage you to make your views known by responding via the West Midlands Combined Authority website www.wmca.org.uk.\nWith no further news regarding the police station closure, I am continuing to press for us to be involved in the process and for a timetable to be published.

However, as your Member of Parliament there are many other issues I am also working on. One area I wanted to update you on in particular, is my involvement in the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme (AFPS).\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, I chose the Royal Navy for my first year of the scheme, as my husband was a Navy Man in his early career. Enthused by the scheme I have subsequently spent a further year on the RAF programme and now my third year is being spent with the Army.\nThe programme gives MP’s direct experience of the Armed Forces and aims to help improve understanding and debate on military issues in Parliament. We are expected to complete a minimum of 15-days over the course of the year. This includes an Introduction Course at the UK Defence Academy, plus visits to bases, where we meet with personnel, from new recruits to senior officers. Last week I was in Catterick Garrison and Harrogate but I have also been fortunate to spend time in the Arctic region of Norway to meet Royal Marines.\nOur Armed Forces do a tremendous job from keeping us safe, to assisting with humanitarian operations. Their sense of duty and their professionalism is an example to us all. Through the AFPS I have been able to gain a better understanding of what life in the services is really like and this has already helped me with my work in Parliament.\nCloser to home and in the constituency, we have many links to the Armed Forces both past and present. From Gus Bonner awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery, through to the tremendous work of the Aldridge Great War Project which is helping us all to learn more about our local history, and not forgetting our excellent Cadet Units who provided terrific support at the recent Remembrance Day services.\nIn other news my work as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State at the Department for International Development continues following the recent appointment of Penny Mordant MP, herself a Royal Navy Reservist. This is an area of interest which I developed over many years before becoming a Member of Parliament and I am pleased to be able to support the new Secretary of State in her role.\nIn closing, we are approaching the start of Advent and the many activities and events that mark the run up to Christmas. I look forward to being out and about and once again meeting many of you.\nThis was first published by the Walsall Advertiser and the Sutton Observer on 1 December 2017.",

Small businesses are the backbone of our local economy, and I have always been proud as your Member of Parliament to champion our small businesses and to push to see that they receive the support they need from the Government to be able to get on with the day job. That’s why I am pleased to see the Government announced a further £200 million to support British businesses.\nThe Government’s Modern Industrial Strategy demonstrates commitment to supporting small business and helping them to succeed, and this new funding which is being made available through the British Business Bank will provide loans to small companies looking to increase in size.\nWe should not forget that as a country we are creating more start-up businesses than any other European country, and this additional funding will help ensure our small businesses and entrepreneurs can thrive and make Britain the best place in the world to do business.",

The Chamber was jam-packed with MPs from both sides of the House, eager to hear what the Chancellor had to say.\nConsidering the unfolding financial situation in Greece, it is important, now more than ever, that we sort out our finances and put our own house in order, and that means sticking to a careful and sensible economic plan.\nThe budget’s focus was on security: the economic security of a country that lives within its means, the financial security of lower taxes and a new National Living Wage, and the national security of a country that defends itself and its values.\nIt is a budget that keeps us moving from a low wage, high tax, high welfare economy to higher wages, lower tax and lower welfare. An increase in the tax threshold will mean we can earn more before we start to pay tax and will help those on low incomes. Changes to inheritance tax will support saving and aspiration by raising the effective threshold for most couples to £1million, and the announcement that fuel duty is to remain frozen this year will be welcome news to motorists.\nAs a new MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Armed Forces Group I am very aware that the first duty of Government is to protect its citizens and I was pleased to hear that the budget included a commitment to meet NATO’s 2% target for defence spending, not just for this year but for every year of this decade.\nToday’s world is uncertain and insecure, and it is crucial that we are prepared for any challenges that may lie ahead. This applies to defence as well as to our finances – the need for security in all matters is vital and that is why I am glad this was recognized in the budget.\nReturning to Aldridge after a busy week in Parliament it was a real pleasure to join the Air Cadets from 1444 (Brownhills) Squadron at their Annual Dining-In. It was an evening to celebrate the successes of the Squadron and, being the week of the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain, a reminder of the brave men and women who serve our country, and those who aspire to follow in their footsteps, keeping us all safe and secure.\nA version of this article was originally published in the Walsall Advertiser and Sutton Coldfield Observer on July 16.",

I enjoyed being ‘put through my paces’ and the thought provoking discussions which followed, and am already looking forward to the next time.\nSaturday morning and it was the 2015 Poppy Run for the Aldridge British Legion, and not even the cold damp start to the day could put a stop to the runners as they sped through to the finish line. I had the privilege to join organisers Karen Waple and Harry Fry at the finishing line to present the medals and trophies.\nIt was then on to my first “Christmas” event of the year – the Rushall Christmas Lights Fayre at the community centre where everyone was working hard to raise funds for the Christmas tree. A good cup of a coffee, the chance to buy some homemade cakes and an opportunity to chat. It was a good way to round off the morning. I can’t wait to see the tree when it’s put up nearer Christmas.\nNext stop, Pelsall and the unveiling of a new ambulance for the Pelsall Disabled Group.

These refusals have a significant negative impact on the confidence, independence and wellbeing of people who have guide dogs.\nGuide Dogs’ launched their Open Doors campaign which aims to raise awareness of the rights assistance dog owners have, and the need for better enforcement and clearer laws.\nAt the event I met guide dog owners who told me their experiences of being illegally turned away because they had their guide dog with them.\nGuide dog owners have the right to live their lives the way they want and feel confident, independent, and supported in the world. The law is clear, and yet guide dog owners continue to experience access refusals, which are almost always illegal.\nI would like to see the law strengthened on access rights for assistance dogs, to prevent access refusals and to open doors for guide dogs. |",

It uses the Commonwealth network to share knowledge and best practice for forest conservation, whilst creating a physical and lasting legacy of The Queen’s leadership of the Commonwealth.\nThe Queen’s initiative came to prominence in April when ITV screened a landmark documentary. At the heart of the film was a conversation between the Queen and Sir David Attenborough filmed in the gardens of Buckingham Palace. The documentary was a rare opportunity to see the Queen talking informally to Sir David, the conversation ranged from climate change, to conkers and trees.\nFollowing the documentary and in conjunction with the Woodland Trust I launched an ideas competition for primary school children from across my constituency. All participants were asked to design a plaque dedicated to the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy.\nI was delighted to receive more than 70 entries, and very impressed by the range of wonderful ideas and designs showing how we protect our local environment, promote the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy initiative and combat the growing threat of climate change.\nThe entries were outstanding and the Lord Lieutenant of the West Midlands, the Mayor and Mayoress of Walsall and I had an extremely difficult task in selecting one overall winner.\nElizabeth’s winning design encapsulated the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy initiative, our environment and the need to build bridges with partners across the globe to take steps to save our planet for future generations.\nThe inspirational design by Elizabeth has been transformed into a greetings card which will be sent to Her Majesty the Queen to highlight the importance of her Commonwealth Canopy Initiative.

This is equivalent to almost 54 per month.\nIt was helpful to hear from the Minister and to understand that the Government recognises the real concern about losing access to bank branches, but we also discussed the need for greater clarity and speed in rolling out community banking hubs, the role of the Post Office, and the need for a modern, flexible banking system that meets the needs of customers, businesses, local charities and organisations alike.

That means there will be £394 million a week additional resource in real terms supporting our precious NHS.\nAs part of our long-term plan for the NHS, the Government has also announced that doctors and nurses are to be excluded from the cap on skilled worker visas and combined with the expansion of training places up to 2020 it will mean greater numbers of doctors and nurses to provide outstanding patient care.\nThe 70th anniversary of the NHS, the announcement of a new funding settlement, a long-term plan, and the publication of a social care Green Paper create an historic opportunity to engage all of us as users of the NHS to ensure that current and future generations are able to access the care they need.\nThe Government are focussed on ensuring that we create a Britain that works for everyone.

The Holocaust reshaped our understanding of global responsibility, the meaning of human rights and fundamentally altered our view of democracy.\nHolocaust Educational Trust works hard to recognise survivors and their families who continue to work tirelessly to educate young people on this part of global history. The Holocaust became part of the English National Curriculum in 1991 and has remained there ever since. It is the only historical event that has remained a compulsory part of the curriculum since its inception and I feel it is important that this continues to be taught in our schools.\nThis year, as I sign the book once again, I would like to pay tribute to the millions of people whose lives were changed by the Holocaust.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_delivering-on-the-issues-which-matter-to-you/content_738.html": "| Out and about across my Constituency this summer it has been good to listen to constituents share their views. Brexit and the need to get it done is a top priority and it is mine too. Since becoming Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made clear his commitment to ensuring we leave the European Union on 31st October and honour the outcome of the 2016 EU Referendum. However, our new Prime Minister also understands and has demonstrated, that it is not just about Brexit. Having seen the largest cash injection to the NHS back in April and the welcome commitment of £36 million to construct a new A&E at the Manor Hospital, it is good to see Boris has followed this with a further £850 million for hospital upgrades across the country, including £97.1 million for upgrade work at University Hospitals Birmingham. This is good news for us here in the West Midlands. In addition, the Prime Minister has acknowledged the importance of law and order, with a commitment to 20,000 new police officers to help patrol our streets and make our communities safer. This has been further backed up with 10,000 new prison places, building new modern, efficient prisons providing better opportunities for rehabilitation. I am pleased that the new Government has made an important start on addressing issues that matter to us, but there is a lot of work still to do. Locally, I recently announced that I was working with the West Midlands Mayor Andy Street on a survey across Streetly and Aldridge to protect our precious Green Belt and open spaces against development proposals being considered as part of the Black Country Core Strategy. It is a major exercise and involves delivering personalised letters to local residents. The delivery is continuing, but I am pleased to report that already we have had literally thousands of responses in support of protecting our Green Belt. Once we have completed the delivery of the survey, Andy and I will be in a stronger position to make the case to Walsall Council to ensure continued protection of our Green Belt. I would like to thank everyone who has so far returned the survey form. Looking ahead and on Friday 6th September I will be holding my first Seniors’ Fair at Aldridge Community Centre, between 10am and 1pm, when I will be opening the doors to organisations, community groups, advice services and charities tailored to those who are seeking to retire, or who are already retired. The aim of the event is to introduce you to support, voluntary and active services as well as a range of organisations that are on offer in our local area. TheSeniors’ Fair is a free event so why not take the opportunity to come along, enjoy a free cup of tea or coffee, perhaps meet new people and pick up some information.

Many of us will know of the incredible work of Marie Curie, yet currently one in four people don’t get the care and support they need at the end of life.\nThe money raised through the appeal helps Marie Curie provide expert care and support to anyone with an illness they are likely to die from, and support those close to them, either through one of the charity’s hospices, hospice care at home services, or free Information and Support line which provides practical and emotional support on any aspect of death, dying and bereavement.\nI recently met one of the Marie Curie Healthcare Assistants, and Marie Curie Ambassador Chris Kamara in Parliament to show my support for this year’s appeal.",

As a government we will expand the supply side of the economy through tax cuts and reform, tackle the immediate energy crisis, remove barriers for business and build the infrastructure that we need to grow the British economy.\nOur Growth Plan delivers the biggest set of tax cuts in 50 years. High taxes damage Britain’s competitiveness and reduce incentives to work. That is why we are bringing forward the 1 percentage point cut to the Basic Rate of Income Tax to April 2023 and reversing the increase in National Insurance Contributions.\nWe are also doubling the level at which Stamp Duty is paid from £125,000 to £250,000, and expanding First Time Buyers’ Relief, by increasing the level at which first-time buyers start paying Stamp Duty from £300,000 to £425,000.\nWe will publish a list of infrastructure projects that will be accelerated, complemented by a renewed focus to speed up projects through new legislation. This will streamline the complex patchwork of restrictions and EU-derived laws which have held Britain back over decades.\nPutin’s weaponisation of gas prices is the biggest drag on growth in the short-term. The government acted at the start of September to announce the Energy Price Guarantee, to ensure that a typical household in Great Britain pays an average £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years, from 1 October 2022.\nWe promised we would cut taxes and we have with lower rates of business and personal tax.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_removing-the-cap-on-charity-lotteries-fundraising/content_286.html": "I recently led a Westminster Hall debate on removing the cap on charity lotteries fundraising.\nCharity lotteries, or social lotteries, as they are more formally known, generate over £400 million a year for charities and good causes the length and breadth of Great Britain, meaning they constitute a significant funding stream for many well known charities and local community groups alike.\nI was therefore pleased to highlight the projects across my own Aldridge-Brownhills constituency which have received funding – including the Canal & River Trust, which has restored the Black Cock Bridge; the Royal Voluntary Service, which operates locally from Brownhills Memorial Hall; and Manor Farm Community Association, which was awarded funding for the Silver Connections outreach programme for the elderly.\nHowever, it is also the case that a charity lottery is restricted to how much they can raise each year as they subject to heavy bureaucratic burdens.\nThis means that millions in potential funding is needlessly being lost and is being felt by organisations such as Girlguiding, Keep Britain Tidy, and Young Lives vs Cancer.\nWith cross-party support, I will continue to urge the Government to remove this limit and allow charity lotteries to better support those in need, without cost to the Treasury or taxpayer.",

Each time leaving in its wake a trail of litter, rubbish, dog fouling and human waste to be cleared, as well as flytipping to be removed, and the site to be secured.\nOne Friday evening after my surgery, I met with dozens of local residents to listen to their frustrations and concerns that the current system leaves them feeling helpless, and that despite the best efforts of the local Councillors and Council the process is simply leading to a game of ‘Cat and Mouse’ which is not fair on those cleaning up the mess, nor the taxpayers who ultimately pay for it.\nWhilst acknowledging how the relationship between travellers and the settled community has changed over the years, it’s time to look again at the law, and seek sensible but sensitive approaches for changes to be made.\nThese illegal encampments frequently arrive on weekends and evenings, and move on just before a court order is about to be enforced. Local Authorities and the Police need additional powers and responsibilities to help move unauthorised encampments more quickly and out of hours services to deal with issues that arise at weekends. It is time to review the welfare checks process too, so that when moved within a local authority area, authorities do not have to undertake the same checks on the same people, every time.\nOn a separate note, on July 16 the Department for Culture Media and Sport launched its public consultation as part of the charter review for the BBC. This occurs every 10 years with the current charter expiring at the end of 2016.\nThe review is designed to ensure that the BBC – its funding and output – remains relevant and up to date. There has been much discussion in the media about the future of the television license. The number of households without a television is growing. Many people now access programmes through BBC ‘catch up’ on iPlayer where there is no requirement to pay a fee or have a licence.\nThe funding of a Public Service broadcaster and the programmes it provides in this digital age are now to be decided. It is a service for all of us as members of the public and it is right that we should all have the opportunity to have our say on its future. The Government’s consultation is open and can be found here.\nThe consultation closes on the October 8 and I would urge everyone to take part as this review will set the future of the BBC not only for the next ten years but will also decide its direction in a swiftly changing world of electronic media.\nA version of this article was originally published in the Walsall Advertiser and Sutton Coldfield Observer on August 6.",

It’s now ten years since we held our first conference in Birmingham and amongst the 12,000 delegates that converged on the city, were exhibitors as well as the world’s media who were able to shine a light on our region and see some of our many achievements.\nThe Conference generates an estimated £20 million boost to the local economy and we were very well looked after throughout the four days, not least by the West Midlands Police. Thank you.\nConference was also an opportunity for me, as your Member of Parliament, to raise issues with a number of organisations and to discuss matters of interest you have raised. I was able to meet with Guide Dogs for the Blind and learn more about their pavement parking campaign, as well as to speak with the National Farmers Union and reaffirm my support for British farming and food. I also met with the British Heart Foundation, and Royal Mail before meeting Aurrigo and taking the opportunity to try out their driverless pod vehicle on Broad Street.\nNow is a moment of great opportunity, to start to deliver what people voted for at the Referendum, to build a country that works for everyone and extend opportunity to all. Sitting in the Symphony Hall on Wednesday I heard our Prime Minister Theresa May set out her vision for Britain as a country on the global stage. In a moving speech the Prime Minister set out her personal commitment to improve our precious NHS and launched a new Cancer Strategy as part of the long term plan for the NHS, speeding up diagnosis and saving lives. There were further important announcements that will also help my constituents such as freezing fuel duty again, and banning employers from taking a cut of workers tips. The Prime Minister also reiterated her commitment to build the homes we need for the next generation of homeowners.\nOn other fronts, the Boundary Commission have formally presented their final findings to the Government on proposed new Parliamentary constituencies. This will bring changes in the West Midlands. Under these proposals I am very pleased to see that Streetly will remain in the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency, with the addition of two extra wards. It was always important to me to seek to ensure that the Boundary Commission recognised the link between Streetly and Aldridge-Brownhills.\nIn closing, I cannot end without a mention for the many Macmillan coffee mornings that were held across my constituency as part of the World’s Biggest Coffee Morning – the Waterside Café at Wm Wheat & Son’s Garden Centre, The Hawthorns, and Aldridge Library to name but a few.

Following a year in which there were unacceptable numbers of Unauthorised Encampments across Walsall Borough it is absolutely understandable that my constituents were at breaking point.\nThe Government’s consultation will be an opportunity for residents to have their views heard on the issues faced by the settled community when an Unauthorised Encampment arrives on their doorstep and I hope residents from across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency who have been affected by this will participate in this consultation and make their views heard.\nI have repeatedly raised this issue in Parliament because of concerns raised by my constituents.

During this period she remains as our Prime Minister. Throughout her tenure in Downing Street I have seen Theresa May demonstrate a tremendous sense of duty and passion in the service of our Country, and for me personally it has been a privilege to serve as a Government Whip under her premiership.\nIn the coming weeks I will listen to those colleagues who are seeking to be the next Leader of our Party. The Prime Minister may be going, but Brexit is still to be delivered, and as the results of the Euro elections demonstrate, the message is very clear – get on with it! I will therefore be asking candidates how they plan to deliver Brexit and, equally important, what their vision is for the future. This is important to me and I believe it is also important to my constituents in Streetly and indeed across Aldridge-Brownhills.\nAs Prime Minister, Theresa May has successfully presided over a growing economy, as we managed to eliminate the deficit and bring an end to the austerity agenda, leaving our economy in an even stronger position for her successor to take forward. She has shown unprecedented stoicism in the face of terrorist attacks in our country, and her personal commitment to our NHS means it now has a longer-term vision, significantly increased funding and a 10-year plan.\nLeaving aside for a moment the debate on leadership and Brexit that will undoubtedly continue a little longer, there is one constant in UK politics and that is the Palace of Westminster. The building itself is unique. It is world famous and has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1987. It is one of the most visited and photographed buildings in the world, with over a million visitors a year and has more than 15,000 staff who work onsite on a daily basis. However, the fabric of the Palace is increasingly in urgent need of repair, and I was pleased that in Parliament last week we took further steps towards beginning a process of restoration and renewal across the parliamentary estate.\nIt is unlikely that leaving the Palace itself will begin before the mid-2020’s, but plans are now being made to ensure that the democratic process will be seamless throughout this period, as Parliament still needs to function, debate and legislate. I am sure the next few weeks at Westminster are going to be interesting, but amidst all that is going on, let us not lose sight of the importance and strength of our democracy, for today and for future generations.\nThis was first published on 31st May in the Royal Sutton Observer",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_private-members-bill-on-assisted-dying/content_253.html": "Thank you, Mr Speaker,\nI realise the enormity of the decision we are being asked to make today. Indeed, it will be huge for those new Members. Like all of those elected in July of this year I had only been in the House for 4 months when a Private Members Bill on Assisted Dying was brought forward in the 2015 Parliament.\nI concluded in September 2015 that I could not support the legislation on assisted dying. Today I still have concerns, and whilst I have no doubt about the sincerity of the Honourable Lady for Spen Valley’s intentions. I do have to say good intentions do not always yield good results.\nThe importance of this debate is monumental and that is underpinned by the literally hundreds of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituents who have written to me about this matter.\nAs well as addressing the substantive points in the Bill I would also like to address some of the procedural matters pertaining to this legislation.\nI know that the Honourable Lady for Spen Valley last week circulated a letter from our former Clerk Sir David Natzler, however I still have some grave concerns about this Bill procedurally.\nIt is correct that some of the most pioneering social legislation of the Post War period was introduced in a similar way, most notably the 1967 Abortion Act and the 1967 Sexual Offences Act to decriminalise homosexuality. However, both bills had gone through an extensive government led public enquiry to pave the way for legislation not least of all the Medical Advisory Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir John Peel to consider the Abortion Bill and the Wolfenden Commission to consider the laws on homosexuality something which the Bill before us today gravely lacks.\nIndeed the government have set up a wide range of policy reviews and I would suggest that it would be totally appropriate for them to have considered such a review into the matter of assisted dying not least of all to consider the full implications such legislation would have for the National Health Service and not least of all the fact that there is no mention of funding on the face of the Bill.\nWhilst remaining neutral the British Medical Association have set four key tests that they would want to see if the legislation is enacted. They are:\n- A General Approach to cover an opt in model for Doctors.\n- Protection from discrimination and abuse.\n- Delivering an assisted dying service, essentially delivering this as a separate service.\n- Oversight and regulation to ensure an open and transparent service.\nMr Speaker, I do not believe all of the key tests as set out by the BMA have been met.\nMuch also has been made in this debate and in the run up to this debate with regards to this legislation being a slippery slope and that in the future this bill will be further extended.\nWell, the reason that this is so often referred to Mr Speaker, is because that is the experience from other countries who have legislated in this area.\nThat is the situation in Canada, where from 2027 euthanasia will be widened to include people with psychiatric illnesses.\nIn Belgium where euthanasia was legalised in 2002, by 2014 the law was amended to allow children the right to choose and within 3 years a 9 year old and a 11 year old became the first young children to end their lives.\nAs a modern society we have come to terms with death, but I truly believe we need to be more focussed on improved promotion for hospices and better palliative care with greater levels of funding and recognition for the work which they do, and I see in my own Borough in Walsall not least of all at St Giles and Acorns Children Hospices.\nMr Speaker, as I have said the Bill being brought forward maybe with the best of intentions but for the reasons I have outlined I cannot support it today.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-its-a-whips-life/content_527.html": "Constituents quite rightly ask me about my work in Parliament, and often they enquire about my role as a “Whip”. So, as something of a change for this weeks View from the House I have decided to share with you a View from the Whips Office.\nAll the main political parties have Whips in the House of Commons, and earlier this year I was invited by the Prime Minister to join the Government as an Assistant Whip. As a whip it is my job to help ensure the smooth passage of government business through the House of Commons, but also to ensure that the views and concerns of colleagues are heard. We also play a pastoral role too.\nThe expression ‘Whip’ is in itself an interesting one, and has its origins in 18th century hunting terminology. The term ‘whipper-in’ was the huntsman’s assistant who kept the hounds from straying, and it was said that every hunt must have a ‘whipper in’.\nWhilst the practise of getting people into Parliament for votes, and persuading them to vote in a certain way goes back hundreds of years, the Parliamentary world of today is very different to that of the last few centuries.\nThat said, there is much about the role of ‘Whips’ that has not changed and duties include keeping MP’s informed of Parliamentary business, maintaining the Party’s voting strength and passing onto the leadership the views of backbench members. One of the most important jobs though, it that of “telling”, which refers to counting the MPs as they pass through the Aye or No lobby to vote. It may seem like a simple task but believe you me it is not always so, especially on evenings of multiple votes! Once everyone has passed through the lobbies the Tellers on duty return to the Chamber and in true parliamentary style, formally announce the result to the Speaker.\nI have read and heard many tales about the Whips – I have heard Parliament sometimes described as a stage with the Whips acting as the stage managers – who turn the lights on at the beginning of the day, make sure it all runs smoothly and turn the lights off at the end of the day. I leave others to make their judgement on this.\nOf one thing I am certain though, it remains an honour to serve as a Whip, and whilst it has certainly changed the nature of my work, I remain committed to representing you at Westminster and to continuing to bang the drum for this constituency.\nParliament returns next week and as I prepare to return to Westminster, after a busy summer of surgeries and visits, I hope you have all had an enjoyable summer too.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 31st August 2018",

I was very pleased to be there to give my support to “Finn’s Law” as it passed through the House of Commons, and taking it one step closer to becoming law and providing greater protection to these amazing service animals. I was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful police dog “Finn” when he popped in to the office!\nMeanwhile back at home in the constituency, and Streetly residents continue to raise with me their concerns about the proposed introduction of car parking charges at Sutton Park.\nFollowing representations I made to Birmingham City Council I have been assured that they will be holding discussions with Walsall Council about their proposal, and the impact that potential displacement parking will have on residential streets in Streetly. My reservations remain. I would encourage residents to make their views known to Birmingham City when the consultation opens later this month.\nFinally I would like to thank our fantastic local Police Officers with whom I spent last Saturday afternoon out and about in the community. It was a great opportunity for me to see first-hand how they are tackling crime both in a proactive and reactive way. It also gave me an informative insight in to the various jobs our hardworking local policing team undertake on the front line day and night, to keep us safe locally.\nWith Brexit undoubtedly set to intensify and dominate the next few weeks at Westminster, let us not lose sight of the important local matters too.\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 15 February 2019.",

I remain concerned that in large parts of the constituency this graffiti remains in place two months after the election and degrades so much of the hard work done by volunteers from across Aldridge-Brownhills to keep our area clean and green.\nI have welcomed the Government’s proposed domestic violence legislation and the intention to hold a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal which affect more than 2,000 families in the 1970’s and 1980’s.\nCommunity safety issues continue to remain of importance to all of us and I have continued to raise with Government Ministers issues concerning public safety which have affected the local area in recent weeks as well as seeking reassurances from the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd on matters raised with me by residents concerning problems with the Police 101 telephone number.\nNew legislation introduced in Parliament to improve telecommunications infrastructure is an important piece of legislation which will enable full-fibre broadband to reach across Aldridge-Brownhills. As part of my contribution to the debate I highlighted how important this legislation will be to ensure that our shops in Aldridge Village Centre or on Brownhills High Street as well as on our business parks which create jobs, drive investment and develop skills will benefit from improved communications to help drive our local economy.\nAs Parliament started their Summer Recess we were reminded why the Government continue to monitor the activity of our energy companies, following British Gas’ proposed inflation busting price increase on household customers. The British Gas announcement is unacceptable and as I reminded Government Ministers at the start of July it is essential that we do more to make it easier for people to switch their energy suppliers.\nWhen Parliament resumes in September we will begin to debate the first stages of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill and I will once again be speaking up for the residents of Aldridge-Brownhills to ensure we honour the outcome of the referendum and begin paving the way towards a truly Global Britain.

One such issue is that of housing and the green belt. We all know that we need more homes, but that doesn’t have to mean building over our last remaining local green spaces. We need to focus on brownfield first.\nI was pleased therefore to learn that whether it is Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson who succeeds as our next Prime Minister, both of them have made it clear that they wish to protect the Green Belt and green open spaces.\nSince my last “View from the House” column, in which I wrote of my continued opposition to development on the Green Belt, a number of residents have continued to contact me. They too have raised their concerns about the speculative development proposal for 1,500 new homes on land opposite Aldridge Road known as Columba Park.\nIndeed one local resident who contacted me has set up his own petition to oppose this potential development. Like me, they seek to oppose any development on this site and other Green Belt sites, and the petition is seeking to have this matter put on the agenda for debate at Walsall Council at a future Council meeting. I wholeheartedly support this initiative and urge residents from across Streetly to sign the online petition which can be found at https://bit.ly/SaveOurGreenSpaces so that, together, we can ensure that we continue to lay down markers that our Green Belt matters to us.\nOver the course of this summer, I will continue to campaign on this issue, and I will be contacting residents directly. I hope that you will agree with me that together we can make a difference for future generations by insisting The Black Country Core Strategy switches its emphasis to developing brownfield sites first and not developing our precious green and open spaces.\nIn other news, the Birmingham City Council consultation on the proposed removal of the Perry Barr flyover has now been extended to 2nd August.\nHaving examined the proposals to remove the A34 Perry Barr flyover, putting all traffic onto a dual carriageway at ground level, I believe this will have a detrimental effect on residents from across Streetly, increasing our commuting times and traffic flows. I would therefore strongly urge residents to take advantage of the extended consultation period to make their views known at www.birminghambeheard.org.uk/economy/a34perrybarr/ .\nWith school holidays fast approaching I have been catching up on local school visits, and it was a pleasure to visit Streetly Academy and meet Head Teacher Mr Billy Downie, and students to hear more about the schools development and some of the inspiring initiatives they are currently undertaking in the field of sport to widen and broaden pupil participation.

It is a worthy reminder of the dedication and work that goes on quietly behind the scenes to make things happen and ensure the success of each and every coffee morning, sports event, fun day or community showcase, much of it done by volunteers. We don’t always recognise our volunteers enough but they are part of what brings our local communities together.\nI recently met with a group of young people enrolled on the National Citizen Service – a voluntary programme designed to encourage personal and social development through activities requiring leadership and community involvement. They too shared the value of volunteering and were actively involved in planning a project at The Hothouse in Aldridge – itself at the heart of the local community.\nAs the summer draws to a close, the cricket season comes to an end and the days begin to grow that little bit shorter, it is time to look forward to the return of Parliament when we will be debating a number of Private Members Bills in the chamber. This will include my own Private Members Bill, which is titled The NHS (Charitable Trusts etc) Bill. It will receive its second hearing in November. The purpose behind the Bill is to make provision to allow the rights of royalties from JM Barrie’s Peter Pan stories to be transferred to the new independent Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity – but more on that in the weeks ahead.\nBefore then however, we will be debating the Assisted Dying Bill. This is an emotive and very sensitive subject, on which I have already received a number of letters and emails from my constituents and if you have not already contacted me and wish to express your views please do write to me at my Constituency office, at 82 Walsall Road, Aldridge, WS9 0JW, or email me at wendy.morton.mp@parliament.uk. As always, I welcome your views.\nA version of this article was originally published in the Walsall Advertiser and Sutton Coldfield Observer on August 27.",

For many months volunteer gardeners, together with the district centre manager and local businesses have been working tirelessly to create the stunning floral displays we have all enjoyed this summer and to keep the place looking tidy. Their enthusiasm, hardwork and commitment has been rightly recognised. Thank you everyone who has been a part of this.\nAldridge now goes forward to the National Final next year.\nOn Saturday there was more community gardening activity with the Aldridge in Bloom World record bulb planting attempt. Alas the record was not broken, but it was good fun to be part of this community effort, knowing that next spring we will all see the colourful blooms on The Croft.",

As the door of No 10 closed on Theresa May, so it opened for Boris Johnson. The Country has a new Leader of the Conservative Party, and a new Prime Minister. As a strong and determined former Mayor of London, Boris has the experience, gravitas and the sense of purpose to unite our country at a time when we face some uncertainty and complex issues. He has set out his clear determination to ensure that we honour the outcome of the 2016 Referendum and leave the European Union by the 31st October deadline, and as our new Prime Minister he has already made an energetic and determined start. I was very pleased to see that in his first week in the job his first visit outside of London was here to the West Midlands to set out his Government’s commitment to recruit 20,000 more police officers and make our streets safer. Residents from across Streetly have often said to me that they want to see more Police Officers in our neighbourhoods, protecting the public and helping us tackle the blight of crime in our communities. It is an issue I have raised with Ministers too. So I particularly welcome the commitment from our new Prime Minister to a recruitment campaign starting this September. Recruitment, training and delivery will be key and so it is good to see that a new national policing board is also being established, under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary, to hold the police to account for meeting this target and driving the national response. Locally I will of course continue to ask that we receive our fair share of additional resources and will be continuing to campaign to keep Aldridge Police Station. With a new Prime Minister there inevitably comes change within Government, and on a personal level I was delighted to accept the invitation from the PM to become the new Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice. It is a tremendous privilege to be appointed to such a role, and in doing so I become the first Member of Parliament from Aldridge-Brownhills to join the Government as a Minister. Rest assured, that this does not mean that my duties or responsibilities to all of my constituents in Aldridge-Brownhills are diminished in any way. I am still your Member of Parliament and I will continue to represent your views at Westminster. The House is now in Recess for summer, giving me greater opportunity to hold some of my drop-in MP community surgeries, and continue with local constituency matters. As always I look forward to meeting you when I am out and about across Streetly and my wider constituency. This article was first published in the Royal Sutton Observer on 2nd August 2019 |",

It is therefore only right that we continue to show how much we value their efforts once they leave the armed forces.\nLast week the Government announced that we will introduce a new Veterans Railcard from 11 November this year. This railcard will extend discounted train travel to the more than 830,000 veterans not covered by existing discounts.\nI believe it is important that our veterans have access to this railcard, supporting their access to vital work prospects and retraining opportunities, and making it easier for former members of the armed forces to stay in touch with friends and relatives.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_in-so-many-instances-covid-19-has-brought-out-the-best-of-all-of-us/content_449.html": "Writing for this edition of the Sutton Observer we have been in lock down for 5-weeks, helping fight the battle against Coronavirus, a disease that has posed the biggest threat to our country in decades. This is without doubt an extremely testing time for our country and for individuals but by following the Government’s advice to ‘Stay at Home, Protect the NHS and Save Lives’ we are starting to see the benefit of that hard work. It is thanks to you for playing your part and following the Government’s advice that we will overcome Coronavirus.\nThe battle against this pandemic is one that will take us many months, and social distancing measures will sadly have to remain part of our daily lives as we emerge from the lock down period. This means we must find new ways of working, and that is includes Parliament, as well as new ways of socialising and communicating with family and friends.\nDay in and day out during this pandemic we have been superbly served by all of our key workers operating across front line services, care homes, supermarkets, and pharmacies. I thank you all, and I thank our NHS and the incredible work they are doing on our behalf.\nIn so many instances Covid-19 has brought out the best of all of us in Britain and in our local communities, whether that is the weekly clap for carers, the increased sense of neighbourliness – albeit socially distanced – and our generosity by supporting initiatives such as the ‘Big Night In’ and Captain Tom Moore’s heroic 100 laps for 100 years.\nHowever, there are also signs that the lockdown associated with Covid-19 is having a detrimental impact on some families who suffer at the hands of domestic abusers.\nDomestic abuse is a pernicious crime that can affect anyone. Experienced predominantly, but not exclusively, by women, we know that there are men who suffer to. There are children who witness it and remain at risk, and concerned families, friends and neighbours who are affected too.\nThe Government launched a public awareness campaign in April highlighting that if anyone is at risk of or experiencing domestic abuse, help is still available, during the Coronavirus pandemic. The campaign #YouAreNotAlone includes a Freephone, 24 hour National Domestic Abuse Helpline number 0808 2000 247 run by Refuge and, www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk.\nIt’s good to welcome the Domestic Abuse Bill back to parliament this week too. A landmark piece of legislation which commands cross party support across the House of Commons, the Domestic Abuse Bill will raise awareness and understanding about the devastating impact of domestic abuse on victims and their families. It will also help transform our response as a society, helping to prevent offending, protect victims and support their families to ensure they have the support they need.\nToo often, and hidden away behind closed doors, domestic abuse has destroyed lives and has torn families apart. This new legislation is an opportunity for us all to help those who suffer from this deeply harmful crime and will ensure that there is greater support for victims when bringing the perpetrators to justice.\nStay Safe. Stay Well.\nThis article was first published in the Royal Sutton Observer Friday 1st May 2020",

The four Black Country Authorities including, Walsall Council, have recently commenced their Black Country Core Strategy Consultation. It is a document essentially about planning for our future, including Housing, Employment, Environment and Transport.\nImportantly for us, the consultation looks at housing needs up to 2036, and seeks to identify future growth areas within the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency. I have always taken the view that we need a ‘Brownfield first’ approach to housing and development, allowing us to protect our precious Green Belt. It is absolutely vital that the views of residents from right across the constituency are heard. If you want to take part in the consultation it runs up to 8 September and details can be found at: www.blackcountrycorestrategy.dudley.gov.uk\nGroups of hard-working and dedicated volunteers often work quietly behind the scenes, supporting our local communities, something which those of you who regularly follow my column will know I often refer to. Their impact is huge, and even the smallest contributions can collectively make as big difference. The local Aldridge Volunteer Gardeners, together with all those who have collectively been working as part of the In Bloom team, are an excellent example. Their hard work and effort is to be admired and commended and I wish them all the best in this years competition. Whatever the outcome, and we will have to wait until later in the year to hear, I am sure we can all agree that the Village looks splendid once again this year, and it shows community spirit at its finest.\nIt is therefore frustrating that across our area we continue to suffer the incursions of Travellers who do not share this respect for neighbours and the local environment, leaving behind a trail of rubbish and mess for others to clean up. This is a matter I have raised both locally and at Westminster and will continue to do so as quite clearly more needs to be done to tackle this issue.\nLocally the decision by Walsall Council to buy the Sadler Centre in Walsall town centre for the staggering sum of £13.8 million when earlier this summer the Council closed the doors of libraries in Pelsall, Rushall and Walsall Wood and have failed to provide any strategy or vision for Ravenscourt in Brownhills, demonstrates a breath-taking lack of reality of the needs of residents in our area.

The proposed plan has left me shocked at the sheer scale of development being proposed for my constituency.\nAt its heart the proposal should have been looking at viable opportunities to provide housing and employment across our communities on appropriate local sites.\nInstead, the proposal simply seeks to drive a coach and horses through the green lungs of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.\nThe proposed development on our precious Green Belt is unacceptable to me and I know from the many emails that I have already received on this matter that it is unacceptable to you too.\nI am still of the firm belief that there are an adequate number of brownfield sites across the Black Country which should be developed first instead of forging ahead with the wholesale destruction of our Green Belt and Open Spaces.\nThat’s why I will be questioning the housing allocation numbers and asking why it is that my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and the wider Walsall area are being expected to do the heavy lifting and why we are being asked to take a disproportionate number of houses.\nWhilst at this stage the Black Country Plan is only a ‘proposal, it remains extremely important that when the consultation starts in August we all feed in our views.\nWhen I have further information about the consultation I will update you all.\nHowever, please be assured that I will be opposing this plan on behalf of the residents of my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency.",

The UK and Estonia have a long history of working together across defence and 2018 marks 100 years since the earliest cooperation between our Royal Navy and Estonia. Today Britain continues to play an important part, alongside our allies, in European security, defending the rule of law by which we all stand and upholding our values of democracy.\nThis issue of Britain’s continued commitment to security post-Brexit is one I raised recently with the Prime Minister in the House of Commons. We will continue to work with our allies on a number of operations and programmes in which we are involved in the EU and which would be beneficial to continue to do so.\nAs I frequently write here, Government continues to work on many issues not just Brexit and those which are covered by the main news headlines. With the challenge that winter brings and in particular the additional pressures it places on the NHS the Government’s recent announcement of extra funding to help cope with this was good news.\nLocally for Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust this means our winter allocation is up to £1.7 million. This extra support is to be welcomed and I appreciate our hospitals and wider healthcare system have prepared earlier than ever before for winter.\nIn other news, proposals are being developed to crackdown on puppies being treated in unhealthy circumstances by unscrupulous breeders who have no regard whatsoever for their welfare.

Indeed, Birmingham City Council’s own technical report highlights that their proposal to remove the flyover would actually make traffic flow worse, not to mention the disruption it is going to cause everyone concerned.\nWhilst we all welcome the fact that the West Midlands is hosting the Commonwealth Games in 2022 and everyone realizes that construction work will have to be undertaken, I am concerned that this proposal to remove the Perry Barr flyover will not leave a lasting benefit of the Games but an on-going headache for commuters from across my constituency.\nThe consultation closes on 19th July and I would urge residents to make their views known www.birminghambeheard.org.uk/economy/a34perrybarr/.",

This also means an increase in traffic movement of over 700% at a site that has limited access.\nThis variation is completely unacceptable. It is not a well-meaning proposition. It is a commercial venture seeking to usurp the planning system.\nI am extremely concerned about this proposal. I have written to Walsall Council to express my concerns about this completely unnecessary planning variation that will have a detrimental impact on local residents living within the vicinity of this site and I will continue to work with local Councillors to keep residents informed.\nResidents have until Wednesday 3 July to object to this proposal and they can do so on Walsall Council‘s website https://go.walsall.gov.uk/planning",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-tackling-the-issues-which-matter-to-you/content_1194.html": "Dementia is one of the main health issues we face today. Sadly, someone develops the condition every three minutes and increasingly people are facing the situation alone.\nBack in 2013 the Alzheimer’s Society launched the Dementia Friends initiative to tackle the stigma of dementia which all too often results in people with dementia becoming socially isolated. As a result of this initiative there are now more than two million Dementia Friends transforming the way people act, think and talk about the condition, and last month I was pleased to hold my own Dementia Friends awareness training session in the constituency. The aim of the Alzheimer’s Society is to create more communities and businesses that are dementia friendly so that people affected by dementia feel understood and included.\nThe increasing need to raise awareness of conditions such as dementia comes at a time when the Government is also seeking to address the need for a more sustainable future for high quality social care.\nBy 2020 we will have one million more people over the age of 70 in Britain than in 2015. Indeed, here in Aldridge-Brownhills more than a fifth of our population are of retirement age. As a society we need to find a solution to enable all adults to live well into later life with sustainable public services that support them to do so. For too long successive Governments have kicked this can down the road. It’s time to address this.\nThe Prime Minister has spoken consistently about the need for a three pronged approach to dealing with this issue. In the short-term the Government have made extra funding available to local Councils through the introduction of the adult social care ‘precept’ and a £2 billion cash injection in this year’s budget. In the medium term we need to ensure that best practice is observed across all areas to ensure that we prevent delayed hospital discharges and prevent people from being in hospital unnecessarily. Whilst, in the longer term we need a more sustainable footing for our social care system which works for everyone.\nIt is this Government that is seeking to bring forward proposals for consultation, hoping to build consensus around a lasting solution, which at its heart will seek to support people, families and communities to prepare for their old age with certainty and dignity.\nThis weekend, across the country, we will stop and come together to remember all those brave men and women who served our country, to ensure our freedom today. I will be joining one of our local Acts of Remembrance honouring those from our community who served our country. A symbol of our respect, it is also our strength as a nation.\nThis was first published by the Walsall Advertiser and the Sutton Observer on 10 November 2017.",

For individuals who have no known grave, they have built memorials to the missing as places of commemoration.\nThe work of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission continues through their staff, supporters and volunteers who ensure that the stories of those who died are told. This year they invite us to Discover, Learn and Remember about the lives of the 1.7million men and women of the Commonwealth commemorated by the CWGC.\nThank you to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, and all those who volunteer locally.\nYou can find more information on their work here: https://www.cwgc.org/war-graves-week/",

This could lead to food security challenges and result in higher food prices, further driving inflation. I assure you all that I will work relentlessly to combat this assault on our farmers, our rural economy, and our food security.\nI also popped into Hayhead Farm Shop and Hayhead Butchers to further show my support for our local farmers.

We are also redoubling our commitment to skills and world-class infrastructure, staying at the cutting edge of clean growth, whilst tackling the big challenges, such as knife crime, head on.\nAs we are all too aware, knife crime continues to be a persistent problem. This bothers me.

The funding will be provided directly to Police and Crime Commissioners and a majority of the money will be coming to metropolitan areas, including the West Midlands region.\nI was also pleased to see the Spring Statement reiterate that from this April hard-working families will once again be rewarded with a further increase in the National Living Wage and an increase in their personal tax allowances rising to £12,500 next April, up from £6,475 when the Government came to power in 2010.\nHome ownership is something that for too long, too many young people have only been able to dream of. The ambition to restore this dream was clear in the Spring Statement with a commitment to a further £3billion to deliver 30,000 more affordable homes.\nIn a week that was dominated by Brexit, I feel we should not overlook the Spring Statement and as your MP I feel it is important to highlight some of the key points.",

The journey from Farm to Fork has never been more complex than it is today.\nFood security has many dimensions, including availability, affordability, nutrition, and fairness to farmers. I am therefore pleased to hear of the success of last week’s Farm to Fork Summit 2023 which seeks to build on the Government’s Food Strategy by setting out a clear vision for a prosperous agri-food sector that ensures a secure food supply.\nAs a Farmer’s daughter myself, I am well aware of the challenges faced by the farming industry both locally and across the UK. We need to address this now as farmer’s play an essential role in our local economy as well as in the national production of food.\nThe Summit last week set out a range of new measures I welcome including; supply chain fairness – ensuring farmers get a fair price for their produce, innovation in the farming sector – investment in innovative technologies to strengthen our food security, labour and skills – ensuring farmers have access to the workforce they need when they need it, water and energy security – by improving infrastructure.\nNow that we are outside the EU, we need to use the flexibility we have to listen to the industry, to work with the sector and to ensure that we can respond to its needs and boot trade and export opportunities to get more British food on plates here in the UK and across the world with a commitment to protecting the UK’s high food and welfare standards and prioritise new export opportunities.\nIf we are to stop a repeat of the shortages on our shelves we saw earlier in the year, then we need food security and we much do more to grow our food and farming industry. Farming must be viable and economically sustainable as we all as environmentally sustainable.\nI was also able to raise the issue of the cumulative impact of solar panels on agricultural land, the role farmers play as guardians of the countryside, the importance of our precious greenbelt and green spaces and I am grateful to the Minister for his response.\nClick here if you want to follow the debate: https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/4004aa9c-6108-439d-93a5-36ab69a81d28",

However, let’s not forget the successful roll out of the three vaccination programmes for all adults. This is an incredible achievement and is testament to the hard work of our NHS professionals, the military and the many volunteers who are helping too – as I saw for myself at both the Oak Park and Saddler Centre vaccination centres, and on the vaccination bus. Thank you all.\nThe quiet work of so many neighbours, friends and colleagues and the work of our local community groups and churches in supporting families and individuals affected by Covid, is tremendous not least during what has been a year of great challenge. They deserve our thanks too.\nHowever, notwithstanding the challenges, there have been a considerable number of highlights for me personally during 2021 as your Member of Parliament – From a health and history walk with the Thomas Project, to calling in at the Macmillan Cancer coffee morning in Pelsall, visits to Leighswood School and Aldridge School, the return of the Brownhills Canalside Festival and meetings with many of our local businesses, church leaders, and local councillors. The strength and resilience of our communities, and the sense of community spirit, is clear and I would like to thank everyone for the work you continue to do week in and week out to make Aldridge-Brownhills constituency the best!\nAs we start the New Year I remain committed as your Member of Parliament to campaign on the issues which matter to us here in Aldridge-Brownhills, seeking to champion our local communities whilst ensuring we protect our precious Green Belt and Open Spaces and seek to develop new homes for the next generation.\nIn 2021 we saw the first iteration of the Black Country Plan. The proposed development plan is unacceptable to many of my constituents and it is unacceptable to me. There will be further revisions to the plan in 2022 and it will be incumbent upon us all to once again submit our views on the proposals.\nI will also continue to speak up about the need for regeneration of our High Streets and Village Centres. As we ended 2021 we saw some important and very welcome progress towards the regeneration of Brownhills with the completion of the Civic Square and the first steps towards redevelopment of the former Ravenscourt shopping centre.\nSince being elected as your Member of Parliament I have campaigned for the return of passenger trains and a station at Aldridge and I will continue to work with our West Midlands Mayor Andy Street to progress this opportunity. I am hoping we will have some exciting news in 2022.\nAs someone who set up a small business I have always been proud to champion our small businesses as well as ensuring they receive the support they need from the Government. This remains a priority for me this year as we seek to Build Back Better after the pandemic.\nAs we say goodbye to 2021, a year in which despite everything, a lot still happened, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all the very best for 2022.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future/content_1601.html": "| With Westminster now in summer recess, there comes an opportunity for me as your Member of Parliament to pause and reflect on what has certainly been a hectic 12 months since the General Election, and although Brexit is a preoccupation for media attention, I can assure you that life at Westminster is not always all about Brexit!\nIt is also about remaining focussed on building a Britain that works for everyone, concentrating on creating a stronger, fairer economy and a more caring society – one where every generation can do better than the last.\nCentral to this is a commitment to taking a balanced approach to our economy, an approach that allows us to deal with our debts, invest in key public services, and keep taxes low.\nIn April, the Government raised the Personal Allowance again and increased the National Living Wage to £7.83 per hour, allowing families to keep more money in their pockets. Just before Parliament rose for the summer recess we saw the welcome announcement of the biggest pay rise in almost 10 years for around one million public sector workers across Britain meaning the public service will get a pay rise that they deserve.\nThe economy has now grown for eight consecutive years, employment is up by 3.3 million since 2010, and the unemployment rate is at its joint lowest level since 1975, with more jobs and employment opportunities locally too. One particularly important matter for us locally is health and like you, my family and I have always relied on the NHS. The Prime Minister’s recent announcement of a long term plan and a five year funding settlement was to be welcomed, and under the plan NHS funding will grow year on year and by 2023-24 the NHS England budget will increase by an extra £20billion a year in real terms, ensuring patients receive world-class healthcare. With steps to help people get a foot on the housing ladder, as well as building more homes and backing home ownership schemes, improving our schools, colleges and universities, the introduction of an energy price cap, stronger protections for animal welfare, and tough action on plastic waste, these are just some of the many recent key achievements.\nI would agree there is still more we can do to create that fairer society we all want to see but that is why we must continue our hard work to build an economy where everyone’s hard work is recognised and rewarded and a country where we provide strong leadership in the world as a truly ‘Global Britain’.\nWhether you are preparing for your summer holidays, or like me will be spending time at home with family and friends hopefully enjoying a little more of the Great British Weather – I wish you all a good summer. |\nThis article was first published in the Sutton Observer on 10th August 2018",

It is a privilege and an honour to represent Aldridge-Brownhills at Westminster and there are still days when I sit on the green benches and pinch myself that it is real. Family, friends and local residents often ask me if being an MP is what I expected. In many ways it was a step in to the unknown, and whilst I had often been into the House of Commons I would be the first to admit that parliamentary procedures, processes, traditions and customs, quirky as they so often seemed were entirely new to me! Working without an office for the first few weeks, begging the use of a desk or a printer, learning how the place ticks, the division bell calling us to vote and, of course, finding your way around without getting lost! One year on, there is still much to learn, but the place is a little more familiar. It has been a memorable year in many ways, which has included making my maiden speech, my first question to the Prime Minister and of course my Private Members Bill which I successfully steered through Parliament and is now the NHS Charitable Trusts etc. Act 2016. I also joined the All Party Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme, and have spent time with the Royal Navy, including the Royal Marines whilst training in northern Norway.\nThe last year has also brought with it many serious debates and challenges both nationally and across the world: the Syrian Refugee crisis, the Paris Bombings, English votes for English laws, the Steel Industry as well as often very moving debates on matters such as assisted dying, and brain tumour research. As I have found out over the last 12 months, the mood in Parliament can be noisy and loud – it can, however, be calm and reflective. There has also been the work of Government to deliver on manifesto promises, securing the economy and building a stronger and brighter future for us all, and as a new MP I have taken part in debates, raised points and asked questions on a range of topics including protecting the green belt, the important role of local charities, and support for enterprise, apprenticeships and jobs. In my role on the International Development Select Committee I have also been able to play a part in scrutinising the work of Government, which is vital too. Alongside my work at Westminster it has also been really important to me to be able to return home to the constituency at weekends and during recesses. Whether it’s a school visit, meeting with local businesses, or community organisations, attending local events, or popping into a coffee morning there have been many memorable occasions, and right across Aldridge-Brownhills, from Streetly to Pelsall, Rushall, Shelfield and High Heath to Walsall Wood there is a very special sense of community.",

Putting this into context Aldridge-Brownhills constituency has approximately 64,000 electors.\nThis is not the only home that Jordan has created for displaced Syrians. The camp at Za’atari provides shelter to 80,000 refugees, and many thousands more live in Za’atari camp and thousands more live within host communities. Jordan is not alone. Countries such as Lebanon should also be applauded for the tremendous work they are doing to host and support refugees affected by the Syria crisis.\nPart of the committee’s work is focussed on looking at education in response to emergency situations and that is why in Jordan I visited a number of education projects. I met with refugees – who like any parents, simply want their children to be able to go to school and have an education.\nTeachers inside the camp and within host community schools explained the challenges of operating double shift schools, and I heard at first hand from aid workers and some of the many International charities and organisations who are providing vital support and assistance, such as UNICEF, Mercy Corps and a Makani Child Protection Centre.\nFrom my visit it was clear that significant progress is being made, but it is also clear that significant challenges remain. The visit was a stark reminder of the gravity, complexity and fragility of the situation. As the war continues in Syria so too does the suffering. It is estimated that a further 80,000 refugees are now stuck in an area known as the “berm” on the Syria/Jordan border, following a bomb attack in June. These people have gathered in this area, with little, if any, access to humanitarian aid.\n“Be in no doubt, these are difficult circumstances stemming from a protracted crisis, and returning to the UK I am left with as many questions as answers, and much to reflect upon. UK aid makes a positive contribution and a real difference to people’s lives but we must keep the pressure on the international donor community to continue to help to, and , above all, remain focussed on playing our part in achieving a peaceful and lasting political solution to this crisis.”\nWhen completed, the Committee’s report will be publically available on the committee Website :- http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee.",

If you would be interested in attending a future Dementia Friends training, please do not hesitate to contact wendy.morton.mp@parliament.uk\nThe Dementia Friends programme is led by the Alzheimer’s Society and is a national social action movement to change the way people think, speak and act about dementia. It aims to transform the way the nation thinks, talks and acts about the condition.\nAlzheimer’s Society’s research shows that many people are worried about ‘saying the wrong thing’ to people living with dementia. And despite almost all of us knowing someone affected, two-thirds of people living with dementia report feeling isolated and lonely.\nThat’s why this Dementia Action Week, we are being encouraged to take action by starting a conversation with someone we know who is living with dementia; whether it’s calling a relative with dementia or visiting a neighbour, it’s time for all of us to start talking.\nI hope this Dementia Action Week you will consider becoming a Dementia Friend. This is a week for turning understanding into action, to help all those affected by dementia. Big or small actions can improve the everyday lives of people affected by dementia and that is where the Dementia Friends programme can help.",

I hope that Dogs Trust’s campaign will motivate the Government to progress with the Kept Animals Bill and to include their recommendation of including a requirement to carry out a visual check on dogs entering the country, as this will be a key factor in bringing about the end of Puppy Smuggling.",

We have also published draft guidance to underpin new knife crime prevention orders, which will give the police an additional power to help steer vulnerable people away from serious violence.\nIt is important that the police have the support, resources and powers they need.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-community-safety-remains-a-top-priority/content_674.html": "With Parliament now in Recess for the summer I want to take this opportunity to reflect upon events locally and nationally. Sadly in recent weeks and months our local community in Aldridge has been left shaken by a number of events which culminated in the recent community safety meeting. This provided an opportunity for residents to voice their concerns and frustrations and to seek answers and reassurances from community leaders on a range of matters. I would like to thank everyone who participated in this meeting for engaging so constructively, and also to our local Neighbourhood Watch for their attendance.\nIn advance of the meeting I raised a number of matters with Ministers at Westminster and I have since written to the Home Secretary, more specifically, with regards to the concerns raised about the shortcomings of the non-emergency 101 Police contact telephone number. It is incumbent on all of us involved in that meeting to consider how we advance the issues raised by local residents to ensure that Aldridge remains a strong and vibrant community for the benefit of all residents.\nIn the last week before Recess the Government started to build on the decision to trigger Article 50 and formally laid before Parliament the European Union Withdrawal Bill. This legislation will facilitate our exit from the European Union and will begin paving the way for a ‘Global Britain’, where we will pass our own laws and govern ourselves and in which we will look beyond the continent of Europe and embrace the opportunities of the wider world.\nAs the school academic year drew to a close I was very pleased by the announcement from the Education Secretary that schools are receiving an extra £1.3 billion in funding over the next two years which means no school will lose any funding. This provides certainty to our local schools and demonstrates the Government’s commitment to continue to raise standards.\nAcross the constituency it has once again been a busy few weeks. It was wonderful to be part of the annual Pelsall Carnival, and later that day to join the Air Cadets from Squadron 1444 (Brownhills) at their Dining-In and awards evening. An entertaining performance from the Shelfield Male Voice Choir, and the Summer Fayre at The Hawthorns in Aldridge were also very enjoyable.\nWith Recess comes the opportunity for me to catch up on constituency work and visits and join more of your events. There may even be the chance to once again take to our wonderful canals.\nA version of this article was originally produced in the Walsall Advertiser 13th July.",

It certainly doesn’t.\nAs a member elected to the International Development Select Committee I am part of a small cross party body of MPs tasked with holding the Government to account on the work of the Department for International Development.\nEarthquakes, Typhoons and the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa are all examples of disasters that need emergency relief. The initial aid is only part of the assistance. Long term recovery plans and sustained development or rebuilding are equally important if not more so. As a committee we are currently taking evidence and holding enquiries into the UK’s response to the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis, and the recent Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. Our aim is to focus on the effectiveness of the aid the UK provided; that it was delivered to those that needed it most, and that follow up assistance is also provided. For the Ebola crisis public education as to how a virus is caught and spread is essential.\nAnother area of the committee’s work is on the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs as they are often referred, which were launched at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September. Members of the Select Committee visited the United Nations last week to learn more and collect evidence for our enquiry. There is only so much that you can learn from typed written reports prepared by others. The attention and focus from world leaders, civil society and people in general was clear. The goals (SDGs) are wide ranging, and include tackling poverty, maternal and child mortality, good governance and accountability, energy policy and the ending of violence against women and girls. The agreed goals are universal though voluntary and have been accepted by our government as well as other members of the UN. It will be interesting to follow over the coming months and years how different governments implement and ultimately achieve these aims.\nYes, there are the humanitarian, justice and social wellbeing elements to the goals but the governance and accountability elements are there and they are vital. With International Development spending set at 0.7% of GDP the role of the Select Committee is ever more important. The scrutiny of our Government, ensuring effective delivery of humanitarian aid and development assistance as we seek to go beyond aid, creating a more sustainable approach. The goals should also help to focus on those countries that receive the aid, particularly development aid, ensuring that it reaches the intended recipients.\nNow back in Aldridge-Brownhills, away from the immediate pressures of Parliament, it is good to be out and about in the community again, to visit some of our schools, spend time with the community nursing team and pop in to the Air Cadets in Brownhills.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_why-theresa-may-will-be-a-great-prime-minister/content_409.html": "In little under three weeks since David Cameron announced his intention to step down, the country has a new Prime Minister, and leader of the Conservative Party.\nWith the leadership contest rapidly concluded David Cameron announced he was leaving No. 10 to make way for Theresa May. He has been an excellent leader who brought about positive reforms across the Country and within the Conservative Party – in particular his drive for more diversity, more women and to ensure we have MPs with a broader range of backgrounds and experience. Something which I believe matters.\nHistory will make its own judgement, and you may well have your own opinions, but let us never forget that back in 2010 the country faced a huge economic challenge. It was David Cameron who successfully pulled around the economy whilst also holding together a coalition Government and delivering many positive reforms and changes. No easy task I am sure. Across the country there are 2.5 million more people in work, and unemployment in my constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills has fallen from 5.1% in May 2010 to just 1.9% in May this year. This is to be welcomed and it was the topic on which I based my last during his final Prime Ministers Questions last Wednesday. Setting aside an impressive record of economic achievement however, I will also remember him for his strong commitment to social justice, his sense of compassion, warmth and humour in the way he connected with people, and the way in which he just got on with the job.\nBut, as the door of No 10 closed on one Prime Minister, so it opened for Theresa May. A strong and determined woman with the experience, gravitas and sense of purpose to unite our country at a time when we face some uncertainty, and some complex issues, as we negotiate the best deal for Britain outside of the EU. But our new Prime Minister has already made an energetic and determined start with the appointment of her new Cabinet, demonstrating the strength of her commitment towards unity and to leaving the European Union.\nIn setting out her vision for the country Theresa has made a commitment to social and economic reform; an economy that works for everyone, an economy whose success is shared by all. In particular I welcome her drive to bring the country back together, her comments on education and that she will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by making Britain a country that works for every one of us.\nPolitics aside, I can not end my last column before summer recess without a mention of two fantastic local events. Last Saturday I attended the final night of Aldridge School’s production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat – a truly amazing performance and one I really enjoyed. Next off, Rosie’s Walk on Sunday – a special day remembering Rosie and supporting the work of Rosie’s Helping Hands Charity, a cause close to the heart of so many in Aldridge.",

The final night of the 2018 Aldridge Youth Theatre pantomime ‘Humpty Dumpty’ was simply superb. The Aldridge Youth Theatre and all of its budding young actors and actresses as well as all of the volunteers who work in the background are an absolute inspiration to us in Aldridge, for the work they do on behalf of the Village and the wider community. It was also wonderful to get my own first ever mention in pantomime – “Oh Yes I did!”\nIt was a privilege to meet the staff and volunteers at the British Red Cross in Streetly no learn more about the work they do. Their service helps people get their lives back on track, often after a stay in hospital, through loaning medical equipment which can make a big difference to mobility.\nAt the end of January I also had the opportunity to go onsite at the new Churchill Retirement Living development in Aldridge Village. This type of specialist retirement housing is proven to have a beneficial effect on older people’s health and wellbeing and the development of new retirement properties is a significant addition to our housing provision.\nI was pleased to meet with Staff and Governors from Ryders Hayes School for a tour of their ‘Young Ryders’ facility for 2-year olds and the magnificent new Teaching School which has been developed. Congratulations to all the Staff and Pupils and thank you again for the visit.\nAs part of the celebration of 100 years since women’s suffrage Sue Satterthwaite and Len Boulton, our magnificent local historians, have put on a display at the Aldridge Library to celebrate the remarkable life of the ‘Aldridge Suffragette’. It was lovely to learn a little more about how Ellen ‘Nell’ Cotton played her part in the Suffragette Movement.\nMy ‘New Year News’ has continued to be delivered, bringing residents an update of my work in Parliament, on the issues which matter to us across the constituency.

Locally we have also had heart-breaking news which has profoundly affected the local community and our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected. Throughout all of this we are reminded of the strong community spirit which runs through the heart of our local area and it is that which continues to bind us together at this time.\nWith the new Parliament formally opened by Her Majesty The Queen, albeit with a little less pomp and pageantry than usual, the Government has signalled its intention for new legislation for what will be a two-year Parliamentary session.\nCentral to the Government’s programme of course is delivering on the Referendum and leaving the European Union. The Queen’s Speech contains eight Parliamentary Bills to deliver a Brexit which works for everyone and I will continue to play my part to ensure we achieve this outcome.\nDuring the housing day debate on the Queen’s Speech I was lucky to be called to speak and to reiterate my commitment to fight for the protection of our precious greenbelt. I remain convinced that there should be a clear focus on “Brownfield First”, a point I will be making later this month to our West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street.\nThe State Opening of Parliament reminds us of our rich history as a nation, indeed the origins of the State Opening can be traced back to the 16th Century. Locally, I was reminded of our own history, too, when I visited the Past and Present Exhibition in Rushall, a fascinating collection of memorabilia that included the part Rushall Hall played in the English Civil War.\nSo often our past helps to shape our future and participating in Armed Forces Day and meeting former service personnel emphasises the on-going debt of gratitude that we owe to so many who protect and keep us safe.\nAs always it is a privilege and a pleasure to be able to join in some of our local events. The Summer Fayre in Aldridge, the BBC Street Auction at St James Church, Brownhills and I can’t forget the Teddy Bear Parachute jump in Pelsall where my own brave Westminster Bear Charlie took the plunge! As the summer holidays approach I greatly looking forward to being part of many more of your events.",

It was lovely to meet Sue and Karen and learn a little more about how Ellen ‘Nell’ Cotton played her part in the Suffragette Movement.\n‘The Aldridge Suffragette’\nMiss Ellen Isabel Cotton “Nell” was born in 1872 and qualified as a nurse in Birmingham. She married Dr Ernest Jones of Aldridge. They lived together at Walmer House where they had 4 sons and Dr Jones became the local Village doctor. Nell and her husband were supporters of the ‘Vote for Women’ movement and carried out many talks in the village on the subject. Dr Jones supported his wife’s connection to Emmeline Pankhurst and when she received a letter detailing that there was a march on Buckingham Palace, May 1914, Nell was encouraged by her husband to attend.\nNell was arrested on Governor Street for damaging the windows of Government buildings. She was sent to Holloway Prison and for 5 days undertook a hunger strike. Nell was not force fed however, she was released as part of the “Cat and Mouse” legislation which sent women on Hunger Strike into respite before continuing their sentence in prison.\nNell, with some other women, fled and returned to Aldridge as a fugitive. Two months later the Great War broke out and Dr Jones opened up the Manor House to care for military personnel, where he and his wife cared for soldiers from the UK and Europe. They received acknowledgments for their hard work and service from the Treasury even though Nell officially remained a ‘fugitive’.",

What’s more, the PCC also plans to close the neighbouring stations at Kingstanding and Sutton Coldfield.\nThis is outrageous. And despite being promised a consultation, the PCC has simply ploughed on with his plans. We deserve better than this.\nAs colleagues at the debate explained, the picture is the same across the West Midlands, and I was pleased our voices and views were able to be shared with the Minister in the House of Commons.\nYou can watch the debate here.",

I have long been a supporter of NCS, and through their participation in the programme young people are able to join together and address the issues that they are passionate about. The programme helps equips them with the skills they need, whilst giving them opportunities to meet new people and experience new challenges. Throughout my visit to the NCS I was impressed by the enthusiasm for the scheme and just how proud everyone was of the work they had done so far and the skills they were developing. Once again I was pleased to see the benefit of NCS on our doorstep this year. |",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-forging-a-new-future-for-britain/content_648.html": "Unsurprisingly Brexit and our future relationship with the EU has once again dominated the political debate around Westminster and just as robust views have echoed around the Cabinet table I am sure many discussions have been held around breakfast tables across the constituency.\nIt is now time to be pragmatic and deliver Brexit for Britain. The British people voted to leave the EU and their will must be respected and that is what we are doing, we are leaving the EU. The Government’s White Paper seeks to respect the outcome of the 2016 EU Referendum allowing us to take back control of our own borders, our money and laws whilst accepting the realities of where we are within our negotiations with the European Union.\nThe White Paper reaffirms the Prime Minister’s commitment that the United Kingdom will leave the EU, including the Single Market and the Customs Union on 29 March 2019. As we leave the EU, free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will come to an end and will allow us to restore the supremacy of British courts. The ending of vast sums of money each year being sent to the EU will also allow the Government to invest further in our domestic priorities such as our long-term plan for the NHS.\nOur Brexit proposal will establish a new European Free Trade area in which we will maintain joint standards on industrial goods and agricultural products ensuring that we have friction-free movement of goods, avoiding a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland and respecting the integrity of the United Kingdom as one United Kingdom. Since the start of the Brexit process the Government have always been clear that we have a unique opportunity to become a truly Global Britain where we operate our own international trade policy. At the same time, the Brexit plan for Britain respects what the Government have heard from businesses about how they want to trade with the EU after we leave and will ensure we are best placed to capitalise on new and emerging markets beyond the EU.\nAs we approach the final stages of these negotiations it is important for us all to remember that whilst we are leaving the European Union, we will not be leaving the continent of Europe. At the same time and as our proud history demonstrates, we will not abandon our friends and allies abroad and we will not retreat from the rest of the world. Closer to home and with summer holidays fast approaching, last weekend was an ideal opportunity to be out and about in Streetly to pop into school garden parties and fayres at Blackwood and St Anne’s and enjoy the fun.

And for the tenth year in a row another freeze in fuel duty saving families money at the pumps will once again be welcomed.\nThe Government’s immediate priority is to stabilise our economy because of the impact of Covid-19. As a result of the hard work of the British people over the last 10-years the foundations of our economy are strong and whilst there will be an impact on our economy the Government stands on the side of families and businesses to support our precious public services, business community and individuals to protect our society from its impact.\nAs we embark upon creating a new ‘Global Britain’ the Budget demonstrates new and sustained investment to deliver on key infrastructure priorities to allow Britain to be a global leader. By backing business, investing in science and research, delivering green growth and investing record sums in our roads, railways and broadband we will increase our productivity at home and extend our reach abroad.\nAt a local level there were several wins for the West Midlands and Aldridge-Brownhills, most notable amongst them was the announcement of a new £400 million brownfield fund for local authorities so that we can protect our precious Green Belt and adopt a ‘Brownfield First’ approach to development.\nThis fund will be extremely important to all of us in Aldridge-Brownhills as we continue to work with Mayor Andy Street to stop speculative and unsuitable development on our precious Green Belt and Open Spaces.\nChanges to business rates in the next financial year to remove businesses with a rateable value of under £51,000 will undoubtedly help our High Streets and Village Centres through challenging times and I will be continuing to press for further investment so that areas such as Brownhills High Street also benefit from other Government funding initiatives.\nAs a Government we are focussed on the ‘People’s Priorities’ and the Budget represents our commitment to all the nations and regions of the United Kingdom with a determination to level up our whole country, deliver on our promises and get the job done for all of the hard working families of Aldridge-Brownhills.",

As the House resumed proceedings, we passed the final stages of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill which will ensure that Britain is fully prepared for leaving the EU in 2019. The legislation now passes to the House of Lords and I very much hope that Peers will respect the outcome of the referendum and honour the bill in its entirety.\nHowever, I am clear, that it is not all about Brexit. Every day the Government are focussed on creating a Britain fit for the future and we have secured important legislation on Smart Meters and Automated and Electric Vehicles in this session.\nThe smart metering implementation programme will allow us to modernise an out dated part of our energy infrastructure. Smart meters are the next generation of metering technology and are an important element of a smarter energy system.\nThe Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill has cleared its final stages in the House of Commons increasing access and availability to charging points for electric vehicles whilst helping us to improve air quality, cut congestion, boost safety and increase the numbers of skilled jobs.\nAll of these are vital pieces of legislation to ensure that we create an economy which works for everyone.\nEqually the Government have actively been supporting a number of Backbench Private Members Bills. I was particularly pleased to support the Stalking Protection Bill which will ensure that there is earlier protection for victims of these terrible crimes. I also felt that the provision that mothers’ names, or second parent names, should be included on marriage and civil partnership certificates, bringing England and Wales into line with Scotland and Northern Ireland after 180-years merited support when put forward by a Conservative Backbencher earlier this month.\nAs we approach the recess I will be out and about across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and as ever I will keep you updated of developments when Parliament returns.",

Whilst extreme in nature, I am keen to ensure that lessons are learned and I will be pressing for follow up action where needed with the relevant authorities and organisations.\nAs a nation of tree lovers, it’s not surprising that caring for our environment is an issue that often lands in my inbox. There is something quite special about growing your own plants or planting something that may be around for years and years to come.\nTo coincide with the recent documentary ‘The Queen’s Green Planet’ in which the Queen spoke about her love for trees and the natural environment I was contacted by the Woodland Trust about the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy initiative.\nThis is a unique initiative across 53 Commonwealth countries to save one of the world’s most important natural habitats – forests. It uses the Commonwealth network to share knowledge and best practice for forest conservation, whilst creating a physical and lasting legacy of The Queen’s leadership of the Commonwealth. As part of the project I have been offered a tree for my constituency.\nAnd so to promote the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy initiative I will shortly be launching a Primary Schools competition. All local Primary Schools across Aldridge-Brownhills, and of course including Streetly, will be invited to enter the competition and they will have the opportunity to win the Queen’s Tree for their school. This will be a great way of engaging with children on the importance of trees and how they benefit our own wellbeing and wider society.\nIn other Parliamentary news, I was very pleased to see the Government’s recent announcement that they intend to bring forward new measures to fine bosses of companies that disturb people with unsolicited nuisance calls. This is an issue which constituents have raised with me and it is really quite astonishing to learn that across the country people were bombarded with more than 3.9 billion nuisance phone calls and texts last year. Nuisance calls are a blight on our society and this announcement signals a determination to put an end to them.\nWith summer approaching I am currently planning a number of pop up ‘Meet your MP’ surgeries across the constituency – an opportunity to meet with you and listen to any concerns and issues you may have. If you are a community group or organisation and are interested then please do drop me an email to wendy.morton.mp@parliament.uk WM Aldridge Office Pic\nThis weekend will bring with it the Streetly Community Association Summer Fayre at Streetly Community Centre on June 9th.

These include the Health Service Medical supplies Bill that seeks to tackle a business model that has allowed the price of some drugs supplied to the NHS to increase by staggering amounts. In one case by an eye-watering 12,000% over 8 years! I also had the opportunity to ask the Prime Minister, Theresa May about the devolution of new powers to the West Midlands Combined Authority and Mayoral elections in 2017.\nIn the year and a half I have represented you as your MP I have grown used to working in the Houses of Parliament – a building known also as the Palace of Westminster. In the early days the challenge was finding my way around, but in spite of that, I have come to love its quirky and curious ways, its corridors and stairways, as well as the beauty of the building.\nFor nearly 1,000 years there has been a Palace on the present site in one form or another, and it became the permanent home of Parliament in 1512. Since that time it has undergone many changes, and the present Gothic building, designed and constructed by Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin, was constructed after the building was destroyed by fire in 1834.\nThis great building – a World Heritage Site – is a part of our Nation’s heritage and attracts over a million visitors a year as well as being at the working heart of our democracy. But now it is in urgent need of repair if it is to be protected for future generations. A joint report by the House of Commons and the House of Lords on the Restoration and Renewal of the Palace has now been produced setting out the preferred proposals. The plan is still to be agreed but it looks likely we shall be vacating for a number of years while essential work is undertaken.\nAs the clocks went back last weekend I was reminded that work is about to begin shortly on Big Ben and the Elizabeth Tower. Big Ben chimes 156 times a day and though I have yet to climb and count them, I am reliably informed that there are a breathtaking 399 steps inside the Tower!\nWhile Big Ben may soon be going silent, the village clock in Pelsall has once again come to life with another stunning display of poppies for Remembrance Day.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-column-5/content_15.html": "Some readers will watch the exchanges across the dispatch box at Prime Ministers Questions and form an impression of a loud, and at times boisterous, House of Commons. This can indeed be true, but as I have expressed through this column on previous occasions, there are also times when Parliament shows a different, more reflective mood.\nThe recent Westminster Hall debate about Brain Tumours and the funding of research was one of those occasions, showing Parliament in a very different light – thoughtful, considered and, at times emotional.\nThe debate was as a result of an E-petition, and a report published in March this year. It is fair to say that for many of us present the report had raised greater awareness and highlighted a limited knowledge about brain tumours and the impact they can have. I was quite shocked to learn that unlike most cancers, the incidence of brain cancer is increasing, and brain tumours kill more children and adults under 40 than any other cancer. There has also been an historical under-funding of research under successive Governments.\nFor every heartbreaking story there is a family affected, there are friends and colleagues too. Many heartbreaking stories were bravely shared during the debate; many of us will know of others affected too.\nCharities, clinicians, and scientists do amazing work, as do local support groups and networks, and I hope to meet the Aldridge group soon. Yet, although technological advances have been made, brain tumours remain very difficult to treat and continue to take lives, too many lives.\nAnd so I was pleased when in his response to the debate the Government Minister acknowledged the powerful case that had been made, accepting more needs to be done and agreeing to look at issues around earlier diagnosis. Specifically, he announced that brain cancer should be included in the Genomics England programme, and suggested setting up a task and finish group at the Department of Health to look at the issues that were raised in the debate, such as trials and off label drugs, as well as research.\nAll round, the first few days back in Parliament after recess have been busy. It was also a week in which Parliament, and indeed across the country, we celebrated HM The Queen’s 90th Birthday. It is an amazing achievement and it was an honour to be in Parliament to listen to the Prime Minister give his humble address and wish Her Majesty a very special 90th birthday.",
  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-building-an-economy-that-works-for-everyone/content_1264.html": "This year’s National Apprenticeship Week once again celebrated apprentices and apprenticeships, and the positive impact they have on individuals, business, local communities and the wider economy. I have always been a big supporter of apprentices and apprenticeships and so I was particularly pleased to be able to welcome some local apprentices and businesses to Parliament recently, together with Aldridge based In-Comm Training.\nApprenticeships are initially important to those undertaking them because they provide the skills and training, to progress and succeed. They are also really important to local businesses and employers to enable them to develop and shape the workforce for today and the future. Many of today’s apprentices will be tomorrow’s inventors, engineers and carers. That’s why I support them.\nRecent economic figures have shown that unemployment stands at a new 40-year low. The hard work of this Government to eradicate the deficit continues, but with improved economic growth and the highest number of first time buyers for more than a decade we are building a Britain which is fit for the future where the economy works for all hard-working families.\nHaving come from a small business background myself I know all too well small businesses and manufacturers are driving economic growth, job creation and wage security in our local area. I was therefore pleased to be joined by representatives from our local business community at recent my Constituency Business Breakfast. This gave me the opportunity to hear first-hand about the challenges and opportunities for businesses in our area and what further steps the Government can take to encourage continued growth.\nThroughout our discussions it was clear that local businesses welcome the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech in which she set out an ambitious and serious vision for our future economic partnership with the European Union after Brexit.\nThe Government’s objective is clear – it is to deliver the real change that the country voted for in June 2016 whilst protecting jobs, our economy and our security. The Prime Minister has set out in a very pragmatic way that we are getting on with delivering what the British people voted for and we are taking back control of our Laws, our Borders and our Money.\nIn spite of the recent heavy snowfall, it has once again been a busy few weeks locally too. I was delighted to join members of the Shelfield Male Voice Choir at their 50th Anniversary Celebrations. The Male Voice Choir has provided endless entertainment over the years and their charitable donations have helped many charities throughout the local area. They are to be congratulated on this magnificent achievement. I was also pleased to call in and meet with Jan Davies and users of the Brownhills CA, another much valued local organisation celebrating a special anniversary this year. The Community Association has been designated as an Asset of Community Value, recognising the importance of the Centre to Brownhills.

Their impact is huge, and even the smallest contributions can collectively make as big difference. The local Aldridge Volunteer Gardeners, together with all those who have collectively been working as part of the In Bloom team, are an excellent example. Their hard work and effort is to be admired and commended and I wish them all the best in this years competition. Whatever the outcome, and we will have to wait until later in the year to hear, I am sure we can all agree that the Village looks splendid once again this year, and it shows community spirit at its finest.\nIt is therefore frustrating that across our area we continue to suffer the incursions of Travellers who do not share this respect for neighbours and the local environment, leaving behind a trail of rubbish and mess for others to clean up. This is a matter I have raised both locally and at Westminster and will continue to do so as quite clearly more needs to be done to tackle this issue.\nIt may be recess but there is still much to do and much going on. The four Black Country Authorities including, Walsall Council, have recently commenced their Black Country Core Strategy Consultation. It is a document essentially about planning for our future, including Housing, Employment, Environment and Transport.\nImportantly for us, the consultation looks at housing needs up to 2036, and seeks to identify future growth areas within the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency. I have always taken the view that we need a ‘Brownfield first’ approach to housing and development, allowing us to protect our precious Green Belt. It is absolutely vital that the views of residents from right across the constituency are heard. If you want to take part in the consultation it runs up to 8 September and details can be found at: www.blackcountrycorestrategy.dudley.gov.uk\nLocally the decision by Walsall Council to buy the Sadler Centre in Walsall town centre for the staggering sum of £13.8 million when earlier this summer the Council closed the doors of libraries in Pelsall, Rushall and Walsall Wood and have failed to provide any strategy or vision for Ravenscourt in Brownhills, demonstrates a breath-taking lack of reality of the needs of residents in our area. It is now incumbent on Walsall Council to develop a strategy for action on Brownhills High Street.\nThis was first published by the Walsall Advertiser on 17th August 2017.",

I have always been clear in my mind that whatever the decision of the British people at the Referendum on 23rd June last year it would be for Government to honour that, something which I reiterated when I spoke in Parliament last week and voted in favour of allowing the Government to Trigger Article 50.\nRecent weeks have brought other important announcements too including proposals from the Prime Minister for a modern Industrial Strategy – backing Britain for the long term, enabling businesses to grow and create more high skilled, high paid jobs. It includes investing in science, research and innovation and upgrading infrastructure – all of which is vital as we move forward to exit the EU and seize the opportunity to seek out new relationships and new opportunities. Focussing and developing on our strengths and skills will be a key part of this, preparing Britain for the fundamental challenges we face both now and in the future, and building on our strengths as we seek to extend excellence into the future.\nWe continue to see that the NHS is facing a number of challenges with an ageing population and patients living longer, often with multiple long-term health conditions and increasing patient expectations. To meet these challenges we need to look at how care is delivered in the future. I am pleased to see that locally NHS Walsall Clinical Commissioning Group is launching The Big Conversation to work together with local people to ensure we have high quality, sustainable services that are affordable and fit for the future. If you live locally they want to listen to you and discuss the future delivery of health services – urgent care, stroke services, GP services and community services such as district nursing, physiotherapy and podiatry. They have launched a series of meetings as part of their ‘Big Conversation’, these meetings will be taking place between the 2nd and 7th of March at various locations around Aldridge-Brownhills. if you’re interested in attending and want to book your place you can by telephoning 01922 603054 or emailing ccgcomms@walsall.nhs.uk\nIn closing, I can’t end the week without a comment on vegetables – lettuce and courgettes to be more specific!

The attack in Salisbury demonstrated the strength of the Prime Minister’s resolve to uphold that principle.\nThe Russian threat does not respect borders and as such has posed a risk to us all. The Government is therefore taking steps, within the rule of law, to protect our country and to ensure that this flagrant breach of international law is never repeated.\nTurning to the Treasury and matters financial, the Chancellors Spring Statement demonstrated that the Government is taking a balanced approach as we build an economy that works for everyone. We have invested over £60 billion since 2016, in public services and in building the infrastructure for the future, while continuing to cut tax for millions of working families.\nThe UK has come a long way over the last eight years, with our economy growing strongly, unemployment at a near-record low, the deficit down and more investment in public services like the NHS which is to be welcomed.\nWhilst public sector pay restraint was necessary to tackle the deficit left by the last Labour Government, in September last year we ended the 1 per cent pay award policy for public sector workforces, recognising that the economy has started to turn the corner.\nThe Health Secretary has now set out proposals that will see pay rises of at least 6.5 per cent for over 1.1 million NHS workers in England including nurses and midwives, as part of a package of reform to boost productivity for the benefit of all patients. This Health Secretary will also announce the largest ever increase in NHS midwives and maternity support staff with a plan to train more than 3000 extra midwives over 4 years.\nThe Ministry of Justice have now unveiled the Civil Liability Bill, offering potential lower insurance premiums to millions of motorists. The number of whiplash claims has been too high for too long. The Civil Liability Bill will put this right by ensuring whiplash claims are no longer an easy payday – putting money back in the pockets of millions of law-abiding motorists.\nAs we approach the Easter recess I look forward to being out and about across my Aldridge-Brownhills constituency and as ever I will keep you updated of developments when Parliament returns in April",

The decision has been undertaken without proper consultation and comes on the back of receiving increased funding from the Government in the recent funding settlement.

It was therefore a great pleasure to be able to welcome a group of apprentices from Aldridge based In-Comm Training and Business Services to the House of Commons. This built on the success of a similar visit they made last year and once again they showcased how apprenticeships work for individuals, businesses, communities and the wider economy.\nOn a more social level I was delighted to join members of the Shelfield Male Voice Choir at their recent 50th Anniversary Celebrations.

In his statement the Chancellor of the Exchequer outlined the Government’s priorities including an additional £750 million to recruit 20,000 new Police Officers and, on top of the biggest ever cash boost given to the NHS this April, last week he announced a further £1 billion for adult social care. There was also the very welcome news of three years of investment to properly fund our schools, with an additional £2.6 billion next year and raising to £7.1 billion by 2022-23.\nA great education is fundamental to the success of children, their families and our communities, as well as the success of our country. The additional investment in education will benefit every school and I am particularly pleased to see significant gains for the lowest funded schools including several in the Constituency. This funding commitment will ensure every secondary school receives at least £5,000 per pupil, and every primary school at least £3,750 per pupil next year.\nIt is good to see the Government are taking an holistic approach to funding education across the board with an additional £700 million to support children with special educational needs and an extra £400 million to provide more resources for 16-19 year olds particularly focusing on skills vital for productivity, including engineering and construction.\nTurning to local matters, I remain increasingly concerned about the future of Aldridge Police Station. Since the announcement last year by the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) to close and dispose of our local police station in Aldridge I have campaigned against this. Such a proposal is unacceptable to residents and is unacceptable to me as your Member of Parliament. As things currently stand Aldridge Police Station is due to close in a matter of months and yet the PCC appears to be no further forward in identifying sites for a continued local police presence. Aldridge and our wider community need to maintain a local Police base and presence.\nWith this in mind, I was therefore pleased to hear that one of our Neighbourhood Watch groups has launched a petition to Keep Aldridge Police Station open and I would encourage you all to sign this. You can sign the petition by going to: http://chng.it/22qrN8SH8p\nLast Friday saw my first Aldridge-Brownhills Seniors’ Fair.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_the-green-belt-matters-to-aldridge-brownhills/content_218.html": "Significant parts of my constituency, and many of our local communities, such as Streetly, are defined by Green Belt and precious green open spaces. Sadly, they are increasingly coming under threat.\nResidents in Streetly were recently alerted to a development proposal called Columba Park that has outlined the potential for 1,500 new homes on land on Queslett Road East, adjacent to Aldridge Road. This is being conceived as part of The Black Country Core Strategy that is preparing Walsall’s housing requirements up until 2036.\nWhilst at this stage there is no planning application, it does raise the need for us to start to mobilise ourselves towards defending our precious Green Belt and open spaces when needed. With this in mind I want to see the Black Country Core Strategy changed and I am going to need your help to achieve that change. For me the Green Belt is not a nostalgic vision of an old England of bygone years. Today’s Green Belt keeps inappropriate development at bay. It defines the identity of our local communities and in Streetly’s case it stops us being subsumed into a Greater Birmingham.\nWhilst I freely accept more housing is needed, it seems to me that in the rush to provide more homes, a core function of the planning system is being lost – the ability to provide the right homes in the right places for people who need them. This is why, alongside Andy Street, Mayor of the West Midlands, I have always advocated a brownfield first approach to development.\nSo, this summer I will be contacting residents and campaigning across Streetly and my wider Aldridge-Brownhills constituency to ensure that you know about the Black Country Core Strategy. I will be encouraging constituents to make their views known that we will not countenance development on our Green Belt. The Green Belt is non-negotiable.\nTogether, we must make a stand for future generations and seek a different approach by insisting The Black Country Core Strategy switches its emphasis to developing brownfield sites first and not developing our precious green and open spaces.\nLocal residents have also contacted me with their concerns about Birmingham City Council’s proposal to take down Perry Barr fly-over.\nThe Council are proposing to remove the A34 Perry Barr fly-over, putting all traffic on to a dual carriageway at ground level. This will have a huge impact on many residents in Streetly and beyond.\nI do not believe the basis for the decision to remove the Perry Barr fly-over is a sound one. Indeed Birmingham City Council’s own technical report highlights that the proposal to remove the fly-over would actually make traffic flow worse, not to mention the increased disruption it is going to cause to a large number of residents. Whilst we all welcome our status as host region for the Commonwealth Games and realise that construction work will have to be undertaken, I am concerned that rather than leaving a lasting benefit of the Games, the legacy of this particular proposal will be an on-going headache for commuters from across Streetly.\nThe consultation closes on 19th July and I would encourage residents to make their views known www.birminghambeheard.org.uk/economy/a34perrybarr/, as indeed I will. It was extremely disappointing to see the adverse weather conditions prevent the Streetly Summer Festival from taking place earlier this month. I appreciate how hard the Streetly Sports and Community Association worked to prepare this year’s festival and they deserve our thanks.\nThis article was first published in the Royal Sutton Observer on Friday 21st June 2019",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-return-visit-to-sierra-leone/content_455.html": "Across the world today, we are seeing humanitarian crises, refugees in desperate need of help and protection, as well as unprecedented levels of population movement. We are seeing fragile states become more fragile, and the impact of conflict is often felt way beyond the boundaries of the area or country affected. We need to continue to find ways to tackle this, including the provision of Humanitarian aid at times of crisis, whilst increasing resilience and seeking to move away from aid dependency.\nIt was back in 2013 that I first travelled to Sierra Leone. At that time the country was seeking to become a transformed nation with middle-income status whilst continuing to tackle post-conflict high youth unemployment, corruption and weak national cohesion, as well as poverty and poor infrastructure.\nSince then an outbreak of the Ebola virus has hit the country, claiming the lives of over 11,300 people, devastating families and communities and health and economic systems.\nDuring the Ebola crisis DfiD delivered vital UKaid, and British troops were also deployed to help, providing assistance on the ground. Now in the post Ebola phase the focus and support is on recovery and rebuilding – but not just on health systems and the economy but families and communities too.\nReturning in September this year, almost a year since the country was declared Ebola free on 7th November 2015, I wanted to see and understand better for myself how the country is going about its recovery. Interestingly this began even before the plane landed at Freetown as I chatted to a grandmother returning to her home country for the first time in three years, looking forward to meeting her new grandchild. It was a humble reminder of the wider impact this terrible virus has had.\nIn country I was fortunate to meet with a number of international charities and organisations including VSO, and Restless Development as well as meeting with Ebola survivors. On a visit to Kissy Bomeh dumpsite with social workers from Street Child I met Ebola orphans and families being helped to engage in work, set up their own micro businesses and get their children into school.\nAn early start, and some volunteering with Lunch Box Gift, a charity formed in response to the Ebola crisis was followed by a visit to Evans Primary School set up with help from SWATS to provide an education to some of the most vulnerable. Many of these children are orphans adopted by local families and for whom without this school the likelihood is they would receive little or no education at all.\nMuch has been done, but there is still much to do. Like many developing countries Sierra Leone faces a learning crisis. More children are in school, yet too many are not learning. Health care systems need rebuilding and strengthening. Jobs and livelihoods need developing. The need for assistance and support remains.",
  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_protection-at-home-protection-abroad-the-key-priorities/content_384.html": "Throughout the summer residents from across Aldridge-Brownhills have been repeatedly plagued by a series of Unauthorised Traveller Encampments, the latest of which has been yet another incursion at Aldridge Airport. Last year Walsall Council took some steps towards ending the upset and frustration caused to residents as a result of these encampments – the noise and anti-social behaviour, and the rubbish and mess so often left behind. However, this summer we have reached breaking point.\nI have always been clear that whilst the measures taken by Walsall Council last year were a help, much more still needed to be done and I promised that I would raise the matter in Parliament at the earliest opportunity, this I have done after persistent lobbying and the Government have now made time to discuss these matters when the House returns in October.\nThis will provide an opportunity to look at the powers available to local Councils and the Police and, most importantly, how these repeated encampments impact on local communities like ours.\nI will of course be reporting back to residents on this, it is now also incumbent on Walsall Council to seek the much talked about Borough-wide injunction. Protection of all my constituents must be paramount and we must bring to an end these Unauthorised Encampments on our precious Green and Open Spaces. Enough is enough. Residents want action.\nOn the wider political front, the Prime Minister’s bold speech in Florence last week about Britain’s exit from the European Union has built on her Lancaster House speech earlier in the year, demonstrating the Government’s commitment to deliver on the referendum result and beginning the process of creating a truly ‘Global Britain’ post 2019. Central to these objectives was the Government releasing their proposal for a future partnership with the EU on Defence and Security.\nThe first duty of a Government is to keep its people safe and since becoming a Member of Parliament I have always supported legislation which has strengthened our Armed Forces and the defence of our country. I was therefore pleased that over the summer the Government made a series of announcements which strengthen the security of the nation.\nOur renewed commitment to spending 2% of our GDP on Defence together with the recent launch of the new Aircraft Carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, the biggest and most complex warship ever built for the Royal Navy are to be welcomed combined with the announcement of the National Shipbuilding Strategy this further demonstrates that this Government is determined to meet the challenges with which we are faced around the world.\nThis was first published by the Walsall Advertiser and the Sutton Observer on 29th September 2017.",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_covid-19/content_718.html": "Dear Aldridge-Brownhills Resident,\nThe following statement has been issued by the Secretary of State for Health & Social Care concerning the on-going Coronavirus outbreak. As a community I know we will rise to the challenge, but one of the most important things is that we shield those most at risk from the virus.\nI am working with my members of staff and Councillors to organise a volunteer phone buddy system to help constituents who go into self-isolation. As we are now entering the delay phase of the coronavirus it will require a large number of people in our local communities to self-isolate to prevent a further spread of the virus.\nSelf-isolation from this virus will, for many people, become the hardest stage of this process. No one across our community should face that alone.\nYours sincerely,\nWendy Morton\nStatement from the Secretary of State for Health – The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP – (Sunday 15th March 2020)\nThe coronavirus outbreak is the biggest public health emergency in a generation.\nIt calls for dramatic action, at home and abroad, of the kind not normally seen in peacetime.\nOur goal is clear. The over-riding objective is to protect life. Sadly 21 people have already died in the UK, and the fact that most had underlying health conditions does not make the grief of their families any lesser, nor our compassion for their family and friends any weaker. We must all do everything in our power to tackle this virus.\nWe have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy. Our goal is to protect life from this virus, our strategy is to protect the most vulnerable and protect the NHS through contain, delay, research and mitigate.\nWe are working through our clear action plan. Like all our decisions, the plan is based on the bedrock of the science, with maximum transparency. We will do the right thing at the right time, based on the best available science.\nTo protect life, we must protect the vulnerable, and protect the NHS and flatten the curve.\nFrom the moment coronavirus emerged, we have followed those goals.\nWe have acted to contain the spread of the virus so far. We have carried out some of the highest number of tests in Europe, our surveillance testing is among the most sophisticated in the world and the UK’s plans for the rapid response to and mitigation of the spread of an epidemic are ranked number one above any other country by the Global Health Security Index. Most importantly of all, thanks to our record levels of tracing the number of people who came into contact with the first people who caught the virus, the initial growth was slowed significantly, and the growth of the virus in the UK has been slower than many major European countries. This action has already prevented the NHS being put under greater pressure in its hardest season of the year. We have bought valuable time to prepare.\nLast week we stepped into the next phase of our response. We took action to advise anyone with symptoms, however mild, to stay at home. This advice from the Chief Medical Officer will be reinforced with a national communications campaign so everyone knows what they can do: how you can play your part. The new campaign will set out the latest clinical advice, for people to stay at home for seven days if they develop a high temperature or new continuous cough. We can all keep doing our bit by continuing to wash our hands more often, for 20 seconds or more and having plenty of tissues around to ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’. Following this new advice may sound simple, but it could be lifesaving for others around us, especially the most vulnerable.\nToday, we take further action, with a call to arms for a drive to build the ventilators and other equipment the NHS will need. We are better equipped thanks to the NHS than most other countries, but we will need many more. We now need any manufacturers to transform their production lines to make ventilators. We cannot make too many.\nIn the near future we will take further steps. SAGE has advised the next planned effective interventions will need to be instituted soon, including measures to ‘shield’ older and medically vulnerable people from the virus. Everyone will need to help to ensure they get the support they need to stay at home, and to protect them from the consequences of isolation: loneliness, and a lack of support. Government, local councils, charities, friends and neighbours will need to be part of the national effort to support the shielded. We will provide expert advice and support as soon as we progress to this phase.\nNext week we will publish our emergency bill, to give the Government the temporary powers we will need to help everyone get through this. The measures in it allow for the worst case scenario. I hope many of them won’t be needed. But we will ask Parliament for these powers in case they are.\nOur generation has never been tested like this. Our grandparents were, during the Second World War, when our cities were bombed during the Blitz. Despite the pounding every night, the rationing, the loss of life, they pulled together in one gigantic national effort.\nToday our generation is facing its own test, fighting a very real and new disease. We must fight the disease to protect life. Everyone will be asked to make sacrifices, to protect themselves and others, especially those most vulnerable to this disease. With our clear action plan, listening to the advice of the best science, and taking the action we all must, I am sure we will rise to this challenge.",

This piece of legislation is the single most significant matter under consideration in this Parliament. The EU (Withdrawal) Bill is fundamental to ensuring that we have a smooth and orderly Brexit that will work for all hard working families across Aldridge-Brownhills.\nThe legislation will repeal the European Communities Act from our statute book. In our future relationship, our laws will once again be made in Westminster, not in Brussels; and the judges interpreting those laws will sit in British courts, not in Luxembourg courts and on the face of the Bill is the date of our departure from the European Union: the United Kingdom will be leaving the EU on 29th March 2019 at 11pm.\nI will be supporting Prime Minister, Theresa May and the Government on this legislation because the EU (Withdrawal) Bill will provide certainty and allow us to begin paving the way for a ‘Global Britain’ where we will be able to look beyond the continent of Europe and begin to embrace the opportunities of the wider world with new friends and old allies alike. Residents from across my constituency have always been clear that they want Parliament to get on with the job and secure a Brexit Deal which works for everyone.\nIt is vital for the prosperity and security of our nation to secure the best possible Brexit for our country’s future and as your Member of Parliament I will continue to play my part to ensure this outcome.",

With this years IWA Festival of Water being held in Pelsall last weekend it was the perfect excuse, if ever we needed one, to take to the waters of Aldridge-Brownhills. Aided by a crew whose enthusiasm made up for any lack of skills, even when a carrier bag found itself tangled around the propshaft, we headed from Huddlesford, through the Rushall Locks and on to Brownhills before reaching Pelsall for the Festival.\nTravelling along the canals the contrast between countryside and industrial heritage, traditional and modern day Britain is striking. Whether on board, or walking the towpath there’s more to boating than a slow passage across the water – cheeky moorhens, beady-eyed Herons on watch, canoeists in Brownhills there is always plenty to see. Passing Rushall Locks and Longwood the sign never fails to amuse me “Cruising time to the Houses of Parliament 10 days!” Maximum speed 4 miles per hour. I am not convinced the new Chief Whip would be too pleased if I chose to commute by canal boat each week to Parliament!\nThe first gathering of the IWA Festival of Water on Pelsall North Common was held in 1987 and since then they have returned on a number of occasions. This year I was delighted to be invited to join the Chairman in opening the event, and it marked the start of an excellent weekend.\nMoving from water to wheels, but still reminiscent of the midlands manufacturing heritage I recently went to the Aldridge Transport Museum for the launch of their Wealth of Heritage” project which is aimed at encouraging schools from the area to visit and learn more about local history. Looking around the museum one of my favourites was certainly the 1950’s ice cream van, though the red London bus was a very close second. Right on our doorstep in Aldridge it is entirely self-funded and run by volunteers. If you haven’t been before its open Tuesdays, Saturdays and Sundays and is well worth a visit.\nAs school holidays and recess draw to an end, and we welcome back to the UK from Rio 2016 Team GB with a record number of Olympic medals, I know readers will want to join me in also wishing our Paralympians all the best too in their Games which start on 7th September.\nNew school years about to begin, for some there are new courses at college and University to look towards.

This, combined with another freeze in fuel duty saving families more money at the pumps is to be welcomed.\nWith more people than ever using our National Health Service the Government have backed their words with action and have committed a cash injection to support our precious National Health Service. Under the Government’s plan, NHS funding will grow year on year and by 2023-24 by £20.5 billion in real terms compared with today. That means there will be £394 million a week of additional resource in real terms supporting our precious NHS. The Government also committed an additional £650 million in grant funding to support Social Care which will go directly to our local Councils and additional support for the magnificent work undertaken by the Air Ambulance.\nWalsall Council will also benefit from a share of the £420 million additional investment to combat potholes and new monies to upgrade local roads across our area. This combined with more than £20 billion of investment to our major motorways will help ensure that we are keeping Britain moving.\nI was also particularly interested that calls from our High Streets and small businesses have been heard and listened to by The Chancellor. By cutting business rates by a third and outlining a new ‘Future High Streets Fund’ supported with £675 million of additional resources to help transform our High Streets, I really hope to see this benefit our High Streets across Aldridge-Brownhills, as well as to see change at Ravens Court in Brownhills.\nThe Government remain focussed on ensuring that we create a Britain that works for everyone. Today’s Budget is another important step towards achieving our ambitions for Britain and repays all the hard work of taxpayers since the financial crisis, delivering a budget for all hard-working families across Aldridge-Brownhills.",

The terrible and despicable events in Paris highlighted this threat even more, and brought with it the reminder to us all that the first duty of any Government is to protect its country and its citizens.\nI know that we recognize and appreciate the service and dedication of our Armed Forces and the security services, and we are reminded of the brave work of the men and women, and sacrifices they make on a daily basis to keep us safe and secure.\nOver Christmas and New Year we saw and read about households, families and businesses affected by severe and continuous downpour of rains in Yorkshire and the North West. Although we are fortunate in this constituency not to be among those directly affected, many will have families and friends who have suffered badly. Many more could not fail to be touched by these dreadful events, and we have seen examples of community spirit coming together to assist, including locally in Pelsall where practical assistance in the form of a collection of cleaning materials, is being led by Councillor Garry Perry.\nOnce again, we are reminded of the incredible work of our uniform and emergency services, local police, fire and ambulance services, some of whom often deploy to other areas to assist in times of need. Our doctors and our nurses too who work throughout the year. The dedication and public service they provide truly deserves our thanks and appreciation.\nLooking to 2016 I am sure there will be many challenges ahead. However we have a Government committed to overcoming these, whilst also ensuring the economic recovery of the country continues, as well as providing opportunity and security for all.\nI will continue to progress my Private Members Bill to help Great Ormond Street Childrens Hospital Charity, and work hard to serve all my constituents and communities.\nParliament resumes on January 5th and my first constituency surgery for 2016 will be held in Aldridge on January 8th.

Phew! And so, the NHS (Charitable Trusts Etc) bill, more fondly known in my office as the “Peter Pan & Wendy Bill” has reached the House of Lords where it will be considered on 26th February. Fingers crossed its passage continues unopposed to Royal Assent rather than to Never Land.\nIt has been a busy few weeks in the House of Commons and as I have learned very quickly since being elected, it is just not possible to attend everything you would like to! However, I have been able to raise issues with Ministers on a range of matters and most recently contributed to a debate on the importance to us locally of our precious greenbelt, something that really adds to the sense of community and identity we enjoy in and around Aldridge-Brownhills and Streetly. I also raised the issue of national security and our commitment to maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent. As the wife of a former serving member of HM Forces I need no reminding that national security is the first duty of any Government and must always remain a priority.\nBack in the constituency at the end of the week I was delighted to be joined by the Prime Minister’s Advisor for Apprenticeships, Nadhim Zahawi, MP for Stratford upon Avon, to discuss apprenticeships with local businesses, over breakfast at Simply Delicious. Having spent most of my working life in the family electronics and manufacturing business, I am a firm believer in enterprise and entrepreneurship and I back the drive for more apprenticeships, and the on going development of the Midlands region as the Engine for Growth. Since 2010 over 4000 apprenticeships have been started across my constituency and it is great to see these figures. I am keen to see more opportunities for apprenticeships, so that young people are able to earn and learn, and gain skills locally, and so that local businesses can benefit too.\nWith the Enterprise Bill currently passing through Parliament it was useful to meet up with some of our local businesses. It is absolutely vital that we cement the UKs position as the best places to start and grow a business, and to make sure there are opportunities to work hard and succeed and that means local opportunities for local people across Aldridge-Brownhills.",

Indeed, Birmingham City Council’s own technical report highlights that the proposal to remove the flyover would actually make traffic flow worse, not to mention the disruption it is going to cause everyone concerned.\nI am sure we all welcome the Commonwealth Games coming to Birmingham in 2022 and the lasting legacy it will create for our region too. However, whilst this understandably means construction work will have to be undertaken I remain concerned that the proposal to remove the Perry Barr flyover will leave not a lasting local benefit, but an on-going headache for commuters from across Streetly and beyond.\nFor 2-years I have been campaigning against the Police and Crime Commissioner’s plan to close a raft of local Police Stations including Aldridge and Sutton Coldfield. With Police and Crime Commissioner elections taking place on 7th May I am pleased that the outgoing Commissioner has, for now at least, announced a moratorium on his decision and no final decision to close the Police Stations serving Streetly will be made until after the election. That said, our campaign to retain them must continue.\nLocal police stations are at the very heart of responsive community policing. At a time when we have secured millions of pounds of extra police funding, it would be wrong that we would be left without a single station on our side of the borough.\nOur local area, with its distinct character, needs a proper police station embedded in the community and I will continue to campaign for this.\nLast Friday, at 11pm on the 31st January, Great Britain and Northern Ireland formally left the European Union. As your Member of Parliament, I voted to support the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill and respect the outcome of the 2016 EU Referendum when 68% of residents from across Aldridge-Brownhills voted to leave.\nBy honouring the 2016 EU Referendum we now have a unique opportunity to work with new friends and old allies alike, whilst focusing on a strong domestic agenda and your priorities.\nThis article first appeared in the Sutton Observer on Friday 7 February 2020",

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_a-view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-column/content_379.html": "My background before I entered Parliament was in business, and for almost 25 years I worked for and with small businesses, including the optical industry and our own family electronics and manufacturing firm. It will therefore come as no surprise that I am a supporter of enterprise and entrepreneurship, and that’s because I believe it is fundamental to the British Economy and the success of our local area, as well as being part of the Midlands Engine for growth.\nWhether it’s manufacturing, retail, engineering, catering, hairdressing or one of many other sectors, our small businesses are the backbone of our local economy and they are vital to our local communities. They are often a key part of the local town and village centres that we value so much, bringing a good balance and variety of independent shops and businesses to the High Street.\nOver the last three years we have seen the development of Small Business Saturday. Organised for the first shopping Saturday of December it is the UKs most successful small business campaign, focussing on local businesses and raising awareness of what we have right on our doorstep. Christmas is a good time to shop local but to keep our High Streets vibrant we must remember the importance of shopping local all year round.\nMy “Small Business Saturday” began with an early visit to the Herbarium in Aldridge, arriving just before the daily delivery of fresh flowers. It was then on to Oakdene Nursery in Streetly before I headed to see Harjit and Jodie Singh at their Nisa Convenience store in High Heath and then Kind Thoughts in Pelsall where I was particularly impressed with the Christmas Baubles, painted to depict local scenes. A great gift idea and something which will be on my tree when I get time to decorate it! The day was rounded off with a very welcome cup of coffee and a delicious mince pie at the Coffee House in Brownhills.\nThe Government’s Enterprise Bill is due to complete its stages in the House of Lords on the 15th December and will then be debated by the House of Commons. Three key features are; the establishment of a Small Business Commissioner, reform the business rates appeal system, give statutory underpinning to apprenticeships and require insures to pay insurance claims within a reasonable time.\nAt this time of year no week would be complete without a few Christmas events and last weekend was no exception. Stunning displays of Christmas Trees and twinkling fairy lights at Aldridge Methodist Church, and All Saints Parish Church in Streetly, left me feeling inspired and thinking I need to be more creative with my decorating next year! And even a damp start to Sunday did not dampen the festive spirit at the Pelsall Frost Fayre.",

Do we stay in or do we leave? Has the Prime Minister secured sufficient for us to remain an independent nation within a European Union?\nThere are emotional as well as economic arguments for and against the special status that has been secured and we must each consider what it is we want for ourselves, our families and our country.\nIt was the Keep the Pound campaign back in 2001 that got me involved in politics. I felt so strongly that the Great British Pound was, and indeed still is, a part of our Britishness and the thought of it being replaced by something called a Euro was inconceivable. I still feel that way today and that is why I am relieved that the Prime Minister has been able to secure a special status for our country so that we will never join the Euro. Our own currency is a physical as well as symbolic reminder of our independent as a nation. I dread to think how we might be today had we joined the Euro.\nFor too long the EU has been drifting towards a superstate, with powers ebbing away from us. Europe has grown in size from the original 6 members states to total of 28 today. It has become much more about political unity and federalism as rather than economic unity upon which it was formed. I have felt our sovereignty has been slowly undermined. For me the EU in its current form, is no longer an option. We are not the United States of Europe, we are a union of individual countries, with a number mutual interests and goals and as such we should be able to work and negotiate towards common ground.\nAs a business person I completely understand the arguments that doing business in Europe is easier now than it was thanks to the free trade single market, but the amount of gold-plated red tape stemming from Brussels is a frustration we could easily do without.\nIn terms of economy and defence we are a strong nation. The threats to world security and peace have changed immeasurably since the EU was formed, and I believe Britain should continue to rightly play its part in the world whether we vote to remain or leave. We have a duty to do so. We are part of the UN, NATO, the Commonwealth, and have a well-respected diplomatic presence around the world.\nOver the next few weeks we will all learn more about the details of the agreement, and I will be seeking assurances that it can not be undermined or circumnavigated by other Member States. Like many of you I want to know the facts before I decide how to cast my vote. My commitment to my constituents is to do everything I can to ensure that they have the information they want to make up their own minds as I will decide my view. It is a national referendum, not a parliamentary vote. My views and vote carries no more weight than anyone else reading this paper.\nOnce the result is know it will then be for Parliament to implement the will of the people.",

Children from St Francis Catholic Primary School and Greenfields Primary School had made some fabulous handmade decorations and there were worthy winners from both schools.

Over the last 12 months I have spent 15 days with the Royal Navy gaining a deeper understanding of Defence and current military issues, and it has been an absolute privilege to visit some of the Naval bases and ships and to meet with servicemen and women.\nOne of the highlights has undoubtedly been spending a day on board HMS Portland while she was at sea, and also experiencing arctic survival training with the Royal Marines in Norway. A visit to see the new aircraft carriers under construction in Scotland was also memorable, as indeed was my visit to the Fleet Diving Squadron, albeit for very different reasons: not least having to wrestle my way out of a wet suit!\nThe AFPS is an excellent way for MPs to learn through spending time alongside service personnel.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-westminster-local-newspaper-column-4/content_1124.html": "Returning home to Aldridge-Brownhills at the weekend, I reflected on a week which had begun with Acts of Remembrance at Aldridge and Walsall Wood, and ended with a visit to Aldridge School to see the superb display of hand-made ceramic poppies to commemorate those who served and gave their lives for our country. Communities all across my constituency from Brownhills to Pelsall, Rushall to Streetly, came together to remember those who served our country, and fought for the freedoms we have today.\nThat peace of Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day was shattered by last weekend’s atrocities in Paris. Our thoughts at Westminster are for the injured and the bereaved families of the victims of last Friday, and for the people of France.\nBritain too has suffered in the past. Attacks on the London’s Underground and buses and also Glasgow Airport. No doubt in the coming days and weeks there will be reviews of our local and national security. They should all be viewed in a careful and measured way. The overriding priority must be the security of our country and its people.\nRegular readers of my “View from Westminster” may recall me recently writing about the Private Members Bill I am seeking to take through Parliament, and which if successful, will secure the Royalties from JM Barrie’s Peter Pan publications and productions for the new Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital Charity.\nI am now able to report back that the Bill passed through the Chamber unopposed at Second Reading last week. It now passes to the next stage of its journey through Parliament and on to Committee, for scrutiny. Committee work may sound dull, but from my experience, this can be far from the case. A huge amount of work to scrutinise, and amend the Governments legislative programme is done in committee. Private Members Bills are no exception and they too are scrutinised in this way.\nHospital Charities do outstanding work both locally and across the country, and we should do all we can do support them, so I am delighted my “Peter Pan” Bill is making progress. It has a long way to go including the formal stages of review in the House of Lords. As a Private Members’ Bill it must complete all stages within this session of Parliament that ends with the summer recess. It will only succeed if it has cross party support in both the Commons and the Lords.\nSelect Committees are another form of scrutiny, looking specifically at government policy and wider topics like the economy, justice, and transport. They hold Government to account and set up specific enquiries, where witnesses are asked to attend and provide evidence and expert testimony. I sit on the International Development Select Committee where our role is to scrutinise the work of the Department for International Development. We are currently considering and taking evidence on the Government’s response to the Syrian Refugee crisis, as well as how the UK responded to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. On these issues, like all others we scrutinise, reports will be drawn up and the Government will be expected to respond.\nYou will have gathered from this week’s column that good oversight and scrutiny is a major part of my work and this can only come with the full appraisal of facts and information.\nYou too may follow my work and the work of parliament on the Parliamentary website: www.parliament.uk",

Now in its 12th year there are events taking place in Parliament and beyond, and I will be making a return visit to a local apprenticeship provider based here in my own constituency.\nSkills and apprenticeships are something I have long been a big supporter of, and there is nothing like hearing from young people about their experiences and their achievements. The spectrum of apprenticeships is now wide reaching, extending well beyond what was traditionally on offer, and providing many more opportunities. With our strong manufacturing base in the West Midlands apprenticeships are also a key part of growing our skills base for the future.\nLocally in my own constituency I have seen and discussed the success of apprenticeships at first hand, through meeting some of our local employers as well as Aldridge based In-Comm Training and Business Services. It is always good to hear from local businesses about the continued benefits of apprenticeships and they are to be congratulated for their willingness to invest time and money into their apprentices. Without their continued investment the skills gap would be much wider.\nWith recent economic figures showing that wages have risen at their fastest pace in 10 years and employment has reached a record high, we should recognise the role of local employers and businesses, both large and small, in helping to achieve this. Across Aldridge-Brownhills unemployment continues to fall and stands 60% lower than in April 2010. This is to be welcomed.\nHaving come from a small business background myself I know all too well how small businesses and manufacturers play a vital part in driving this economic growth and job creation, and as your Member of Parliament I continue to champion the small business community to ensure they receive the support they need from the Government.\nInternational Women’s Day is on the 8th March and is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. This year the theme is ‘Let’s build a gender balanced world’, and it is a day that will be marked in Parliament with a debate in the Chamber. Since November 1918 and the passing of the Qualification of Women Act, allowing women to stand for Parliament we have only had 491 women MPs, compared to 4503 men. I am the 431st female MP to have been elected, and today female representation in the House of Commons now stands at 32% (209 out of 650).\nQuite clearly there is still more to do even in Parliament, for us to achieve gender balance through equal representation, hence the cross party campaign 50:50 Parliament which many MPs from across the House support.",

Covid-19 has brought many challenges to us as individuals, as families and as communities and we have endured some of the most draconian measures as a nation in peacetime as we seek to fight the battle against this virus.\nI know that for many people the lockdown brought a degree of hardship and social isolation. Our natural instinct as human beings is to socialise and mix with our friends and family, however a major requirement of our battle to flatten the peak of the pandemic required us all to stay at home so that we could protect our precious NHS as well as the lives of our neighbours and loved ones.\nHowever, if I were to take one thing from the lockdown it is the increased sense of neighbourliness we have seen, whether it was the Thursday night ‘Clap for Carers’ or the extra mile so many have gone to, in supporting others with either a friendly word, a phone call or a helping hand.\nRight across my constituency I have been touched by the generosity of so many people who have helped others, and not least the on-going work of the Neighbourhood Watch in supporting its members and the wider community. Thank you to you all.\nIt was however, regrettable that during lockdown in parts of Brownhills and Shelfield we were subjected to a series of incursions of Unauthorised Traveller Encampments. A number of constituents contacted me and I worked closely with Walsall Council to ensure that the encampments were removed and the sites cleared at the earliest opportunity. As a result of these latest Unauthorised Encampments I wrote to the Home Secretary, The Rt. Honourable Priti Patel MP to request an update on the Government’s consultation to strengthen the law to deal with this issue. I have been assured that the Government remain committed to action on this issue.\nI am very aware that throughout lockdown and the broader Covid-19 response, our local Police have been at the forefront of dealing with the pandemic, and they deserve our sincere thanks. This has further reinforced my belief in the importance of local Neighbourhood policing, and that our local Police force need to retain a local base in our area. I have therefore once again written to the Police and Crime Commissioner about his plans to close Aldridge Police Station.\nI have been assured that no decision to close Aldridge Police Station will be taken before next year’s Police and Crime Commissioner election. I will be continuing to follow this very closely and remain firmly of the belief that no decision should be taken without a full and proper consultation, and furthermore, that there must be a continued base for our local officers.\nLocal police stations are at the very heart of responsive community policing. At a time when we have secured millions of pounds of extra police funding from the Government, it would be wrong that residents in our local communities would be left without any policing base.\nFinally, at the end of July I was delighted to be able to visit The Watch again at Pelsall Hub and meet with Edwin Venables and Bernard Cartwright on their first day of reopening following the lockdown.\nAs we all adapt to a ‘new normal’ and ease our way out the lockdown, I very much hope to be able to see some of you in the coming weeks and, once again, I send a heartfelt thanks to Neighbourhood Watch for all that you do to help keep Rushall, Shelfield, Brownhills and Pelsall safe.",

It also comes too soon after the decision to close the front desk service and use it for training purposes.\nThe decision to close Aldridge Police Station and save £222,000 comes after a decision by the Police and Crime Commissioner to increase back office staff and administration by a staggering £10 million and the final bill for Lloyd House redevelopment hitting a breath-taking £33 million. The current decisions being taken by the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner demonstrate the wrong priorities for our local area.\nThe consultation exercise being trumpeted by Mr Jamieson is a consultation in name only. The Police Station closure programme was sneaked out via a press release at the twelfth hour and even despite the Strategic Policing and Crime Board agreeing to consult nearly a week later there is no plan to engage with local residents across Aldridge-Brownhills.\nAs of today, there is no plan on the Police and Crime Commissioner’s website consultation page and the proposed telephone number (01922 419 589) which we have been advised residents should call about the closure of their Police Station is discontinued. This is not a consultation this is merely a fig leaf ahead of a rubber-stamping exercise on 22nd March by the Police and Crime Commissioner to close the door on our local Police Station in Aldridge.\nI cannot accept the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner’s plan to simply close Aldridge Police Station and especially at a time when that the West Midlands is receiving a record financial settlement from the Government.

It aims to transform the way the nation thinks, talks and acts about the condition. Dementia Friends is about learning more about dementia and the small ways we can help. From telling friends about the Dementia Friends programme to visiting someone you know living with dementia, every action counts.\nHaving already volunteered to be a Dementia Friend myself, I am now organising this Dementia Friends Session to increase awareness locally.\nI signed up to be a Dementia Friend because of the value of understanding more about how dementia is impacting on so many people across our country, and locally, and the practical things I could do to help support people with dementia and their families.

  "http_wendymorton_co_uk_/http_wendymorton_co_uk_view-from-the-house-aldridge-police-station-matters-to-local-residents/content_707.html": "News reached me at the end of last week that the Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands intends to close our Police Station in Aldridge. The decision by West Midlands Police to sell off Aldridge Police Station comes too soon after its decision to close its front desk services and use it for training purposes. It has been undertaken without any consultation and comes on the back of receiving increased funding from the Government in the recent funding settlement. I have therefore written to the Police and Crime Commissioner to demand a meeting at the earliest opportunity as public safety and reassurance are of paramount importance to me and to local residents right across the constituency and that means retaining our Police Station in Aldridge.\nTurning now to Parliament, and earlier this month I joined the Prime Minister and colleagues from across the political spectrum to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918 and some women having the right to vote. Years of groundwork and campaigning had gone into achieving this landmark victory but it did not end there. During World War I women made a significant contribution to the war effort here at home, and continued campaigning finally lead to the Equal Franchise Act in 1928 when all women had the right to vote.\nThere is of course more still to be done, both in terms of equality, and also in terms of encouraging more women into Parliament and into Local Government, something that in my view must always be based on merit. So, in this the centenary year of women’s suffrage it must surely be an opportunity to seek to increase women’s participation in politics at all levels.\nBringing the story of Women’s Suffrage closer to home, there is a display at Aldridge Library celebrating the remarkable life of the ‘Aldridge Suffragette’. I was delighted to have the opportunity to meet up with our magnificent historians Sue Satterthwaite and Len Boulton who continue to uncover and share with us the hidden and rich history of our local area, including the story of Ellen Jones and how she played her part in the campaign for universal suffrage.\nThroughout history colour has been used as a way to provide symbolism and instant visual recognition. The women’s suffragette movement was no different, and the striking colours we are reminded of today represented the many aspects of the cause: Purple, the royal colour and the instinct of freedom and dignity, White for purity, and Green for hope and the emblem of spring.\nDemocracy and active citizenship are to be valued, and I was therefore particularly impressed to be contacted by students at Ormiston Shelfield Academy about the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh, and before half term I joined a Year 7 assembly. We had an excellent discussion and they certainly kept me on my toes with their very well prepared range of questions!\nThis was first published by the Walsall Advertiser and the Sutton Observer on 23 February 2018.",
