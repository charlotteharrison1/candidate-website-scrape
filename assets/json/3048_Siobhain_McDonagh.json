It’s happening again… our local health services have launched a consultation on the future of St Helier Hospital, running until 1st April.\nLike you, I always welcome more money for our treasured NHS – particularly if it is to improve the vital health services across our constituency. That’s why I listened closely when the Government announced an investment of £500m to Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust. But, as ever, the devil is in the detail.\nBehind the posters and press releases, the reality is that these funds will downgrade at least one or both of St Helier or Epsom Hospitals, moving all acute services to a new facility. Local health leaders have stated clearly that their preferred outcome is for St Helier Hospital to lose these vital services and for them to be moved to Belmont in Sutton.\nIf this downgrade of St Helier is approved the hospital would lose:\n- Major A&E\n- Acute Medicine\n- Critical Care\n- Emergency Surgery\n- Maternity Unit\n- In-patient paediatrics and children’s beds\nIn total, St Helier would lose 62% of beds and become nothing more than a glorified walk-in centre. I believe that it is vital that St Helier remains fully operational and retains all of these vital services.\nBecause these proposals would not just impact St Helier. If St Helier loses these services to a new\nfacility in Belmont, countless local residents have told me that they would instead turn to St George’s or Croydon University Hospitals. But these hospitals are already under serious pressure. Imagine the pressure they would then be under! We’ve already lost our Wilson Walk-In Centre – we can’t afford to lose even more.\nIf you have lived in our area for a long time you will share my frustration that this is happening yet again. Similar consultations have happened on multiple occasions (wasting £50 million of taxpayer’s money) but it is the strength of our community and campaign that has kept St Helier fully operational.\nAnd that’s why we need to fight together once again.\nWe should of course welcome any investment in health services in our area, but any available funding must be used where it is needed most: to improve St Helier Hospital on its current site.\nFor decades, the local NHS has tried to downgrade our hospital but it is the strength of our community that\nhas prevailed. I stand ready to campaign for our hospital once again and I hope you will join me.",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_housing-crisis-high-pay_aspx/content_32.html": "Barely a single week goes by without a normal, hardworking family in my constituency being evicted from their privately rented property and sent to temporary accommodation miles away from their family, their schools, their jobs. They join over 83,700 households across our country, including 124,000 children, who are living in temporary accommodation, costing the taxpayer a staggering £1 billion every year. Every single penny badly spent.\nOther families who come to see me are on the ever-expanding housing waiting list, with 1.2 million families across our country now waiting for a place to call home. 1.2 MILLION! What was the Government’s response? Just 6,464 new social homes in 2017-18, the second lowest on record, at a rate that would take 172 years to give everyone on the current waiting list a social rented home.\nOf course, many try to privately rent. But this market simply does not work for those on benefits when the vast majority of privately rented homes are unavailable to them. Some do secure a private tenancy but the reality can often be overcrowded conditions at rents that leave them with little to live on and some without\nenough to eat.\nFinally, there are those fortunate enough to make it on to the housing ladder. When I became an MP in 1997, it took until just the age of 26 for more than half of the population to own their own home. Now even the Bank of Mum and Dad can’t prevent it taking until the age of 34 for the majority of those to make it on to the housing ladder. Why? Because average house prices have skyrocketed by more than 270% in the last two decades, pushing homes completely out of reach for so many. In fact, the average house now costs an extraordinary 7.8 times average annual earnings, compared to 3.6 times earnings in 1997.\nOur country’s housing target is 300,000 new homes per year, a figure that hasn’t been reached since 1969 – back when Councils and Housing Associations were building new homes. That means that England is now on course for its worst decade for housebuilding since the Second World War. We are, quite simply, in the grips of a housing crisis.\nYet, in the last financial year, just 86,685 homes were completed by the ten FTSE 350 housebuilding companies, despite an extraordinary collective pre-tax profit of over £5.37 billion! Meanwhile, these four companies are currently sitting on a land bank of over 300,000 plots between them!\nI have no qualms about those at the top being paid well. I’m not calling for a salary cap or for a widespread cut to Chief Executives pay. If a housebuilding company is doing a good job, using their land and building the homes that we are so desperate for then of course those in charge deserve to be paid well. But the simple statistical proof of their performance is that they are not.\nIn the heart of our country’s housing crisis, the four FTSE 100 housebuilding companies spent an eye watering £53.2 million on their CEO pay. Surely high pay is supposed to be about high productivity, high quality of product. Yet it seems to me that the more substandard the properties that they build and the lower their rate of productivity, the more that they seem to get paid. There seems to be no consequence to poor performance. We are in a housing crisis. Is it really appropriate to provide such preposterous pay packages considering the housebuilding record that I have described today?\nAnd these pay packages are reserved for the few at the top of the tree. The median pay for FTSE 100 housebuilding CEO’s is a staggering 228 times that of a typical UK construction worker. 228 times! At Barratt, the ratio is a disappointing 113:1. At Taylor Wimpey it is an awful 126:1. At Berkeley it is a despicable 333:1. But at Persimmon it is an absolutely deplorable 1561:1!!\nBut this vast scale of inequality looks even worse in light of UK house prices. Assuming the average UK house price is £230,630 and that the average UK construction worker saves 10% of their earnings for buying a house, it would take them 92 years to save up – and 19 years just to save for the deposit alone! But the average FTSE 350 CEO could buy 28 houses outright in 1 year, 532 houses over the 19 years that the construction worker is saving for their deposit and 2,567 houses over the 92 years that they are saving up to afford their home!\nNow I am in no position to prescribe what the highest acceptable pay ratio is. But there can surely be no doubt in anyone’s mind that these ratios are utterly unacceptable, unjust and unfair.\nIn the heart of our housing crisis, it’s clear to me that the British housebuilding industry is not only failing to\nprovide the homes that our country so desperately need, but it has also failed to get its own house in order.\nClick here to\nread more about this issue and my debate on it in the House of Commons.",

So I am relaunching my Work Experience placement scheme. If you are an employer – or if you know anyone who runs a business or voluntary organisation who might like to help a young person get experience in the workplace – I’ve just opened applications for potential job providers. Brochure 2014 I hosted a Business Breakfast on Tuesday 15 October 2013 for potential employers to find out about the scheme. The programme will last 8-12 weeks, beginning on Monday 13 January. More than 80 placements are available, with full details in a brochure. Applications can be made directly by young people between 16 and 24, who are unemployed and live locally. The placements are unpaid (unless employers can afford to pay), and at the end of the 8-12 weeks, the young person should be better equipped for the world of work – we’ve found in the past that many go straight into a new job, and sometimes the placement goes so well that they get a job with the company where they got work experience. I’ll be organising a special thank you Graduation Party at the end of the scheme, to which both employers and young people will be invited. Every young person will receive a ‘work experience certificate’. If you are interested, it’s a really worthwhile scheme – you can obtain details about the scheme by clicking here to read the letter I am sending local residents about the scheme, or opening the brochure here.",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_mitcham-morden_monthly-newsletter_january2013_aspx/content_40.html": "January 2013 Home / Mitcham and Morden / Newsletters / January 2013 Dear Friend, Well, it’s the start of another new year, and I hope you had a chance to recharge your batteries with friends and family. It was good to have a short break, but now that we’re back to reality I thought I’d let you know some of the things going on at the moment. The St Helier saga never seems to get any better, but I also have details about good work being done by other organisations that might be of interest to you. St Helier saga goes from bad to worse You might remember that in my last newsletter about the Save St Helier campaign I mentioned that the threat to shut St Helier’s A&E, maternity, ICU, children’s unit, renal units and 390 in-patient beds had been put on hold because of concerns about Epsom Hospital’s finances. I said I was worried that this might put us in the same position as Lewisham, which is going to lose its A&E because of the financial woes of other hospitals. This whole process began because our local NHS has to save £370m a year, and things are obviously looking even bleaker now that we’re being forced to solve the financial difficulties of the NHS in Surrey too. Well, unfortunately, it looks as though my fears were well founded. Last week, it was reported that instead of closing just one A&E in South West London, we will now lose two. The hospitals under threat are Epsom, Kingston, Croydon and St Helier. As St Helier was singled out for service closures even before this latest development, it is going to be very difficult, and we will all need to rally round if we are to persuade the Government to change tack. The final decision will be taken by the Government Health Minister Jeremy Hunt, and we also have to persuade them to spend money on health services rather than more top-down reorganisations. Even the UK Statistics Authority admit David Cameron’s election pledge to increase health spending has been broken. Now that the threat to St Helier has increased, it’s even more important for all of us to pull together. So please try to come to my next Save St Helier meeting. This time it’s at the House of Commons, at 7.30pm on Monday 11 February. If you want to come, please email siobhain@mmlp.org.uk or call 020 8542 4835 to book your place (I need these details for security). If you need any extra incentive to come along, I’ll also be running tours of the Houses of Parliament after the meeting has finished, so you’ll also have a chance to see behind the scenes at one of London’s most interesting tourist attractions at the same time! Finally, if you are looking for other ways to help the campaign, click here. Learn about things to do in Colliers Wood If you live near Colliers Wood and are looking to take up a new hobby, join a new group, or start a new activity, why not come along to a special \"What's going on in Colliers Wood\" open day on Saturday 26 January. The event is from 11am to 5pm at the Colliers Wood Community Centre and is a chance to meet community groups or just have a chat. I’ll have a stall there, as will the Councillors for Colliers Wood, so why not pop by and say hello. There’ll be groups for young and old, so whether you’re interested in sport or music or just giving something back to your community as a volunteer, I hope you can come along. Among the groups who will be there are The Colliers Wood Chorus, The Colliers Wood Ukulele Orchestra, Ballroom dancing, Dance Express, Alive ‘N’ Kicking, Little League Football, Deen City Farm, Merton Adult Education, Positive Network, Merton Vision, The Donald Hope Library, The Safer Neighbourhood Police Team and Merton Credit Union. Activities for Young People One of the questions I’m most asked is how can we give our young people something to do. Well, actually there are quite a lot of clubs and organisations out there, often run by local volunteers, but one of the big problems is that lots of young people and teenagers don’t even know about them. That’s why I have produced a Directory of Activities for Young People to give you an idea of what’s available. Of course, not everything in the Directory will interest everybody. But there might be something worth trying, like dancing, or scouts, or football. If you’d like a copy, please email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk with your name and address, and I’ll put one in the post. Or if you want to pick one up in person, just pop in to my office at 1 Crown Road, Morden SM4 5DD. One group that just missed my deadline, but that I thought you would want to know about, is a martial TKO arts group run with the help of volunteer police officers from Merton’s police service. It’s a 7 week course in martial arts skills and techniques, and is FREE to young people between 10 and 17. It will all take place at The Hub, at the Tooting and Mitcham FC stadium, Bishopsford Road, Morden, Surrey, SM4 6BF. If you’d like to sign up or find out more, please ring Sgt Steve Murphin on 07771 673 688. Finally, I’d like mention a new activities-based group for 14 to 18 year olds, the Sharks Explorer Unit in Morden. They do all sorts of things, like camping, hiking, rock climbing, abseiling, power boating, sailing and canoeing. They meet on Monday evenings 7.30-9.30pm at Bow Lane Scout Centre off Lower Morden Lane, Surrey, SM4 4AA and are always on the look out for new members. To find out more, please contact David Williams at williamsdavidm@hotmail.com. I should also thank the Holiday Inn in Colliers Wood and its owner Minaz Manji. Using donations from hotel guests and other sources, Mr Manji has set up the Embassy of Man charity, and I asked them to make a donation to buy equipment for the Sharks. I’m delighted to say they said yes! Have your say on cuts to policing As you may know, it looks like there could be some major changes to our local police force. First, Boris Johnson’s office have published proposals to end the 24 hour service at Mitcham police station. There are also proposals to close some local police offices where our Safer Neighbourhood Teams are based. Worst of all, it looks like we will see the end of the teams introduced under David Blunkett and Ken Livingstone, where every ward has a team of 1 Sergeant, 2 PCs and 3 PCSOs. Merton’s police have admitted the 1-2-3 system will be scrapped, and some neighbourhoods could be down to just one or two officers. With the future of our police service up for grabs, you should try your best to come to a meeting taking place next month in Morden. Boris Johnson’s Deputy, Stephen Greenhalgh, will be answering questions from the public about policing numbers across Merton, police stations, and how he is reducing the police budget, so if you have any questions please do get along. The meeting is at the Civic Centre in Morden on 26 February, starting at 6pm. He will be joined by the Met Police’s Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne. Merton's Council Leader, Cllr Stephen Alambritis has said the Council will not support any moves to run down Wimbledon or Mitcham police stations or reduce the number of police officers and PCSOs in the borough. Make sure you have your say too! Make sorting out your finances your new year’s resolution The month after Christmas is often a stressful one, and many people find they are suffering from a financial hangover. So this might be the month to sort out your money troubles. With the economy in such a bad state, I’m seeing people at my Advice Surgery every week complaining about very large debts, and there are things you can do to help. If you feel you are getting into debt problems, the best advice I can give is do not ignore it. The best source of help is the National Debtline (click here or call 0808 808 4000). Every case is different, but be very careful not to borrow even more money, as you could be simply making your debts bigger in the long run, and if you own your home, you could end up losing it. And you should always sort out your priority debts first – these are the debts which could mean losing your home, like mortgage and rent, or that could end up with you having your gas or electricity cut off. Council Tax is important too, because if you fail to pay or to make arrangements with the Council, they will go to court and send in bailiffs, and you will also have to pay court fines, penalty charges and so on. It’s always better to call the Council than to ignore them! As well as the National Debtline, you might also want to have a look at websites run by Citizens Advice and Advice UK. If you need particular help with housing, mortgage debt or problems with welfare benefits you might want to phone the free mortgage helpline run by the housing charity Shelter on 0300 330 0515 or look for advice on their website here. Finally, if you are looking for help with business debts, you should contact Business Debtline here or on 0800 197 6026. Barack Obama Inauguration Party Now, if you’re a regular reader of this newsletter you’ll know I have a liking for American politics. I’ve just finished reading an amazing biography of President Franklin D Roosevelt, and have just picked up a fascinating one about President Lyndon Johnson. I’ve visited the President Clinton memorial. Oh, and for my holiday last year, I took a group of 30 fellow Labour Party members over to Cuyahoga County in Cleveland, Ohio to work on the Obama for America campaign. Well, this week is Barack Obama’s second Inauguration, and on Friday 25 January, I’ll be hosting a party to celebrate. It’s from 7.30pm and will be at Christchurch Church Hall, Christchurch Road, Colliers Wood SW19 2NY. There’ll also be a big screen showing the inauguration ceremony, a great soundtrack of US music, raffle of presidential campaign memorabilia, hot dogs, burgers and a buffet of food from around the world. Our special guest is David Lammy MP, who is Barack Obama’s best British friend, having met him when they were both law students at Harvard Law School. If you fancy coming, space is limited, so you need to book a ticket in advance by emailing me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. In the mean time, have a great 2013! And as always, if you have any ideas for a future newsletter, please do get in touch. My best wishes, Siobhain",

It provides the foundation for so much in our lives and I want all local children to have access to schools that offer them the best chance of a bright, successful future. That’s why I’m delighted to report that a\nnew secondary school is coming to our area.\nBuilt as part of the High Path regeneration scheme, Harris Academy Wimbledon will be a co-educational school, open to both boys and girls. This is fantastic news and will offer local parents real choice when looking for a great school for their children. The new school will be operational on the High Path site (located in an area between the Sainsbury’s and South Wimbledon tube station) from September 2020, providing 180 places for pupils. Before then it will operate from a temporary home at Whatley Avenue near Wimbledon Chase, opening here from September 2018.\nHarris has a superb reputation in Merton and across south London for running great schools. A measure of their success is that 85% of Harris sixth formers gain university offers, with places secured at Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, King’s, Leeds and Bristol. In our borough they’ve turned around two struggling secondary schools and Harris Academy Wimbledon will be led by the same experienced team that has made such a success of Harris Academy Morden. I want local children to get the same chance as others of receiving the great school experience offered by Harris.\nA key issue for the new school is admissions. Harris are putting forward a number of different proposals, each potentially affecting the amount of pupils who can attend from our local area, and are asking for our views. I think it is absolutely vital that local parents are able to have a say in this consultation\nIf you can, please make a submission to the consultation, to help us make Colliers Wood a 'nodal point' for the school. Visit the consultation website here, read my submission below, and download a leaflet on the issue made by Colliers Wood parents below.\nDear Sir / Madam,\nI am writing as part of the consultation on the new Harris Academy Wimbledon, particularly with regard to nodal points. It is my belief that Colliers Wood should be a nodal point for the new school.\nThe demand for secondary school places in Colliers Wood is very great. There are no secondary schools in or around the area, and at the same time Singlegate Primary School’s Year 1 entry has expanded to ninety pupils.\nFurthermore, the new school will be built right at the heart of the Colliers Wood community. In fact, Colliers Wood tube station is just a ten minute walk away from Merton Abbey.\nI hope that you will bear these views in mind, and consider making Colliers Wood station a nodal point to secure access to the new school for local pupils.\nThe Harris Federation has an incredible reputation, and I am delighted that the school is coming to our community, offering parents of primary pupils real choice for a great education.\nYours sincerely,\nSiobhain McDonagh",

It’s been a bumper summer, so there’s plenty to include this month, including news of loads of fun things happening in the area, from football to splashing around in a park. I’ve also got news on beating the litter louts, an update on a favourite old pub, and some information about what I’m doing to get the police to do a better job in Mitcham, among many other things. Fantastic new water play area opened As it’s summer, I really ought to start off with news of an amazing new water play area that’s just opened opposite Figges Marsh, which was opened as part of Love Parks Week. It’s a great place to take the younger ones for a cheap day out or a picnic! With dozens of fountains and interactive features, there’s loads of ways to keep the children occupied – and having fun – throughout the summer holidays. If you’ve not visited yet, you really should pop along! Our local parks are always popular at this time of year, so it’s also good to see that Colliers Wood Rec has again been awarded a ‘Green Flag’, the national award for the best public and community parks and green spaces. The award, which is granted by environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy is given to the best parks and green spaces across the country, and is national recognition for all the staff and volunteers who make our parks a great place for everyone to enjoy. Tackling the scourge of litter louts But of course, if you do have a day out in one of our parks, remember to take everything home with you – and I do mean everything, nothing annoys local residents more than people who litter! Every survey I carry out puts litter near the top of the list of people’s concerns, so I welcome the news that the Council have started to employ a dedicated enforcement team whose job is to deter people from dropping litter on our streets. And not just that, now that an initial grace period has come to an end, they now have the power to give anyone they see littering a £75 on the spot fine. The team has only just started its work, but let’s hope they make a difference. If you see them out and about please let me know what you think of their work. I am also arranging a walkabout next month with the top man in Merton’s environment team, Chris Lee, next month. The idea is to explore hotspots where rubbish, fly-tipping or litter causes particular problems. If you want to nominate a location for him to look at, please email me and we’ll get it looked at. In the mean time, the Council runs an ‘intelligence led’ cleaning service, so if there is a problem area please let them know. You can ring 020 8274 4902 or use their brand new smartphone app, which is called Love Clean Streets. Getting the police to deliver a better service in Mitcham You may remember that last month I was about to hold a public meeting about crime, anti-social behaviour, drinking and even drug taking in Mitcham. Well, thank you to the 250 people who came along to let the local police know what the problems are, and to ask for solutions. The Borough Commander for Merton, Stuart McLeod, very kindly agreed to attend and I can’t fault him for listening. Everyone knows how difficult it is for him at the moment, as the amount he is getting to run our police service is being cut. We have lost more than 40 Police Constables and nearly half our PCSOs since 2010, and Merton’s Safer Neighbourhood Teams of 6 dedicated officers in each of our 20 neighbourhoods have been replaced by teams working in 3 sectors. This has resulted in problems in Mitcham because even though 52% of Merton’s crime takes place in Mitcham, resources are split evenly across the three sectors. However, it’s all very good to listen. What Mitcham needs is more action, and unsurprisingly, Mitcham residents are very frustrated with the police. For over a decade we successfully campaigned for more and more police on to the streets, but it feels like those gains are now being reversed. However, thanks to the public meeting, I’m told that the number of officers in Mitcham town centre has increased. We all now need to stay alert to ensure this isn’t just a temporary reaction. I also wanted to update you on other work I’ve been doing in Mitcham since the meeting. One of the town centre’s biggest problems is the growth in betting shops and the behaviour of some of the people attracted to them. At the meeting, I promised to organise a gathering of all the betting shop companies (Betfred, Paddy Power, Ladbrokes, William Hill) along with the Association of British Bookmakers to discuss the behaviour of their customers in the town centre. Hopefully they will keep to their commitment to take more responsibility for this, and I will keep you informed about progress. Help for your small businesses If you’re interested in setting up a small business, or already run one and want some extra help, I’ve been contacted by Merton Council’s regeneration team and the microfinance charity Fredericks Foundation about an initiative that might help. The London Community Foundation are also involved, with the programme focusing on a combination of finance and mentoring support. Fredericks is holding a ‘readiness for finance’ workshop on Tuesday 9 September at Vestry Hall in Mitcham. The courses start at 9.30 or 2pm, and experts and entrepreneurs will offer a free half-day specialist course that will help with completing a business plan and applying for financial assistance. Places are limited to only 15 people, and you’ll need to be ready to prepare an application for finance and have already made a start on your business plan. For more information on the application process, please visit the Fredericks Foundation website. A “Mitcham Summit” One of the questions I am often asked by Mitcham residents is why the town centre is struggling, and what can be done to get it back on track. Times are tough and people aren’t spending as much in the shops as before. However, although some of our better shops have left, to be replaced by bookmakers and charity shops, we all want Mitcham to be an attractive place that might appeal to shoppers and retailers in the future. That’s why I’ve called a “Mitcham Summit” where all the groups with an interest in making Mitcham better can get together to deliver the kind of town centre we all want. It’s taking place on Thursday 18 September and I have invited all the relevant public bodies, like Merton Council, TfL, the NHS and the police, as well as all the large local businesses with an interest in the town centre like Asda, Morrisons and Lidl. Merton Council has already launched a regeneration programme in Mitcham, installed CCTV and persuaded the police to introduce dispersal zone to tackle anti-social behaviour. Now it’s important that everyone with a stake in the future of Mitcham works together to make the town centre more appealing, so please let me know what you want the summit’s priorities to be. Restoring the Burn Bullock to its former glories One of the most depressing sites in Mitcham and Morden at the moment is the Burn Bullock pub. A listed building, his used to be such a fantastic place to go, overlooking our wonderful historic Cricket Green, the world’s oldest cricket ground. The pub was once a mecca for cricket lovers the world over – apparently, the Australian Test Match squad even used to stay there. Sadly, the building is now in disrepair, and Merton Council has issued several environmental enforcement orders on the owners, so I have arranged a site meeting there at 10am on Friday 12 September. Please join us if you’ve got any comments, or email me any questions. I have also invited the owner of the site, Mr Baig of Phoenix Properties, as well as Chris Lee from Merton Council. Let’s see if a bit of people power can put pressure on the owners to look after this historic site properly. Mitcham Little League openings for managers and players – and a scheme to boost your employability by playing football! At last! Football is back! My team, AFC Wimbledon, has started the season well – and I wanted to let you know about a couple of great football initiatives that might be good for you too. Firstly, Mitcham Little League is starting again soon, and is looking for players, particularly from school years 7 and 8 for boys. They’re also on the look out for managers, so if you are an undiscovered Jose Mourinho and want to give something back to our young football players, why not give them a call. If you’re interested, please email Daryl Ann. His other contact details are here. Meanwhile, if you are a football lover and are looking for work, you might be interested in the Traineeship Academy run by the Street League organisation. This is a 10 week course combining Employability and football. It operates part-time on Mondays to Thursdays, and participants will get 3 employment-related qualifications, and get support finding employment or training, as well as playing football every day! The next South London Academy starts on 22 September in Beckenham. If you are interested in the course, or just fancy playing football, you can also attend free football sessions. Email Daniel Cheshire to find out more. Well, on that positive note, I’ll stop here! Thanks for all you do to make Mitcham and Morden such a strong community – and remember if there’s anything you want included in next month’s email please get in touch – you can email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. My best wishes,",

They will primarily be considering if there is any new information not included in the previous consultations they should be aware of.\nTo support the Dons in their application to the GLA, please write in with the following points: 'I am of the opinion that the previous Mayor's decision to assume control over the Plough Lane planning application from Merton Council was mistaken. I support the proposal to return the application to Merton Council for a final decision.'\nSupporters need to write in by 10th August - so please write in with your support for the Dons to return to Merton using the letter template below and email it to\nplanningadmin@london.gov.uk\nYou can also express your support in the consultation via the 'Bring The Dons Home' website:\nhttp://bringthedonshome.org/extra-time/\n---------------------------------------------------\nEmail to:\nplanningadmin@london.gov.uk\nFAO: Mayor Sadiq Khan, Development & Projects PP18, Greater London Authority, City Hall London, SE1 2AA\nMy details: Your name and full address (including postcode)\n3rd August 2016\nDear Sadiq,\nRe: Planning application no. 14/P4361, Wimbledon Stadium, Plough Lane, SW17 0BL\nI am writing regarding the public inquiry into AFC Wimbledon’s planning application, and in support of your request for additional information about the decision to call it in. I ask that the application be handed back to Merton, as I do not believe that there is any need for a public enquiry.\nBoris Johnson’s decision to call in the application was not justified and contrary to the advice of his officials. As Merton Council’s planning committee granted unanimous approval for the stadium in December 2015, the GLA (whose planning advisors supported and endorsed this decision) advised Boris Johnson that “there were no sound reasons for the Mayor to intervene”, but this advice was ignored. When Wimbledon football club moved to Selhurst Park in 1991 it was a sad loss to the borough and a betrayal of many loyal fans.\nKingsmeadow was a short-term purchase to enable the club to grow from birth, but the club has now outgrown the site. It cannot easily be extended beyond a capacity of approximately 5,000 and many games are already sold out. It does not provide adequate commercial facilities or enable the club to participate more widely with its community. And, of course, crucially, it’s not in the spiritual home of Merton.\nAFC Wimbledon have established themselves as a truly community based club dedicated to developing young people. Their return to the borough would boost the local economy in Merton by revitalising a neglected part of the community. Indeed, research estimates that a new community stadium will provide a total annual financial injection to the area of a staggering £12.7 million. Furthermore, plans include not only a stadium but also 600 residential units, car parking, retail and commercial space, a leisure club and other facilities to transform the presently run down site at Plough Lane.\nIt would also mean that their coaching and education scheme would benefit young people in the borough and enable AFC to extend its award-winning community schemes. At present, 14 dedicated youth coaching personnel currently provide 900 contact hours a season in After School Clubs, Saturday Football Club and Holiday Football Courses. AFC Wimbledon has prioritised community work since it was founded, and was given a Big Society Award by the Prime Minister in 2012 in recognition of this – a new base in the borough will allow the club to expand these schemes still further.\nReturning to a base close to their spiritual home will also secure the future of Wimbledon Football Club. AFC Wimbledon’s success since its (re)founding in 2002 has been phenomenal. The team has risen from the Combined Counties League back to the Football League. As you will no doubt be aware, the club was promoted to League One in May of this year, after a brilliant win against Plymouth Argyle at Wembley Stadium.\nAnd the club’s achievements have proved that a fan-run, community-focused, truly ethical organisation can compete in the professional game. A new ground back in the borough will end more than 20 years in exile and allow the club to set its sights still higher, firmly embedded once more in the heartland of the area it is proud to represent.\nI therefore fully support the proposal to return the application to Merton and look forward to the day when AFC Wimbledon is able to return.\nBest wishes,\nINSERT NAME\nINSERT FULL ADDRESS\nEmail your letter to:\nplanningadmin@london.gov.uk",

  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_keep-mitcham-morden-together_aspx/content_22.html": "In September the Boundary Commission published their initial proposals for new parliamentary boundaries, to be in place by the time of the 2020 election. Sadly, it was not good news for Mitcham and Morden.\nThe Boundary Commission have been required by an act of Parliament to come up with a plan for reducing the number of constituencies from 650 to 600 across the country, and to ensure that all constituencies have between 71,031 and 78,507 registered electors (this does not include citizens of the EU or of other countries who live in the country legally, but are not entitled to vote in general elections).\nThis means that in South London, the number of seats will have to be reduced by two.\nThe Proposals:\nThe initial proposals would see Mitcham and Morden split up into parts of four different constituencies as follows:\n-\nFigges Marsh, Pollards Hill, and Longthornton wards would join with parts of Streatham and Croydon to form a new ‘Streatham and Mitcham’ constituency.\n-\nColliers Wood, Lavender Fields, Cricket Green, and Ravensbury wards would join with most of Wimbledon to form a new ‘Merton and Wimbledon Central’ constituency.\n-\nLower Morden and St. Helier wards would be absorbed into the existing ‘Sutton and Cheam’ constituency.\n-\nGraveney ward would be absorbed into the existing ‘Tooting’ constituency.\nYou can read in more detail about the Boundary Commission proposals on their website by visiting their website - www.bce2018.org.uk.\nDividing our Community:\nAs someone who has watched our community grow and come together over the last 30 years, it breaks my heart to see that the Boundary Commission want to dismantle everything we’ve built up for the sake of meeting a numerical check-list.\nUnder the current plans, the Parish of Mitcham – which can be traced back almost 400 years, and the boundaries of which still form the basis for the current constituency boundaries – would be split into three\nseparate constituencies.\nEvery year I sell poppies outside the ASDA in Mitcham, and then I attend the Remembrance Day service at the Mitcham War Memorial. Under the current plans, the Mitcham War Memorial would be in one constituency, and the Mitcham branch of the Royal British Legion would be in another.\nSimilarly, the Parish of Morden would be divided nonsensically. The Parish Church – St. Lawrence’s – would be pushed in to Sutton, and Morden Town Centre would be merged in to Wimbledon.\nWhen areas and communities with such distinct identities are divided in this kind of indiscriminate way, it dilutes their collective voice. Who will stand up for the interests of Mitcham when it is split three ways?

Please be aware that you do need to book in advance to attend one of the hearings.\nYou can also write to the commission at:\nBoundary Commission for England, 35 Great Smith Street, London, SW1P 3BQ.\nI will be attending the hearing in Westminster on Monday 17th October, between 4.30pm and 6.30pm.

These are largely long serving staff on older contracts who are losing out. They were given an ultimatum to sign the new term and conditions, or lose their jobs.\nSiobhain then asked the Prime Minister directly about this matter, and whether he would guarantee that no worker would be made worse off as a result of the NLW, to which he had\nno response.\nShe made a very\nwell publicised speech on Budget Day, which caught the attention of Business Minister, Anna Soubry, who has promised to meet with Siobhain to discuss the issue.\nWe then helped to launch\na petition on change.org with an anonymous B&Q worker (as B&Q threatened workers with the sack should they go public) which has to date secured 130,000 signatories.\nThe petition has been well covered in the press, especially the fact that some former B&Q bosses have come out to say they are appalled with B&Q's behaviour. You can read the article in the\nMail here, and in the\nMirror here.\nSiobhain has spoken extensively in the national media on the issue, to get this issue the full attention it deserves. In March,\nChannel 4 ran a feature speaking to 'Kevin Jones', the anonymous B&Q employee who launched the change.org petition.\nShe has also\nspoken on Good Morning Britain, to get the campaign more coverage.\nFurthermore, Channel 4 news has also produced a\nshort documentary on the subject, and\ninterviewed Siobhain ahead of Monday's debate.\n**As a result of Siobhain's campaign, B&Q has agreed to extend their period of compensation for affected employees by two years in total. Read about the development\nhere.\n**\nSiobhain secured a backbench debate on Monday 18th April on the implementation of the National Living Wage. You can watch the debate\nhere.\nWe hope that B&Q and the many other companies who have cut staff wages to offset the National Living Wage will change their minds, and give all workers the full wage they truly deserve.\nIf you are affected by this, or would like to find out more, please email Siobhain at mcdonaghs@parliament.uk",

As you will know from last night’s public meeting this view is shared by hundreds of local residents, from 19 to 93 years of age, who turned up in the pouring rain to make their voices heard. I implore you to listen to them.\nThe points you made at the meeting show there is no need to close this centre:\n• Money remains with the patient so there are sufficient funds to keep it open at no extra expense to the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)\n• GPs are difficult to recruit, have low morale and are leaving the profession. This surgery and walk-in practice can provide a full roster of GPs who are enthusiastic about their work and have been judged as one of the best in the country • Alternative surgeries can be two bus journeys away, so are inaccessible and have little parking. This centre is easy to get to for patients and has great parking.\n• Patients using this service would otherwise go to A&Es at St George’s or St Helier Hospitals and would be more expensive to treat.\n• The new surgeries you are suggesting currently recommend The Wilson GP centre and Walk-in Practice to their current patients.\nYou felt there were three barriers that prevented you keeping The Wilson open, all of them can be easily overcome -\nPlanning Permission\nThis morning I again checked with Merton Council Leader Stephen Alambritis and he tells me that Merton has not received any planning application from you to extend the use of the site for a health centre. This contradicts the information I was given by one of your CCG officers who said a planning application was submitted by you two months ago. I find this difficult to understand, so please can you send me a copy of this application today. If you find the application was not submitted please explain how this misinformation came about and I will forward your letter to all who attended. I am sure you wish to clarify this matter.\nCouncillor Alambritis tells me if an application is received he will treat it as a matter of urgency. He asks that you call him immediately today on his mobile. If, for any reason, you can’t get through call me and I will help you.\nProcurement\nYou explained to local residents that you could not extend the life of the centre without procuring a new contract. There is only one answer to this - please start the procurement process immediately! If you cannot currently do so in the timeframe I am happy to use my office as the Member of Parliament for Mitcham and Morden to get a meeting for you with the responsible Government Minister or the Chief Executive of NHS England.\nI also heard the interchange between yourself and Mr Roger Norman who was until recently Clinical Theatre Manager at St George’s. I agree with him that there is no problem with you finding appropriate mobile equipment for blood tests and X-rays and, as you explained, this is treated as capital expenditure and does not come from your revenue budget. However, if this does not prove possible than it’s better to have a great centre without these facilities than no services at all.\nDevelopment of site\nI have spoken to two local developers who both know The Wilson site well and have worked on sites with far great constraints. Contradicting your information, both tell me that it is perfectly possible to keep the centre open at the same time as developing the wider site. I am not suggesting for a minute that these developers should undertake the work but surely it would be sensible for you to meet them and hear an alternative opinion.\nDrop these ill-considered plans\nYou have stated your ambition of creating a new centre on the main Wilson Hospital site, encompassing such diverse elements as a Citizens Advice Bureau, Job Centre, meeting rooms and art classes. I have to say that on the evidence from our ongoing dialogue and last night’s public meeting, I believe there is no coherent or workable programme for delivering this or the healthcare local people so need and deserve.\nJust as I do not believe you will deliver this new centre of your dreams I also do not believe you will or can relocate the 5,900 patients from this GP practice nor the thousands each year who use the walk-in centre. I know this from three sources; the number of complaints I receive across Mitcham and Morden about access to current GP services, the evidence from residents at the meeting and because you have only been able to re-locate 300 out of 5,900 patients thus far. For information, many patients who have moved to new GP practices, as advised in your letter, are now getting in touch with me to complain. In one case an elderly lady saw her GP application ripped up in front of her face by a new receptionist who told her she was out of their catchment area!\nI was born and raised in this community and have lived here all my life. I listen to local residents and have been campaigning on this very issue since the 1980s. I stood on picket lines against the closure of The Wilson Hospital and afterwards for this GP practice and walk-in centre to be opened. It is a matter of record and shame that your organisation chose to invest the millions of public money it had at its disposal in the most affluent area of Merton with the least health need and not at The Wilson or St Helier Hospital. You are now proposing to take away the little my community has, which is a fully functioning and brilliant GP and walk-in health centre.\nI say to you again I am willing to do everything I can in my power to overcome all barriers you face in keeping The Wilson GP Practice and Walk-in Centre open. Please call an urgent meeting of your committee to overturn this decision, something you can do right now as Chair of the CCG. Please also call me and I am ready to help.\nThere is no shame is admitting you made the wrong decision but there is great shame in pursuing a reckless course of action to the detriment of the health of local residents who work hard and pay their tax and national insurance.\nOn behalf of the residents of Mitcham and Morden I urge you in the strongest possible terms to drop these ill-considered and damaging plans, and work with me to find a better way forward.\nIn all good faith,\nSiobhain McDonagh MP",

When this happened, they were often replaced with fee-charging cash machines, Which left vulnerable people without access to cash.\nTake Pollards Hill as an example. The neighbourhood is cut off from the London transport network, with residents relying on the small shopping parade for everyday spends. There are two cash machines on the parade, but both charge a fee and are very profitable. That means that residents who are carefully managing a budget and taking out £10 at a time face a 20% premium just to access their own cash. How can that possibly be right or fair?\nThat’s why I campaigned for an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill that would guarantee a minimum level of cash access, but importantly; ensure that this access is free, and what a fantastic result we achieved! The Bill will proceed through the House of Lords and eventually become law, making a real difference to the lives of residents in the Mitcham and Morden area. Our team work on behalf of the more vulnerable members of our community means that nobody in our constituency will have to pay any rate to withdraw their own money again.\nOver the course of the campaign, we have managed to win the support of six Select Committee Chairs, seven members of the Treasury Committee and dozens of Opposition MPs, from all parties, who had put their names to our amendment. Over one hundred people came together to sign the amendment, I posed questions on the topic to the Prime Minister at Prime Minister’s Questions and even garnered the support of consumer rights group “Which?” All serving as a great example of what we can achieve when we work together!\nYou can read my speech, speaking in favour of my amendment\nhere:\nAnd you can watch a clip from my speech\nhere:",

It’s based on the 1984 charity single and Christmas number one ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas?’ with new lyrics to publicise the plight of shopworkers. It was recorded in Alaska Street studios, with the help of volunteers and MPs, including the Kevin Brennan MP, Julie Cooper MP, Mary Creagh MP, Julie Elliot MP, Helen Goodman MP, Carolyn Harris MP, Dan Jarvis MP, Mike Kane MP, Fiona MacTaggart MP, Melanie Onn MP and Angela Rayner MP.\nYou can watch the video below, and scroll down for more information.\nPRESS RELEASE (click here to read in full)\nSince the introduction of the ‘National Living Wage’ this year, some of the UK’s most famous companies have been cutting the total pay of their long-serving staff, while increasing per hour wages.\nThere are dozens of companies across the country that are making these pay cuts, mainly in the retail, hospitality and food production sectors. Many are multinational companies. Some of them have historically great reputations but have made terrible mistakes, while others are notorious for treating staff poorly.\nWith in-work poverty creeping up, the scandal of low-paid Britain is more worrying than ever – and our biggest and best companies have a responsibility to treat their loyal staff with respect.\nWe know that the public are getting angrier, with a quarter of a million people signing national petitions against these pay cuts, but despite this, we are discovering more and more companies issuing new contracts with reduced pay. If companies do not stop the practice of tearing up old contracts and reducing total pay, then the government must intervene.\nWe are calling on company Boards to reverse their decisions at their Board meetings in January.\nTop lines:\nLabour MPs launched the ‘National Living Rage’ single this week, to publicise the fact that thousands of low paid workers are receiving pay cuts this Christmas.\nThese pay cuts have been made by many British companies around the country, through ending old contracts, with short ‘show’ consultations, and issuing new contracts, with reduced pay packages. The contract changes include: termination of double time on Sundays, Bank Holidays; elimination of ‘unsocial’ hours payments; ending the inclusion of 30m lunches in staff contracts; termination of free lunches; pension cuts; abolition of seasonal bonuses; termination of location premiums; abolition of a range of additional allowances; among many other contract changes. All of these changes have been made around the introduction of the new higher basic rate of pay, as an opportunity to cut costs.\nThis campaign is driven by the desire to raise awareness of the fact that thousands of people in this country, who are already on low pay, are receiving a pay cut.\nWho is affected and who is cutting pay:\nAt the high street retailer M&S, it was estimated that about 11,000 of their total workforce of 83,000 would be negatively impacted in some way by pay cuts – that’s 13% of the workforce affected adversely (almost all on pre-2002 contracts). We also know, directly from conversations with M&S executives, that 3,100 people will be affected by at least £1000 or more as a result of these pay cuts – comprising 4% of the total number of employees.\nWe estimate that over half a million people in the retail, restaurant and food manufacturing industry may be receiving a pay cut. That’s 624,000 people to be precise, representing 13% of the total number of workers in these industries.\nAnd around 4% of the total number of staff in these industries may be seeing a very significant cut in their pay packets – that’s around 192,000 employees around the country, taking home LESS as a result of unscrupulous employment practices.",

We are now getting to the stage where options are emerging and before we put them in the public domain I would value the opportunity to talk to you about them and get your steer on how to best engage our local communities.\nJust to remind you of the context, as you know we are developing our estates strategy for 2020 - 2030 as it is clear our buildings will not be fit for the purpose of delivering safe healthcare beyond 2020. We expect that the CQC report on their inspection of our hospitals, when it is published at the end of May, will make explicit reference to the poor state of our estate.\nWe engaged extensively with our communities and key stakeholders in 2015 and A summary of feedback was presented to our board at its public meeting on 9 October 2015: https://www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk/download.cfm?doc=docm93jijm4n4246.pdf&ver=8691 With a further Estates Engagement Update Report presented to our board on 12 February 2016: https://www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk/download.cfm?doc=docm93jijm4n4836.pdf&ver=10449\nThis work helped us to make the case for new facilities, and in February our commissioners and regulators gave us the go-ahead to develop a Strategic Outline Case to help us understand our options and evaluate them. We held further engagement events with staff and with our communities in March, identifying the key criteria against which options should be evaluated, which have fed into the development of the Strategic Outline Case. Over 200 people took part in this and gave us over 600 different ideas to consider.\nIt is clear from this feedback that a one-site, so called “super hospital” will not be a viable option for us as local access to a great many of our services is a key criteria for our communities. Therefore, we are currently working up options which ALL involve retaining a considerable volume of activity at both the St Helier and Epsom sites. I can share with you the emergent list but it includes urgent care, elderly care, planned care surgery, outpatients and diagnostics. These are all the services that best enable us to work with our local communities to deliver preventative and proactive care for our patients that is focussed on keeping them well.\nHowever, there is a clear quality argument that centralising our acute services for the sickest patients on one of our sites will enable us to provide a higher standard of care in a purpose built facility. We believe that there are four potential options, where we locate acute services on one site, whilst retaining most of our services on the Epsom and St Helier campuses. The options that we believe may be viable are:\na. A new build around the St Helier site for acute services with services remaining at Epsom\nb. A rebuild of the Epsom site for the acute services with services remaining at St Helier\nc. A new build on our estate at Sutton Hospital with services remaining at both Epsom and St Helier\nd. A new build in partnership with the Royal Marsden on their site in Sutton for the acute services with services remaining at both Epsom and St Helier\nWe are planning to engage with both our staff and our communities in May during the period between the Mayoral election and the beginning of purdah for the EU Referendum, and we hope to give as many people as possible the opportunity to assess these options against the criteria which were identified at our events in March. Prior to our public engagement, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss these options with you in more detail, and take your steer as to how best to engage with your communities.\nYours sincerely\nDaniel\nFrom: Daniel Elkeles [mailto:Daniel.Elkeles@esth.nhs.uk] Sent: 28 April 2016 13:44 To: MCDONAGH, Siobhain <siobhain.mcdonagh.mp@parliament.uk> Subject: Further update on Epsom and St Helier Estates Review\nDear Siobhain,\nYesterday I wrote to you to outline our proposed next steps in engaging our communities about the potential options for securing modern hospital facilities for our patients.\nFollowing this letter, it has become clear that the engagement work should wait until the current national planning process to implement the NHS Five Year Forward View has reached its conclusion. Both South West London and Surrey Heartlands areas are producing Sustainability and Transformation Plans and our estates strategy must align with that important work and cannot pre-empt it.\nWe will, however, be aiming to complete the actual analysis that we have commissioned for our estate as it will provide a useful input into the Sustainability and Transformation Plans. I would like to apologise for any anxiety my email yesterday may have caused you. I am, as always, available to discuss this further if you would find that helpful.\nYours sincerely Daniel\nText received from Daniel Elkeles to Siobhain McDonagh, May 3rd\nJust to follow up the phone call. Your initial reaction that there isn’t time to do proper engagement between the purdahs was felt to be correct.\nAnd up the line want to land clearly the message that we want four acute sites in SWL before starting the engagement which is what the planning submission for the end of June will say.\nSo nothing will happen initiated by the hospital until July other than my continued lobbying for £hundreds of millions so we can get the hospital estate that we can all be proud of. Hope that clarifies. If not, please do phone back. Daniel\nFrom: Daniel Elkeles [mailto:Daniel.Elkeles@esth.nhs.uk] Sent: 10 May 2016 12:35 To: COLGAN, Dee <dee.colgan@parliament.uk> Subject: Letter for Siobhain\n10 May 2016\nDear Siobhain,\nIt is disappointing to see that Jerome Neil is quoting you as saying that I notified you that we were launching a consultation into closing the St Helier Hospital. I want to make it crystal clear that we are not.\nAs you know we are working on our estates strategy to identify options to replace our decaying estate. Our buildings are now in the 10 worst for critical infrastructure backlog maintenance in England, 43% of our clinical space is deemed not suitable to provide patient care and we have half the number of single rooms we should have to provide an infection free environment. This means we are spending more than £5m a year more than we should do on keeping our buildings safe. This is money we should be spending on patient care.\nTo make the initial case for the hundreds of millions pounds we need to secure to replace our buildings we have to engage people in the development of potential scenarios. In the letter I sent you last week I made it clear that in all the scenarios the Trust has looked at to date, we were looking to maintain hospital services at both St Helier and Epsom hospitals.\nI also explained to you in my follow up email of 28 April that I have been advised that the engagement of our communities on potential future scenarios should wait until the current national planning process to implement the NHS Five Year Forward View has reached its conclusion. As explained in our letter last week, the NHS in both South West London and Surrey Heartlands is working with its local authorities on a long term plan for local services. All NHS regions across the country are required to do this. The five-year plan is called the ‘sustainability and transformation plan’ (STP). This work is being jointly carried out by local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), hospitals, community health services and mental health trusts, with the support of local councils and members of the public. We will build on work already taking place in south west London and Surrey Downs and we will be looking at all aspects of local health services – hospitals, primary care, mental health and community services.\nBoth South West London and Surrey Heartlands areas are producing Sustainability and Transformation Plans and our estates strategy must align with that important work. It cannot pre-empt it.\nWe have spent the last year providing certainty to our staff on the future. As a result we have increased the number of clinical staff by almost 350. This has meant our vacancy rate has halved and our agency nurse spend had reduced by 70%. I and our whole Trust Board are committed to now securing the money to invest in appropriate buildings to enable us to treat your constituents and all the other communities we serve in a fit for purpose environment. I hope that you can join us in our work to secure the investment that our local NHS so badly needs.\nI hope it will be possible for me to attend the meeting on Monday 16 May referred to in the attached letter, to answer any questions that are raised. I wonder if it would also be helpful for us to meet on the St Helier site, along with local commissioners, to discuss these issues in more detail?\nBest wishes\nYours sincerely\nDaniel Elkeles Chief Executive\nFrom: MCDONAGH, Siobhain Sent: 12 May 2016 17:50 To: 'Daniel.Elkeles@esth.nhs.uk' <Daniel.Elkeles@esth.nhs.uk> Subject: RE: Further update on Epsom and St Helier Estates Review\nDear Mr Elkeles,\nI am disappointed by your letter which I regard as both disingenuous and dishonest.\nYour most recent letter regarding the current proposals for the St Helier site makes no mention of your email to me of April 27th in which you proposed to consult on developing a new acute hospital on one of four sites, with only one of those sites being St Helier.\nTo quote your email:\n‘…\nthere is a clear quality argument that centralising our acute services for the sickest patients on one of our sites will enable us to provide a higher standard of care in a purpose built facility.\nWe believe that there are four potential options, where we locate acute services on one site, whilst retaining most of our services on the Epsom and St Helier campuses.

A new build in partnership with the Royal Marsden on their site in Sutton for the acute services with services remaining at both Epsom and St Helier…’\nYour email suggested that these options would be under consultation between May 6th and the beginning of the purdah period of the EU referendum, a period of less than four weeks, culminating in a public meeting on May 21st.\nAnd not only did you send me this in an email, you may recall that we also discussed this all over the phone.\nClearly other people within the NHS share my view that this is an unrealistic and reckless timetable - hence your withdrawing the proposals the following day, and then suggesting that the consultation would instead begin in July.\nThese proposals are almost identical to those presented during the ‘Better Healthcare Closer To Home’ consultation which took place in 2005. The current proposed consultation is the third that we have had since I became an MP in 1997. I estimate that the current cost of consultations alone has been in excess of £30m. Continuing the same consultation is a waste of public money and it cannot be right to keep doing the same thing until you wear the public down. I am therefore asking the Public Accounts Committee to investigate appropriate use of public money in repeated consultations.\nSince taking up your post as Chief Executive of Epsom and St Helier Trust it has been increasingly clear to me that your main purpose is to close St Helier as a fully functioning general hospital, leaving minimal services, such as outpatient appointments and an urgent care center, but removing the A&E, maternity units, renal unit, major surgery, and over 230 beds. I have no doubt that you wish to keep minimal services on the St Helier site to pacify those who oppose the closure of St Helier as a fully-functioning general hospital.\nIndeed as you will recall during the General Election, you secretly employed consultants to undertake these plans – this only came to light as a result of a BBC journalist overhearing a telephone conversation from the consultants.\nI understand that you believe that you can secure the half-a-billion-pound capital funding for a new hospital as a result of the reduction in running costs that a new site would provide. Should this fund be available, I do not understand why this could not be used to build a new hospital on or opposite the current St Helier site. I would also kindly like to see the back paper work to show that half-a-billion pounds is indeed available, such as a letter from Government confirming this is the case.\nYou are most welcome to attend the meeting on Monday, and to make your case. But please be aware that I remain absolutely determined to ensure a hospital including A&E and Maternity Unit is maintained at St Helier, and I will not be browbeaten by yourself, or intimidated by the unequal access we have to sufficient funds to argue our respective cases.\nAs the elected representative of the constituents of Mitcham & Morden, who rely on St Helier and who are in the most need of healthcare of any community within the Epsom & St Helier Trust catchment area, I reserve the right to keep my constituents fully aware of your proposals.\nYours sincerely,\nSiobhain McDonagh MP\nFrom: MCDONAGH, Siobhain Sent: 13 May 2016 16:31 To: daniel.elkeles@esth.nhs.uk Subject: FW: Further update on Epsom and St Helier Estates Review\nDear Daniel\nJust to confirm that we would very much welcome your attendance at Monday’s meeting.\nThanks,\nSiobhain\nOn 13 May 2016, at 17:40, Daniel Elkeles <Daniel.Elkeles@esth.nhs.uk> wrote:\nDear Siobhain,\nThank you for your letter of 13 May 2016.\nI think it is a great shame that we find ourselves at loggerheads. I think we are both trying to do the best that we can for the people that we serve. You for the residents of Mitcham and Morden and I for the 500,000 people who use our hospitals and for our 5000 staff. Just like you my family and I are residents of the area as well and I have a great desire to ensure that Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust thrive as they are my families local hospitals too. As I have explained to you on many occasions, the poor state of our buildings is a major barrier to doing that. As an organisation we are determined to improve the facilities - and therefore the standard of care that we offer.\nAs you refer to in your letter, it will be necessary for us to raise a substantial amount of capital to achieve the necessary improvements to our buildings and facilities. It would be helpful to have your support in doing that, for the good of all the communities that we serve. In order that we can ascertain whether or not that funding will be forthcoming it is vital that we complete our Strategic Outline Case. As part of that work it is only appropriate as you suggest that we consider the viability of building a new hospital at the St Helier site.\nI\nbelieve I have been open and transparent with you and have been very clear that we are a long way off any consultation on the provision of our services. We do, however, believe it is vital to keep our communities informed and have ongoing discussions about our services and what they might look like in the future and we intend to do that whenever possible. There is a vast difference between “consulting” on options (which infers that we have reached the advanced stage of developing proposals that require formal consultation) and discussing potential scenarios with the communities that we serve.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, we do not envisage a consultation taking place during 2016, though we will continue to talk to people and gather their views.\nFurthermore, all of this work will need to complement the national planning process to implement the NHS Five Year Forward View. The NHS in both South West London and Surrey Heartlands are working with their local authorities on a long term plan for local services - all NHS regions across the country are required to do this, and each region is producing a five-year plan called the Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP). In order to ensure that our estates review complements the STP vision, any further engagement on our estate will wait until this process has been completed.\nMy view is that you should proceed with your meeting on Monday, but in order that we can discuss all of the issues in a constructive way, and that I can show you the scale of the facility challenges that we face, I think\nit would be useful to meet at St Helier Hospital after the St Helier by-election. I’d be grateful if you could let me know when this is convenient for you.\nI hope that you have a good weekend.\nDaniel\nFrom: MCDONAGH, Siobhain Sent: 16 May 2016 10:54 To: Daniel Elkeles <Daniel.Elkeles@esth.nhs.uk> Subject: Re: Further update on Epsom and St Helier Estates Review\nThank you for your email. I would be very grateful if you could clarify whether you will be attending tonight's meeting?\nFor the record you emailed me on April 27th informing that you intended to \"engage\" on site preferences on a new acute hospital on St Helier, Epsom or Sutton sites between the end of the Mayoral elections and the start of purdah on the EU Referendum with a major consultation event on May 21st. This was followed by your calling me and explaining the same.\nOn April 28th you emailed and texted me to say that you had reconsidered and agreed the timescale was too tight. A consultation/engagement would begin in July after South West London and Surrey Heartlands had submitted its Sustainability and Transformation Plan. Now, who knows? Your plans rarely appear to last more than 24 hours.\nI remain convinced that your ambition is to strip St Helier of its A&E and maternity unit. Building a general hospital on the Sutton site and leaving St Helier a site for out patients and an urgent care centre thereby closing St Helier as a functioning General hospital. Please be assured that I will do all I can to work with local residents to prevent St Helier closing. Siobhain\nPs please could you confirm whether you will be attending tonight's meeting. As I am sure you will recall it was you who wrote to me asking if you could attend.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nFrom: Daniel Elkeles [mailto:Daniel.Elkeles@esth.nhs.uk] Sent: 16 May 2016 14:02 To: MCDONAGH, Siobhain <siobhain.mcdonagh.mp@parliament.uk> Subject: RE: Further update on Epsom and St Helier Estates Review\nDear Siobhain\nThank you for your response. When I wrote to you last week saying that I hoped to be able to attend the meeting tonight, I had not anticipated the extent that the hospital would become the centre piece of\nthe by-election campaign. As a public body we should not participate in active engagement during election campaigns and so I believe that we should wait until after the by-election in order that you and I can have a constructive discussion and I can show you the scale of the buildings challenges that we face.\nI, and our whole Trust Board are committed to ensuring that we work with our communities to deliver the best possible care from the best possible facilities, and intend to continue those discussions after the\nSustainability and Transformation plans are submitted at the end of June. As I have made clear, we are a long way off any formal ‘consultation’ process which we will only get to when the NHS has accepted the case for investment in our buildings. As I have also said, your help in making that case would be greatly appreciated.\nDaniel",

Welcome back to more on the latest news and events here in\nMitcham and Morden as 2015 gets under way.\nThis will be\nan exciting year with less than 4 months to go until the General Election. As expected there will be loads happening and\nthis is the first of a series of newsletters that will keep you up to date and\nlet you know what’s going on in the constituency.\nChristmas Tree\nCollection\nMerton Council\nis once again collecting Christmas trees for composting. This popular local service was started many\nyears ago by Labour. They will collect real\ntrees for free up until 25th January 2015. In order to have your tree collected just remove\nthe decorations and place it at the front of your property where it can be\nclearly seen from the road, but not on the pavement. If your tree has not been\ncollected by the 26th January then you can let Merton know by\ncompleting the missed collection form or calling the refuse team on 020\n8274 4902.\nIf you have\ntransport and prefer to do so you can take your Christmas tree to the Garth Road Refuse and Recycling\nCentre, and place\nit in the green waste for composting.\nYou can also\nuse the missed collection form throughout the year if your household\nrubbish or recycling is not collected on the day it should be.\nProblems with street cleaning and\nfly-tipping\nOver recent\nweeks there have been problems with the street sweeping in parts of Mitcham and\nMorden. If your street has not been\nswept or you are concerned about the amount of litter or fly-tipping in your\nroad you can call the street sweeping team on 020 8274 4902 to report the\nproblem. There is also an ‘app’ you can\ndownload if you have a ‘smart’ phone.\nIt’s called Love Clean Streets and\nis free to download onto your phone. If\nwe keep up the pressure we will see cleaner streets for our community.\nTime for Wheelie Bins in Merton?\nAre you as\nfed-up as I am with seeing burst black bags on our streets, and rubbish strewn\nacross the pavements? I speak to residents on a daily basis who tell me that\nthey are sick of seeing some of our streets in such a dirty state, and I agree\nwith them.\nThat is why\nI am going to work with Merton’s Labour Council to try and introduce Wheelie\nBins across the borough. This will not be easy since the government have already\nforced the Council to make over £70 million worth of savings since 2010, with a\nfurther £32 million of cuts on the way. But working with other local councils\nacross South London I think we can make this work.\nI am going\nto be hosting a coffee morning with Leader of the Council Stephen Alambritis on\nSaturday 31st January at\n10.30am-11.30am. Please come along\nto the Lavender Steers Mead Children’s Centre, Lavender Avenue, Mitcham, CR4\n3HL (see map here). Many people have strong and differing opinions\nand I know Stephen Alambritis wants to hear them all so please come along and\nlet us know what you think.\nEmployment and Training\nOpportunities\nCircle\nHousing Merton Priory is offering a range of free courses and training to all\nMerton residents through their Routes2Work\nProgramme.\nSince 2012 Routes2Work has supported over 250\npeople into employment and apprenticeships, 840 into further education, and the\nstart-up of 70 small businesses\nThe courses\non offer include Construction, Customer Service, Health and Social Care,\nSecurity and Starting Your Own Business.\nThey also run a Job Club. Take a\nlook at their website – there are plenty of exciting free opportunities. On their website it’s easy to register your\ninterest for the courses on offer.\nJohn Edmonds, co-author of Man-Made, to give an exclusive preview\ntalk!\nOn Thursday\n22nd January John Edmonds, former General Secretary of the GMB Union\nfor 13 years, will be giving a free\ntalk on the topic of his forthcoming book Man-Made,\nco-authored with Eva Tutchell.\nThe book, to be published in\nMarch 2015, looks to explain why so few women hold\npositions of power in Britain. It is based on interviews with over one-hundred\nsuccessful women.\nIn John’s own words, “the book is\ncalled Man-Made because men have made the rules in our country and women\nmust do their best to fit in”.\nThe talk will take place on Thursday 22nd January at 8pm at Merton Vision, 67 Clarendon Road, Colliers Wood, London, SW19 2DX\n(see map here). Please do come along and join\nwhat promises to be a fascinating evening of discussion on a very important and\nemotive issue.\nAre you paying too much for your\ncable TV and internet?\nI have been contacted\nby a local resident who for many years has had her TV and internet service\nprovided by Virgin Media. Her contract\nwas originally taken out with ‘Telewest’ so the TV decoder box and modem were\nold so she called Virgin to see if she could have new equipment only to\ndiscover that she has been overpaying by £15 per month for years. Apparently Virgin Media don’t seem to tell\nyou if you could be on a better deal! If\nyou are a long standing customer it may be worth contacting Virgin Media on 0800\n953 9500 to see if they can offer you a cheaper deal.\nAFC Wimbledon\nAFC\nWimbledon have submitted their planning application to Merton for a new stadium\nclose to their roots on Plough Lane. You\ncan see more about their plans on their website - www.afcwimbledon.co.uk. Take a look.\nI have written to the Council supporting the application because I\nbelieve their return to the borough will benefit the wider community in Merton.\n2015 Community Calendars\nYou may well\nhave received my 2015 Community Calendar in the last couple of months. I hope\nyou will find it helpful and will enjoy seeing some of the great community\norganisations and volunteers that make Mitcham and Morden such a wonderful\nplace to live.\nIf you\ndidn’t get one and you would like one, or even if you did get one and would\nlike another – I have plenty of spares in my Morden office (1 Crown Road,\nMorden, SM4 5DD map). Please pop in one day and pick one up for you\nor your family if you would like one. The\noffice is open every day from 10am-6pm so there will always be a friendly face\nwhether you are coming in for a calendar or for any other reason.\nThanks for\nall you do to make Mitcham and Morden such a strong community – and remember if\nthere’s anything you want included in next month’s email please get in touch – you\ncan email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk.\nMy very best\nwishes,",

  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_londons-green-belt_aspx/content_34.html": "There’s a garage site a stone’s throw\naway from Tottenham Hale Station that is designated as Green Belt, but there is\nnot a blade of grass to be seen. In fact, apart from a green car parked in the\ngarage, there is no green to be seen anywhere.\nWhy does this matter? Because this Green Belt designation has prevented\na Housing Association from building affordable homes on the site.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government's consultation\nregarding the National Planning Policy Framework provided the perfect\nopportunity to make this case. Along with Politicians, academics, economists,\ncharities and Housing Associations, Siobhain submitted the below proposal.\nYou can read more about the campaign here: City\nAM, Telegraph,\nEvening\nStandard, The\nTimes, City\nMetric.\nGroup Submission\nBackground: A Crisis of Housing Supply\nThere is a broad consensus that\nBritain, in general, England in particular, and London most of all, is\nsuffering from a near housing crisis: of affordability and supply. The\nepicentre of this crisis is London and its wider region although there are\ngrave problems of access and affordability elsewhere. The Government has\nadopted an ambitious target of generating an additional 300,000 homes a year\nfor England. The 2018 GLA draft plan has an annual target of 65,000 ‘net additions’\na year. This would be well over double the average achieved in the past 10\nyears.\nThese ambitious targets need to be set\nin the context of history. Historically housing targets were set in terms of\nbuilding. There was recognition as long as 20 years ago that there was an\nimpending problem of housing supply and affordability. The Barker Review was\nset up in 2002 to address these problems. Out of that a target for annual house\nbuilding of 240,000 emerged in 2007 with 2m of the target to be built by 2016.\nIn the outturn only 1.3m houses were built in that 10 years and in 2016 annual\nbuilding, far from being 240,000 a year, was 140,000. In 2007 the GLA\nestablished an annual target of 31,505 houses (raised to 33,400 in 2009). The\nactual number of houses built in the GLA from 2007 to 2016 averaged 20,709 –\nonly about one third of the current target.\nThe point of this is to emphasise the\nlong term nature of our housing supply problem and the difficulty of tackling\nit without radical changes. The revision of the National Planning Policy\nFramework provides an opportunity make a constructive start to improving our\nability to build more houses.\nThe Green Belt\nA critical factor contributing to the\ndifficulty in building houses accessible to jobs is the supply of land. One\npolicy, the Metropolitan Green Belt, prevents building over an area more than\nthree times that of the GLA: the Metropolitan Green Belt accounts for nearly\none third of all Green Belt land in England despite the pressure of demand for\nhousing being highest in this region. In all, Green Belt designation prevents\nany building over an area nearly half as big again as all urbanised land in\nEngland. Green Belts were established not to preserve open countryside for\nenvironmental or recreational use but to stop settlements merging and safeguard\nhistoric towns. We strongly support the NPPF’s overriding goals of\nprotecting the environment and our beautiful country side and promoting\nsustainable transport and development which complements that. But the NPPF\nalso, rightly, supports a presumption in favour of sustainable development.\nProposal\nWith these considerations in mind we\nwould suggest that there should be a presumption in favour of permitting\ndevelopment of any land within one kilometre of a train station (TfL or\nNational Rail) which provides access to London Zone 1 within a 45 minute travel\ntime unless that land fell into one or more of these categories:\nProtected under the Birds and Habitats Directives and/or designated as\nSites of Special Scientific Interest; land designated as Local Green Space, an\nArea of Outstanding Natural Beauty; land within a National Park (or the Broads\nAuthority) or defined as Heritage Coast; irreplaceable habitats including\nancient woodland; aged or veteran trees; designated heritage assets (and other\nheritage assets of archaeological interest referred to in footnote 55 of the\ndraft NPPF); and areas at risk of flooding or coastal change.\nIt is judged that this proposal would\nreflect the overarching goal of promoting sustainable development and greatly\nimprove the supply of housing since land capable of providing more than 1\nmillion homes could be released. It would give reality to the aim of promoting\nsustainable transport. The purposes of Green Belt designation set out in the\nNPPF para 133 do not include any environmental or recreational benefits; the\nexemptions set out above would ensure that no land of significant environmental\nor amenity value could be developed and, in reality, much of the land which\nwould be made available for development is not green at all. There\nshould, therefore, be no concern that the aim of sustainable development would\nbe impaired, especially since there would be significant benefits in terms of\nimproving sustainable transport.\nThis proposal, if implemented, would\nnot lessen the protection of any Green Belt land further than one kilometre\nfrom a station giving access to London Zone 1 within 45 minutes. But it would\nyield a presumption of residential-led development for land close to such stations.\nIn the first instance local communities would be encouraged to develop plans\ndetailing the form of development acceptable on the released land and setting\nout other guidelines for its development. However, the housing crisis is urgent\nand to avoid protracted delay this process should be confined to a reasonable\ntime limit. How long it would be reasonable to allow for the formulation of\nlocal plans for the use of the released land should be agreed after the\nadoption of this revised NPPF provision.\nConclusion\nThe signatories of this submission call\nupon the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to enable, under\nthe revised National Planning Policy Framework, a presumption in favour of\nhousebuilding on Green Belt land within 1 Km (roughly a 10-minute walk) of a\ntube or train station giving access to London Zone 1 within 45 minute travel\ntime except for land falling into the exemptions outlined in this proposal.\nSubmission\nSignatories\nParliamentarians\nSiobhain McDonagh, Labour MP for Mitcham and\nMorden\nNick Boles, Conservative MP for Grantham and\nStamford\nRt Hon David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham\nChuka Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham\nSir Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP for\nWorthing West\nKaren Buck, Labour MP for Westminster North\nNeil Coyle, Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old\nSouthwark\nRt Hon Robert Halfon, Conservative MP for\nHarlow\nSeema Malhotra, Labour MP for Feltham and\nHeston\nRt Hon Dame Margaret Hodge, Labour MP for\nBarking\nDr Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and\nActon\nMarie Rimmer, Labour MP for St Helens South\nand Whiston\nLloyd Russell-Moyle, Labour MP for Brighton,\nKemptown\nMatt Western, Labour MP for Warwick and\nLeamington\nThe Rt Hon.

Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust are running yet another engagement that could see acute services including major A&E and consultant led maternity services lost from St Helier Hospital, Epsom Hospital, or both hospitals from 2020. I am wholeheartedly against these proposals.\nAlong with the local community, I have consistently campaigned for a fully operational and improved St Helier Hospital: keeping the hospital’s services at the heart of our community for the residents that rely on it.\nOne proposal is to improve St Helier on its current site. I would absolutely welcome any investment in St Helier Hospital, though I am concerned that there is no budget set aside for this and Daniel Elkeles, the Chief Executive of the Trust who is running the engagement, has even said privately that this is not his preferred option. He would like acute services to be based next to the Sutton Hospital site in Belmont rather than at St Helier Hospital. The statistics could not be clearer: the health needs of those living near St Helier Hospital are far, far greater than those living in either Epsom or Belmont. Moving acute services to these areas would be a case of taking them from an area of poor health to an area of considerably better health. That, I believe, would be absolutely wrong.\nWe have, of course, been here before. Consultation after consultation over the past 18 years have all identified the best outcome for these proposals to be improving St Helier Hospital. £37,070 has already been spent by the Trust on this new engagement process - funds that I believe should be spent on improving the hospital itself. I will do all I can to shout about this issue, but I need your help!\nWhat can you do?\n1. Attend my public meeting\nI will be hosting two public meetings on the 9th September. All are welcome:\n10:00am-11:00am, 9th September: Morden Park Baptist Church, Lower Morden Lane, SM4 4SP\n12:30pm-13:30pm, 9th September: Merton Civic Centre, London Road, Morden, SM4 5DX\n2. Write to the Trust\nPlease write to the Trust expressing your views. I will be writing to the Trust to argue that St Helier should remain fully operational on its current site.\nThe official consultation email is: esth2020-2030@nhs.uk. The deadline is 30th September.\nPlease send a copy of your letter to Siobhain@mmlp.org.uk or by post to 1 Crown Road, Morden, SM4 5DD.\n3. Tell your friends, family and neighbours\nPlease tell all those you can about this engagement so that the voices of Mitcham and Morden can be heard lour and clear. Share my videos on social media, encourage them to join us at our public meetings, ask them to write to the Trust.\nSt Helier Hospital should remain fully operational on its current site. Any funds available should be spent on the hospital and not on yet another consultation.",

In this edition, I’ll be mentioning a number of community groups with reason to celebrate, giving a plug for Mitcham Carnival and a sports initiative that will be launched there, and letting you have all the latest news on St Helier Hospital. And as it’s my first email since last month’s local council elections, I’ll also have some news on the results. So without further ado.... Join in the fun at Carnival – and get into sport while you’re at it! First of all, a quick reminder that on Saturday (14 June), it’s Mitcham Carnival. If you’ve never been before, there is always loads to do, from displays and a fun fair, to stalls run by local community groups. In fact, I’ll have a stand there too – why not pop along and say hello? This year, Mitcham Carnival includes wrestling displays, and a performance from X Factor star Gabz. For more details about all the entertainment on offer click here. And while you’re at Carnival, come and find out more about a new sports initiative that’s being launched there by Merton Council. Sports Blast has been set up to get young people and families involved in sport. It will offer through free courses and coaching for local residents, as well as regular sports sessions, with participants being recruited as coaches and offered qualification opportunities in the future. It’s a great partnership between Merton Council and Tooting and Mitcham United, Fulham Football Club, Surrey Tennis, England Netball, Merton BMX, Circle Housing Merton Priory, Moat and the YMCA, and has been made possible with financial help from Sport England. And in other sports related news, it’s great to see that Harris Academy Merton is offering free evening badminton and tennis sessions for the next 5 weeks, and don’t forget the Lavender Kickz football sessions run by Fulham FC and Uptown every Thursday from 7pm. Congratulations St Barnabas Church! Best wishes to Mitcham’s St Barnabas Church, which began celebrations of its centenary earlier this week. The church, on Thirsk Road in North Mitcham, was built in 1914 and is a Grade II listed building. It’s a lovely church, with a welcoming Vicar, Rev Joabe Cavalcanti, as well as a wonderful congregation. Good luck to everyone there as they celebrate this milestone. Results from the election for Merton Council In case you hadn’t heard, Labour were the victors at the local elections in Merton at the end of last month. All 30 of the Councillors in Mitcham and Morden are now representatives of the Labour Party. Well done to the Labour Leader of Merton Council, Councillor Stephen Alambritis. He’s done a good job over the past 4 years by freezing Council Tax and keeping the services we value most, even though Government grants to Councils have gone down. Stephen will now get on with the task of running Merton for the next 4 years, and says he will expand schools, maintain the weekly rubbish collection service, and keep your Council Tax frozen for another 4 years. As a former business leader, he’ll carry on running the Council in a businesslike way, and I’m sure we all wish him the best of luck – he’s got a big job to do! Merton also has a new Mayor – Councillor Agatha Akyigyina. Agatha was sworn in last week, and has already been to several civic events, including a thank you party for Merton’s foster carers and an awards ceremony for volunteers at local groups. Agatha works really hard in the community, and I’m sure she’ll be a fabulous Mayor. Good luck to her! More ups and downs at St Helier Earlier this week I spoke in Parliament again about St Helier. The situation is still very worrying, and I’m extremely unhappy about the way the issue is being handled by the Government. As you will have seen, one of the big issues during the local elections was the battle to Save St Helier. The community has been fighting a plan to shut St Helier’s A&E, maternity, ICU, children’s and renal units, as well as 390 in-patient beds, and members of the Lower Morden Save St Helier campaign stood as Labour candidates in order to ensure the campaign keeps a high profile. Earlier in the year, local health providers admitted the plan was “not viable”. However, we all knew that was only a reprieve. Indeed, Conservative and Lib Dem MPs have voted for a measure known as Clause 119, which makes it easier for the Government to press ahead with hospital closures. What we can’t have predicted was how short the reprieve would be. Just five days after local elections that had been dominated by the need to protect services at St Helier, a new 5 year plan was published that promised to “change the way we deliver health services”. Instead of listening to voters who wanted to keep St Helier going, the plan described the “likely need to reconfigure maternity and neonatal services” and said we would see “the introduction of two levels of emergency departments (Major Emergency Centre and Emergency Centre)”. The plans didn’t say which maternity units would be “reconfigured” (by which they mean closed) or which A&Es would be downgraded to Emergency Centres, rather than be fully blown Major Centres. But after the last few years I don’t think anyone believes St Helier’s future is safe. So I was pleased to see that Merton’s newly re-elected Leader, Councillor Stephen Alambritis, has called for heads to roll and demanded that the people who voted to Save St Helier are listened to. He has said he has no confidence in the local NHS and has told the Chair of Merton’s Clinical Commissioning Group his job is no longer tenable. Stephen described the plan to take services away from St Helier as a “fiasco” and said “The voters of Merton delivered a devastating verdict. Ultimately, responsibility lies with the Chair, and he has to go.” If he won’t step down, Stephen will write to the Health Secretary to say he should be sacked. Let’s hope the Government don’t ignore the verdict of the ballot box. Watch this space! A top award for local groups Finally, some good news. Two local groups have just been acknowledged with a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service. Merton’s Street Pastors and the Jeremiah Project have both been given the award by the Queen because of the contribution they make to our local community. Street Pastors are volunteers who patrol the streets at night to ensure everyone from the homeless to revellers who have had a drink too many are safe and looked after. You can get more details about their work here. The Jeremiah Project is a church-based charity that gives educational and pastoral support to local young people. Again, they’re well worth supporting. For more information about their work, including the Love Mitcham campaign they run, click here. Well done to both groups! And on that happy note, I’m off to start filling in my World Cup wallchart. By the next time I write, England will obviously be World champions*, so I hope you enjoy all the action. (*well, we can all dream can’t we…) As usual, if you want me to include anything in future emails please do contact me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. My best wishes,",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_fat-cat-friday_aspx/content_58.html": "By lunchtime on Friday 4th\nJanuary, the UK’s top Chief Executives had earned more than their average\nemployees would over the course of this entire year, taking home astronomical\nfigures more like telephone numbers than salaries.\nWhilst the average employee has seen\ntheir salary stagnate, the pay packet for a FTSE 100 CEO has risen by 11% over\nthe last year alone, soaring to a staggering average of £3.9 million per year.\nHow can that be right, just or fair?\nFor perspective, a FTSE 100 CEO is paid\nan estimated 132 times more than a police officer, 140 times more than a\nteacher, 165 times more than a nurse, and an astronomical 312 times more than a\ncare worker! These indefensible ratios are a slap in the face for hard-working employees\nacross our country who, at the very least, expect to take home a fair day’s pay\nfor a fair day’s work.\nFor some commentators, this is a debate about\nthose at the top being paid well. Others argue for a salary cap or for a\nwidespread cut to Chief Executive pay. My call is far simpler: for consistency,\nparity, and fairness. For the importance of the contribution of those at the\nbottom to be recognised in tandem with the contribution of those at the top. For\norganisations to determine the pay and reward schemes of all their\nemployees in one whole company pay policy.\nTake Sainsbury’s, a pillar of the Great\nBritish High Street. Under the guise of an ‘increase in basic pay’, Sainsbury’s\nis set to slash the salaries of 9,000 loyal and longstanding staff by up to\n£3,000 per year from 2020. And whilst new contracts for shopfloor staff will\nsee their bonus scheme scrapped, CEO Mike Coupe takes home an eye watering\nbonus of £427,000 as part of his £3.4 million pay packet. This is a monumental\ninjustice that, I believe, would have been prevented had the Sainsbury’s\nRemuneration Committee considered the pay and reward scheme for all employees\nat the same time in one whole company pay policy.\nI’m not calling for extraordinary\nexecutive incentives like this to be scrapped. I appreciate the demands of\nrunning one of the UK’s biggest organisations. But if an incentive scheme is\nmade available for some staff then it should be on offer for all staff, on the\nsame terms, within the organisation. Why should any organisation have a rule for\nsome employees that is not a rule for all?\nBut inconsistency and injustice has\ngrown to become the norm throughout the FTSE 100, and across the high street,\nwith treasured organisations like Marks and Spencer and B&Q falling foul of\nthe expectation of organisational fairness. It is the absence of a whole\ncompany pay policy in organisations like these that has led to this unjust\ndisparity.\nThe Government has introduced\nregulations to enforce organisations to disclose and explain their pay ratios.\nThis is a small step. But how will this ensure that such extreme pay ratios do\nnot occur in the first place? And what will happen if, and when, they are shown\nto continue?\nThat’s why I brought a debate on ‘Fat Cat\nFriday’ to Parliament. The enforcement of whole company pay policies would be the\nfirst step back to a country where hard working employees can expect to receive\na fair deal at work.\n(This\npiece was previously written for ‘The House’ magazine).",

Wetherspoon is planning to close the popular The White Lion of Mortimer at the heart of Mitcham.\nShow Wetherspoons just how much we value our community pub and sign the petition here!\nSign online here:\nUpdate so far:\nThree Wetherspoon pubs in south-west London and north Surrey are among 33 in London put up for sale by the chain: Walton's Regent, Putney's Railway and Mitcham's White Lion of Mortimer Wetherspoon\nA Wetherspoons spokesman said the pubs will 'continue to run as normal until or if [they] will be sold.’ - Other London Wetherspoon pubs to close include branches in Dagenham, Forest Hill, Fulham, Hammermith, Islington, and North Finchley\nBut recently there’s been a huge amount of investment in Mitcham Town center, the benefit of which will be felt by the White Lion soon - so far a total of £6m investment by council. And now the ‘Rediscover Mitcham’ town centre regeneration project will see the development of a new bus street on London Road, which is due to start this summer. This follows the release of funding from Transport for London in line with the Mayor of London’s, London’s Great Outdoors programme.\nThe demand for places to go and things to do in Mitcham is rising rapidly.\n- The average age of people living in Cricket Green ward is now under 35.\n- Ethnic diversity has increased by over 50% since 2001.\n- New Housing developments such as on the old gasworks site are drawing new people into the area. This is generating new demands and Mitcham is changing.\n- In recent years, Figges Marsh & Cricket Green percentage of economically active people (more likely to have disposable income) has increased by 4%, to 71%\nThe situation of JD Wetherspoon's profits is more complex. In 2015, it reported a 25% fall in pretax profits to £58.7m despite a rise in like-for-like sales of 3.3% The owner has cited the introduction of the National Living Wage as the reason why so many underperforming pubs will have to close. He has also cited that the ‘price differential’ especially in poorer areas means that already under performing pubs are doing so much worse (cheap alcohol in supermarkets undercutting Wetherspoon prices)\nHe has stressed that pub wages represent about 30% of sales and a pint purchased in a pub at the national average price of about £3.50 will represent about 85p in wages. “In contrast, a pint bought in a supermarket, at an estimated price of £1, will only represent about 10 pence of supermarket wages, since their wage percentage and selling prices are both far lower those of pubs,” he said.\nMartin has long campaigned about the disparity between pubs being charged 20% VAT on food sales while supermarkets are charged nothing, allowing the big grocers to subsidise alcohol sales. But at the same time, Wetherspoons has opened five new pubs and sold two over the course of the last financial year o Wetherspoon has defied the decline of the pub industry in Britain by charging low prices, serving food and coffee and extending opening hours, but the feeling is company had little room for manoeuvre on prices or staff costs.\nBUT Tim Martin, Wetherspoon founder, should be much brighter with the Brexit outcome he campaigned for. Mr Martin said Wetherspoons was hit badly by tax disparity between supermarkets and pubs as he issued a plea to George Osborne, the Chancellor, to ease the tax burden on the \"overtaxed\" industry. - Tim Martin visits at least 10 Wetherspoon pubs a week – could he come to Mitcham to meet Siobhain and see its potential?\nSign the petition above or at this link - and please share widely!",

This month’s news includes headline news about the FREE Gas & Electricity Exhibition for local residents on Saturday 18th October as well as news and other events and updates so even though the nights are drawing in there is a lot happening.\nHow to cut your gas and electricity bills\nAre you paying too much for your gas or electricity? Could you simply get a better deal? Come along to my FREE gas and electricity day on Saturday 18 October to meet your supplier and check your tariff. Please bring old gas and electricity bills with you to get the best from this service.\nAlong with a variety of stands giving helpful advice I’ll host a ‘Question & Answer Session’ with Adam Scorer, one of the UK’s leading experts, who will give you easy tips on how to make the most of your gas and electricity.\nWe’ll also have a representative from Smart Energy GB. They will tell you about the new ‘Smart Meters’ that are being installed in all homes over the next 5 years. ‘Smart Meters’ come with a kitchen monitor that show your gas and electricity use in pounds and pence each hour, day, week, doing away with the need to understand kilowatt hours!\n‘Smart Meters’ are installed FREE in your home and show your electricity use in real time, so there’s no need for estimated bills or meter readers. The monitors also alert you about appliances that are left on and will compare your energy use with similar homes so you know if you spend more than you need to. Unfortunately they won’t cook your dinner!\nAs well as that advice on saving money, we will have a wide variety of advice on housing and finance. Weather permitting there’ll also be lots for the kids to do including bouncy castles and, in the morning, sports coaching. There will be something for everyone at The Hub, Bishopsford Rd, Mitcham on Saturday 18 October between 10am and 4pm\nGetting the police to deliver a better service in Mitcham\nThanks again to the more than 200 people who came along to the public meeting about crime that I organised in August. This certainly helped to get our message across to the police about tackling anti-social behaviour in Mitcham. The street drinkers are at the centre of our concerns with their antisocial and unacceptable behaviour including aggressive begging, abuse and littering.\nI have since met with PC Neil Phillips and he is ready to apply for ASBOs (Anti-Social Behaviour Orders) to be issued against the main offenders. Although I have passed on your concerns to him, he is keen to hear from residents directly. If you are prepared to give a statement you can email him at neil.j.phillips@met.police.uk\nTogether I hope we are making Mitcham town centre a better and safer place.\nNew Clinic for Mitcham\nNHS Merton Clinical Commissioning Group is planning to open a new clinic to serve the people of Mitcham. This is exciting and is good news for the residents of Mitcham as it will improve access to health services closer to home. The sites they are considering are Birches Close, Raleigh Gardens, Sibthorpe Road and Wilson Hospital.\nIf you would like to find out more about the plans you can visit the Merton CCG website. They are in the process of gathering views from the public to help them make their decision. You can have your say by taking part in the online survey.\nFree job employment workshops\nNeed help with your CV, writing covering letters, and interview skills? Christians Against Poverty Merton Job Club are running weekly free job employment workshops covering these topics and many more.\nThe workshops take place at Cricket Green primary School, Lower Green West, Mitcham CR4 3AF from 9.30am to 12.30pm on Fridays for a period of 8 weeks.\nFor more information contact Jerry Frempong on 07957 403 750 or by email jerryfrempong@capuk.org\nMitcham Imperials FC awarded a grant\nThe Football Foundation have awarded the club with a £950 grant under the Grow the Game club development scheme. This will enable the club to create a new team for young players and keep the tradition of the 11 a side game.\nThis takes the total of grants awarded by the Football Foundation to small clubs in Mitcham and Morden to more than £10 000 over the past 5 years – great news for our young people.\nRecycle for “Count The Kicks”\nMitcham and Morden resident Corinne Garrod is collecting other peoples’ rubbish and helping to turn it into much needed funds for UK pregnancy charity Count the Kicks.\nCount the Kicks is one of the UK’s leading pregnancy charities which aims to drastically reduce the number of families that experience the tragedy of a stillbirth. By educating expectant mums on the importance of monitoring their unborn baby’s movements, the charity aim to cut the number of stillbirths by a third from its estimated current level of 17 a day in the UK.\nThey raise funds through a recycling scheme across the UK collecting baby wipe packets, baby food pouches, Tassimo coffee pods, sweet biscuit wrappers, used stamps, printer ink cartridges clothes and shoes.\nIf you would like further information on Count The Kicks there is a wealth of information on their website and their Facebook pages. To donate items please contact Corinne ctkrecyclingmerton@gmail.com\nI hope to see you at the Gas and Electricity day.

I’ve got details about summer fairs taking place around the community throughout July, an update from one of our children’s sports teams, and news about a meeting I’ve organised to improve one of our local parks. But first, I want to let you know more about what I’m doing to battle against local police cuts. Join me at a meeting to tell the police we want a better service in Mitcham Over the past few weeks, there have been a series of high profile crimes in Mitcham, including an attempted murder in the town centre, a rape on one of the pathways into Colliers Wood, and a stabbing in Pollards Hill. I’ve also received lots of complaints about anti-social behaviour, drinking and even drug taking, largely connected to the betting shops and barbers in the centre of Mitcham itself. At the same time, according to recent figures, the number of unsolved crimes in Merton is up 78%, and we have lost more than 40 Police Constables and nearly half our PCSOs since 2010. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has made changes to the police service, and neighbourhood policing in Merton has switched from a system where 6 dedicated officers worked in each of Merton's 20 wards, to one where teams work in just 3 centralised sectors. This has led to a reduction in policing for Mitcham because even though 52% of crime takes place in Mitcham, resources are split evenly across the three sectors. Mitcham’s neighbourhood officers have also taken on responsibilities that were previously carried out by other police officers, including Vehicle Checks, Drug Stops, Licensed premises visits, and so on. So I’ve called a meeting for you to talk to the police about what more they can do. I’ve invited the head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Bernard Hogan Howe, as well as the Chief Executives of Ladbrokes, Betfred and Paddy Power. This is your chance to tell them how they can make Mitcham safer and better, so it would be great if you could come. The meeting is at 10am on Saturday 2 August, in St Mark’s Church on St Mark’s Road in Mitcham. I will be there too, along with your local Councillors. It’s our chance to get the police to do a better job in Mitcham, so I hope to see you there! Morden Little League go Dutch – and win! After last month’s newsletter publicised a number of local sports initiatives, including Merton Council’s fantastic new Sports Blast project, I thought I should mention one of our local sports clubs in particular. Morden Little League was founded in 1968 and is the oldest and largest little league in the country. It offers football for players of all abilities for children from school years 2 to 8 for boys, or 2 to 9 for girls. Most of all, it is great fun, but I’ve just heard news about some tournament success for them over in Holland. We’ve not had too much football to celebrate in the past few weeks, so it is good to hear that Morden’s players did us proud. After losing their first game, they went on to win their next four games – well done to everyone who was involved! Improving Ravensbury Park Most of the time Ravensbury Park is a great place for families to visit. However, recently I’ve been contacted by a number of people who are concerned about litter, especially at weekends, and about grass cutting. So, together with your Councillors I have asked Merton Council staff to look at how they can improve the park. For instance, although litter is caused by a handful of thoughtless people who don’t care about our park as much as the rest of us, can more be done to provide extra bins or litter collection services, and can grass be cut more often? I’d like to invite you to a site meeting I’ve organised at 9am this Thursday (10 July) which will be attended by officials from Merton Council, along with the local Councillors – including the excellent Leader of Merton Council and Ravensbury Councillor, Stephen Alambritis. We will also be joined by representatives from the local police force, who can advise what they can do to reduce the anti-social behaviour that affects parts of the park from time to time and makes it a less pleasant place to visit. We’ll meet outside the entrance to the GP surgery on Morden Road before heading into the park for a walkabout, so please do come if you possibly can. I appreciate it is very soon, so if you cannot make it and have any questions you would like to raise, please email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk and I will make sure you get a reply. It would be good to have your ideas and input on what more can be done. Enjoy a Mitcham and Morden summer! Finally, I’ve got news about a number of summer fairs taking place over the next few weeks, starting this Saturday, 12 July, when there are a couple of events in Colliers Wood. It’s Parish Fun Day from noon until 4pm at St Joseph’s Church in Colliers Wood, which is always a spectacular afternoon of fun. Before that, Singlegate Primary School is holding its summer fair, which will include an attempt to break the world record for the most people doing sit-ups simultaneously. The current record is 263 and they are looking for people to take part – don’t worry, it doesn't matter how many you do – so if you are interested, please sign up at www.singlegatesummerfair.splashthat.com. You then need to register at 10.30am on the day in the field opposite the school! After record attempt you can enjoy all the stalls, BBQ and musical entertainment at the fair. And don’t forget it’s Morden Fun Day on Sunday 20 July. Organised by the Rotary Club of Morden, it runs from 11am to 5pm in Morden Park, and is set to be an exciting, action packed day for all the family. There’ll be stalls and activities run by local clubs and charities, with play areas and Bouncy Castle for younger visitors and all sorts of activities including Football, Cheerleading, BMX Bike Displays, Martial Arts, an Assault Course, Zumba, Tap Dancing, Belly Dancing, a Dog Show, and Fencing and Archery. There’ll even be a stall for your local Labour Councillors – so why not pop along and say hello! And on that summery note, I’ll sign off for another month. Please get in touch if you’ve any comments or thoughts about what I can include in future emails – just email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. My best wishes,",

Some 1,530 children benefit from the programme each day across our constituency, but thousands of others also benefit. An independent study suggests that every child in a school on the scheme gets two months’ extra learning in reading and maths over the course of a year compared to children in schools with no such provision in place. Not only are the children fed, which helps them to concentrate, but their behaviour, their punctuality and their attendance improves.\nMrs Kennedy, headteacher at St Marks Primary School commented that: “We cannot imagine being without this initiative, having seen the impact it has on our pupils, their energy levels and consequently their ability to access morning lessons... We’ve also seen a significant improvement in punctuality as well as overall attendance.”\nThe importance of the programme could not be clearer. But it is under threat.\nThis scheme is currently paid for from the sugar tax. There is currently £123 million of sugar tax money at the Treasury waiting to be spent and yet this scheme ends in March 2020. Would it not make so much sense to allocate some of the money that is already there to extend this brilliant programme?\nIf your child or school benefits from the programme and you would like to support my campaign, please don't hesitate to contact me at mcdonaghs@parliament.uk.",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_mitcham-morden_monthly-newsletter_jan-14_aspx/content_107.html": "January 2014 Home / Mitcham and Morden / Newsletters / January 2014 Dear friend, Hello, happy new year and welcome again to my latest email about all the latest news and events here in Mitcham and Morden. This month I have yet another update about St Helier Hospital, some worrying figures about policing, and a long list of people to thank for all the hard work they do to make this such a fantastic local community. So let’s get started.... The latest twists and turns at St Helier And as if by magic, the new year has seen yet another twist in the Save St Helier campaign. As you know, the community has been fighting the threat to shut St Helier’s A&E, maternity, ICU, children’s and renal units, as well as 390 in-patient beds – all because our local NHS has to save £370m a year. Well, earlier this week local health providers finally admitted the plan is “not viable”. That’s largely because residents and Councillors in Lewisham won a court case against the Government over the closure of their local hospital. The court ruled that if a number of GPs are against a hospital closure they can stop it happening. However, although it’s fantastic news that residents won their court case against the Government, unfortunately in December Conservative and Lib Dem MPs voted to make it harder for anyone to block future hospital closures. If the House of Lords votes the same way, the new rules will come into effect later this year. That’s a really worrying prospect. At the same time, the body behind the proposals to shut services at St Helier have insisted that they still need to do something, saying “the challenges outlined in the case for change remain... and we hope to make a further announcement in February”. So it looks as though this is a reprieve rather than an outright victory. Every time we win a battle, they keep coming back for more. Anyway, thank you for all the support you’ve given the Save St Helier campaign. This one will run and run! We’ll obviously have to wait and see what they say in February, but it really is thanks to all the work that we have done as a community that we’ve been this successful so far. Please keep up the good work! Worried about policing? Let them know what you think! According to the latest figures, the number of unsolved crimes in Merton is up 78%, and we have lost more than 40 Police Constables and nearly half our PCSOs since 2010. If, like me, you are worried about plans for fewer police across the Borough, you might like to join me next Tuesday, 14 January Merton at the Civic Centre in Morden. The Metropolitan Police are holding an open meeting for residents to give feedback about their service. It starts at 6.30pm and it would be great to see you there. I hope to see you there! Congratulations St Mark’s Primary Meanwhile, the past month has seen some great news from one of our local schools. St Mark’s Primary school in the heart of Mitcham has made the headlines by being named in the Evening Standard’s list of the top 10 primary schools in London. That’s an amazing achievement! I have already written to the school to say how happy I am about this news, and to congratulate all the staff, parents and pupils who contributed so much to this. It really is fantastic. I’m also very pleased to say that the successful chain of Harris Academy schools will soon be taking over Garden Primary School in Pollards Hill. They’ve a great track record of improving schools, and I do think they will prove a success again. Good luck to everyone there. Will you need help with housing in 2014? The new year has started with some very worrying data from the homelessness charity Shelter, who say that one in eleven people fear they won’t be able to afford to pay the rent or mortgage at the end of this month. Sadly, Shelter also say that many people in this situation feel too ashamed to ask for help. They have asked me to encourage anyone who might be at risk, or knows anyone who might be at risk, to seek advice quickly to avoid problems spiralling out of control. Shelter offers a very good online advice service at www.shelter.org.uk/get_advice and also has a free telephone helpline number, 0808 800 4444. Please do think about getting in touch. Everyone knows that these are difficult times for many people financially, and there is absolutely no shame in getting advice. Thanks to everyone who gave at Christmas Finally, I just wanted to say a big thank you to all the many local volunteers who worked so hard to help others over Christmas. In particular, Doxa Deo church provided more than 500 hampers for the poorest people in our community, some of which I helped deliver. Thank you also to Faith in Action for organising and cooking another Christmas dinner at Mitcham Parish Centre for people who had no family or friends to spend the day with. This is a fabulous community, and there are so many people who work hard to keep it that way. Thank you to all of you! And on that happy note, I’d better sign off. Have a very happy new year – and as always if you can think of anything I can include in future newsletters please do email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. See you next month! My best wishes, Siobhain",

Less than 5 months later, the Government's Child Poverty Unit was axed.\nLast month, I received the incredibly saddening news from End Child Poverty coalition that a staggering 32% of the children in my constituency of Mitcham and Morden are living in poverty. They are 8,598 of the 700,000 children across our capital who are living below the poverty line, defined as a minimum acceptable standard of living. In fact, there are now constituencies in London where more than half of children are growing up in poverty. I felt so strongly about this deplorable issue that I organised for a debate in Parliament.\nA childhood in poverty often leads to an adulthood in poverty, a shorter and less fruitful life. And no, work is no longer the best route out of poverty, as the majority of children in poverty grow up in a working household.\nAt the debate, I read a letter that I have received from a local Head Teacher. In it, she outlined so many extraordinarily sad examples of child poverty in her school. When a child lost his reading book, she encouraged him to look under his bed. His reply, 'I don't have a bed to look under'. At lunchtime she sees children eating their lunch very quickly, protecting their plate with an arm as they eat. And when one child was asked what he would do if he won the lottery, he would buy lots of bread and porridge as that is what fills you up.\nAnd so, I asked the Government Minister directly in the debate why they are not acting to ensure that the letters of a postcode will not be the determining factor in a child's life.\nYou can watch my speech and the solutions I proposed here:",

  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_energybills_aspx/content_19.html": "Cut energy bills Home / Campaigns / Cut energy bills Gas and electricity bills are now the biggest monthly outgoing for many households. That's why Siobhain is calling for energy companies to be forced by law to guarantee that elderly customers get the cheapest tariff for their gas and electricity. Although competition is in theory good for consumers, the wide variety of complicated tariffs - many of which are only available online - it's estimated that 80% of people are still overpaying for their gas and electricity. As the people who are least likely to get a deal online are the elderly, Siobhain wants all energy companies to automatically put households on the cheapest tariff if the people living there are 75 or more. Siobhain says this is an issue of delivering fairness in these tough times, and is urging people to sign up to the campaign. The Government have so far refused to change the rules, but Siobhain hopes that public pressure can make a difference. And of course, Siobhain is backing Ed Miliband's plan to freeze fuel bills under a Labour Government. You can sign up to the campaign below - but in the mean time Siobhain says there are a few things you can do to reduce your bills. The Big London Energy Switch If you think you might be paying too much for your gas or electricity, Merton Council is supporting a scheme to help residents get a better deal. The Big London Energy Switch works by gathering together people from across London who want to cheaper bills. Once enough people register, energy companies will be invited to offer deals to all those who register. Whoever offers the cheapest tariff gets to offer you a new contract, and once you have seen how much money you can save you will be able to decide whether to accept the offer or not. Savings depend on how much energy you use and on your current tariff - if you’ve recently switched you may be on the best value tariff already. But there is no obligation to accept the offer. A similar scheme has seen yearly savings of £60 to £200 per household, so there is nothing to lose. You can register directly here. And hurry – you have to register by 8 April to take advantage! Free Replacement Boilers In a similar vein, the “Affordable Warmth” scheme, which is also known as ECO (the energy companies obligation), is designed to make energy companies cut carbon emissions and there is £300 million from them to install new condensing boilers for free for older people and people on low wages. So if you are in receipt of Pension credit or Child tax credit (and your income is less than £15,860) why not find out more. You can get further details here. The same scheme might also help you get free loft or cavity insulation. To talk to someone about applying you can call local firm Glowarm on 020 8685 9498 and ask to speak to the ECO Grant department. You can also ring the Energy Saving Advice Service on 0300 123 1234.

Anyone who’s been unemployed soon after leaving school or university will remember how dispiriting it is not to know where that first opportunity is going to come from. So I launched this Work Experience scheme back in 2011 to help young people in Mitcham & Morden get the experience they need to find the career they want. Take a look at the 2015/16 Work Experience Booklet here We are fortunate to have 65 participating employers who are offering over 100 opportunities for people aged 18-24 years old in the constituency, covering everything from law experience to social care, retail to accountancy, and construction to medicine - and many more. In sum, these placements offer something for all young people whatever their skills, talents or exam results. Opportunities are designed for young people aged 18-24 but we won’t turn away those trying to find work who are older. However, to be eligible to apply, applicants must live in the constituency of Mitcham & Morden. The placements begin in January 2016 and last for a minimum of 8 weeks. The placement work experience is unpaid, but I’ve been running these schemes for 5 years now and they’ve led to hundreds of young people getting into full-time paid employment. If you know a young person trying to find work please tell them about this scheme, and advise them to do the following: Take a look at our Work Experience Placement booklet that lists all of the opportunities that are available - and decide on a role that you think is right for you Call Billy Christie on 020 8542 4835 or email billy@mmlp.org.uk for a reference number.

At this event there will be lots of information on how to get the best from this opportunity along with advice on interview techniques. We’ll also hear from Ann-Marie who has been on the scheme and can tell you about her experience. The morning lasts for two hours from 11am to 1pm. Coffee will be served from 10.45am with a FREE lunch at 1pm so participants can chat with us informally and ask questions. Anyone wanting to come along should book their place by calling 020 8542 4835 or emailing billy@mmlp.org.uk.

  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_mitcham-morden_monthly-newsletter_july-2013_aspx/content_108.html": "July 2013 Home / Mitcham and Morden / Newsletters / July 2013 Dear friend, Welcome to my latest newsletter about all that’s going on in Mitcham, Morden and Colliers Wood. I hope that you’re enjoying the warm weather – it probably won’t last long! There are loads of good things to do when you live in an area like ours, from walking across the historic Morden Hall Park to splashing about in one of our paddling pools. But I’m not here to give you the weather forecast. It might be what most journalists call ‘silly season’, but there’s plenty of news affecting us here in Mitcham and Morden. Most important is a major story that could help us protect our local hospitals St Helier and St George’s. So without further ado... A&E closures – the courts have their say... In case you didn’t notice the news, earlier this week the High Court ruled that the Government’s decision to shut the A&E at Lewisham Hospital was unlawful (see here for details). As you probably know, the A&Es – and various other units, like maternity, renal services and paediatrics – at St Helier, Epsom and Croydon Hospitals are under threat too, and closures there will lead to even more overcrowding at our other local hospital St George’s. So what does the High Court decision mean for us? Well, at the moment it’s hard to say, but it’s obviously a fantastic victory for campaigners who want to save the NHS. The High Court decided that the Government had acted unlawfully when it announced Lewisham would shut because GPs wanted to keep it open, and the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had ignored them. That just goes to show how important it is to persuade GPs to back the Save St Helier campaign. So whatever else you do this summer, please contact your GP and beg them to write to our local NHS (known as Merton CCG) opposing the closure of St Helier. Your GP is now your representative within the NHS, and if they don’t cast their vote to Save St Helier, we will probably lose – so make it your summer resolution to get in touch, and let me know what they say! Thank you to everyone for your continuing to do all you can to Save St Helier. If the cuts go ahead, we will lose our intensive care unit, our neonatal unit, our children’s services, our renal unit and about half our 390 in-patient beds as well as our A&E and maternity unit. That sort of disruption is bound to have a devastating impact on St George’s, which is already near bursting point. And following the news that our local 111 service is in turmoil (read about it here), the last thing we need is any further cuts to our local NHS! Fight for Change There are so many groups and clubs offering activities for young people. To check out a few, please have a look at the Directory I produced a few months ago highlighting what a wide range of things there are for them to do. You can read it on my website here. Last week, I was lucky enough to go to the launch of a project run by Fight for Change in Phipps Bridge. Fight for Change was set up by boxing legend Richie Woodhall, and is designed to give young people at risk of getting into trouble something better to do. Thanks to funding from the Rio Ferdinand Foundation and the Evening Standard Dispossessed Fund and the support of the police, the project has now moved into Mitcham. It will offer activities and a personal development programme based around boxing, and hopefully this will lead to the young people getting employment or training opportunities in the future. Good luck to everyone involved! Big thanks for a longstanding public servant With it being the end of term, a number of long-serving teachers and school staff are reaching retirement. Good luck and thanks to you all! It seems unfair to single anyone out, but as I’ve just mentioned Phipps Bridge, Alison Henshall, the retiring Deputy Head at Haslemere Primary School, deserves a particular word of thanks. She has worked so hard to make Phipps Bridge a great place for young people to grow up. In addition to her sterling efforts in making sure Haslemere is one of our top primary schools, her involvement in the Friends of Phipps Bridge is worthy of the highest praise. Good luck Alison, and every other retiring public servant. You’ve served our community proud! Local Park one of best in country As I mentioned at the start of this email, there are lots of great places to visit in Mitcham and Morden, especially when the weather’s nice (you can read more in my “Welcome to Mitcham and Morden booklet”, available on my website here). Apparently, this is “Love Parks Week”, and I’m pleased to say that one of our local parks, Colliers Wood Recreation Ground, has just been granted a prestigious Green Flag award as one of the best parks in the country. You can find out more here. Having grown up in Colliers Wood, I’ve got many happy memories of the Rec, and I’m pleased that it’s going from strength to strength. Despite all the savings they are having to make, Merton Council has protected the Rec’s paddling pool, and the community has done a great job making it a lovely place to visit. Good Luck Caroline! Talking of Colliers Wood, I couldn’t go without mentioning my friend Caroline Cooper-Marbiah, who is standing for election in Colliers Wood next Thursday. I’ve said many times that we live in a strong community, and Caroline epitomises that. She helped set up a residents association in the Crusoe Road area of Colliers Wood, in order to deal with anti-social behaviour that was taking place there, and she’s got things done. She works in finance, and her degree is in accountancy, and I’m sure that’ll come in handy too, given how important it is for Councils to make their money stretch a little bit further. Yes, I know, I’m sorry to throw a bit of politics into this little community newsletter, but if you live in the Colliers Wood area, please do remember to vote, whoever it is for. I’ve expressed strong views on the importance of registering to vote (read more here). This election is taking place due to the death of Gam Gurung, a brave man who served this country in the armed forces as a Gurkha. Our troops are prepared to sacrifice so much for the democracy we sometimes take for granted, so if you want to honour his memory, please do vote. In the mean time, if you want to find out more about why I’m backing Caroline, please click here. And if you want to find out more about her campaign she’s on Facebook here. Anyway, let’s hope the sun stays out a little longer, so that we can all enjoy a relaxing summer. If you’ve got any ideas for events or stories about other local people or groups to go in my next newsletter please email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. My best wishes,",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_community-policing_aspx/content_42.html": "Mitcham and Morden was one of the first places in the country to introduce community policing, and Safer Neighbourhood Police Teams remain popular. But Siobhain fears this model of community policing is under threat.\nThe Mayor of London is consulting about replacing Safer Neighbourhood Teams of 6 officers (1 Sergeant, 2 PCs, and 3 PCSOs) permanently based in every neighbourhood with a centralised group of officers who constantly move around.\nThe total number of officers in London will also be lower, with at least 1,100 fewer Sergeants and senior Police Officers, and over 900 fewer PCSOs. The Mayor claims these will be partly offset by an extra 1,279 PCs, but it is expected that many of these will be junior staff or recently promoted PCSOs.\nThe reduction in Mitcham and Morden could be greater than elsewhere, because resources will be focused on high-crime Boroughs, and Merton as a whole has below average crime levels.\nMeanwhile, the Mayor is proposing to close the 24-hour police counter at Mitcham Police Station, and the police are also considering shutting local Safer Neighbourhood Team offices across the Borough.\nThe fear is that the Mayor's proposals will result in the police losing its connection with local communities, just like they did in the 70s, 80s and 90s, when the police preferred to sit centrally in police stations or cars rather than walk the street talking to local people.\nIf you want to join the campaign to protect local police services, please fill out your details below, and Siobhain will sign you up.",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_st-helier-hospital_aspx/content_14.html": "Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust's are coming to the end of an engagement process that could see acute services lost from either St Helier Hospital, Epsom Hospital or even both hospitals from 2020.\nThe Trust propose bringing all acute services in their catchment area under one roof. This includes major A&E and consultant led maternity services. The engagement deadline is 30th September 2017 and all responses should be directed to esth2020-2030@nhs.uk.\nBelow you can find Siobhain's official response to the Trust:\nESTH 2020-2030\nEpsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust\n4th Floor Ferguson House\nSt Helier Hospital\nWrythe Lane\nCarshalton\nSurrey SM5 1AA\n25 September\n2017\nEpsom and St Helier\n2020-2030\nDear Mr\nElkeles,\nI am writing\nin response to your ongoing engagement named Epsom and St Helier 2020-2030 and I\nwould be grateful if you could include this as my official response to the\nprocess.\nAs I\nunderstand it, St Helier Hospital is at risk of losing all acute services\nincluding major accident and emergency as well as consultant led maternity\nservices in two-thirds of your proposals. I am wholly against an engagement\nprocess that could leave St Helier Hospital's acute services at threat.\nI have\nundertaken a detailed analysis of a 1 mile radius surrounding each of the three\nproposed sites for the hospital catchment area’s acute services (Rose Hill,\nEpsom and Belmont). The statistics are shockingly definitive in that the site\nrequiring any investment is Rose Hill and that, most importantly, St Helier\nHospital simply cannot afford to lose its acute services or put them at risk.\nHealth\nThere are 3,465 people with ‘bad’ or ‘very bad’ health living\nwithin a mile of St Helier compared to just 1,525 living an equivalent distance\nin Belmont and 937 in Epsom. Moving acute services from Rose Hill to Epsom or Belmont\nwould literally be moving them from an area with statistically bad health to an\narea with better health. That goes against every principle of a hospital’s\npurpose.\nCurrently, both St Helier Hospital and Epsom Hospital have\nacute services and yet these services are used far more frequently at St\nHelier. In 2015, St Helier had 21,428 adult A&E admissions compared to\n14,039 in Epsom. In the same year, St Helier had 22,555 paediatric A&E\nattendances compared to 14,721 paediatric A&E attendances at Epsom. A loss\nof major A&E would clearly be disproportionately damaging to the residents\nliving near St Helier considering that statistically poor health has resulted\nin a significant demand on local acute services.\nSimilarly, the maternity facilities at St Helier are in\nconsiderably more demand than at Epsom. In 2015, 2,987 babies were born at St\nHelier compared to 1,988 at Epsom Hospital. This is unsurprising considering there\nare 2,310 females between 15-39 (the age bracket most likely to need consultant\nled maternity services) living a mile from St Helier Hospital, whereas there\nare only 1,320 the same distance around the proposed site in Sutton and 1,045\naround Epsom. Moving consultant led maternity from Rose Hill to Epsom or\nBelmont would mean moving them from an area with a far higher need for the services\nto one with far less need.\nFurthermore, according to Public Health England, 38% of the\nneighbourhoods within a mile of St Helier Hospital are considered to be in the\n40% most deprived neighbourhoods for health across the country. There are no\nsuch neighbourhoods an equivalent distance to Epsom Hospital and just 13% of\nneighbourhoods considered as deprived for health within a mile of the site at\nBelmont.\nThe statistics on health could not be clearer: acute services\nare in far greater need at St Helier’s current site in Rose Hill. Moving these\nservices on this knowledge would be simply unjustifiable.\nLocal\nPopulation\n70,154 people live within a mile of St Helier Hospital,\ncompared to 28,691 living an equivalent distance to the site in Epsom and\n39,297 in Belmont. Of these, there are 15,053 dependent children within a mile\nof St Helier Hospital compared to 5,715 in Epsom and 6,851 in Belmont.\nSimilarly, 12,121 people over the age of 60 live within a mile of St Helier\nHospital compared to 6,801 in Epsom and 9,931 in Belmont. These dependent\nchildren and elderly residents are precisely the groups that are most likely to\nneed quick and easy access to local acute services.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the acute services are currently\nused by considerably more people at St Helier Hospital than at Epsom Hospital,\nillustrating both the demand and their importance. Considering the stark differences\nin the local population sizes, it is unlikely that this demand will change. A\nloss of acute services at St Helier would therefore impact the lives of\nconsiderably more people than in either Epsom or Belmont, moving services\nincluding major A&E and consultant led maternity services further away from\na much larger number of people.\nTravel\n14,335 people living within a mile of St Helier do not have a\ncar in their household. This is almost 3 times the number of people without\ntransport an equivalent distance in Belmont and 5 times the number in Epsom.\nFor people without transport, the time it would take them to travel to access\ntheir local acute service is of upmost importance.\nFortunately, there are 7 different bus routes to St Helier\nHospital, with 5 running every 12 minutes or faster in peak time. Of the 7\nroutes, 4 stop directly at the hospital. There is also a local tube station in\nMorden and the 157 bus route connects St Helier Hospital with Morden station in\njust 10 minutes.\nTravelling from Rose Hill to either Epsom or Belmont is\nsignificantly more difficult. To travel by bus from Rose Hill to Epsom Hospital\nrequires 2 buses and takes over an hour. Travelling by bus to Belmont requires\na 20 minute bus and a 15 minute walk. For those who cannot walk this distance\n(the case for the majority of those needing to access acute services), the bus\ntakes half an hour. There are no tube stops supporting either Epsom or Belmont.\nFor a resident who needs to reach the hospital quickly to\naccess its acute services, how quickly they can reach them should be one of\nyour upmost priorities. Not only does the local area to St Helier have a\nsignificantly larger population than Epsom or Belmont, but this population is\nsignificantly more dependent on strong local transport links to their nearest\nacute services. If acute services were to only be in Epsom or Belmont, a\nsignificantly larger number of residents without access to a car would struggle\nto access them quickly and easily.\nJobs and\nEconomic Consequences\nA loss of acute services at St Helier Hospital would have a\ndetrimental knock on effect on jobs and the local economy. St Helier Hospital\nis the biggest employer for the local area and, in addition, brings many people\nincluding staff, patients and visitors to Rose Hill who support the local\nbusinesses, shops and cafés. The precinct has recently lost both a Co-op and a\nPost Office and if services were to be downgraded or removed from Rose Hill,\nthere would be a dramatic impact on the area which already has a large number\nof households without work.\nHalf of the neighbourhoods within a mile of St Helier’s\ncurrent site are considered to be in the 40% most deprived neighbourhoods for\nemployment. And that’s with a fully\noperational St Helier Hospital. Comparatively, there are no neighbourhoods\nwithin a mile of Epsom Hospital considered to be in the 40% most deprived for\nemployment, and just 8% of the neighbourhoods within a mile of Belmont meet\nthis deprivation.\nThe local economy to St Helier Hospital is already far worse\noff for employment than either Belmont or Epsom and it is dependent on a fully\noperational St Helier Hospital. The impact, therefore, that the downgrading of\nSt Helier Hospital would have on the local area is significant.\nSt George’s\nHospital and Croydon University Hospital\nSt George’s Hospital is already under immense pressure. In\nAugust 2017, a Care Quality Commission report found that the Trust had only\npartially met the requirements of a Warning Notice issued in 2016. For a\nhospital to be recently under a warning notice, the last thing it needs is\nincreased pressure.\nloss of acute services at St Helier Hospital would\ninevitably lead to increased pressure on St George’s as the hospital is far\neasier to access for the majority of my constituents, so many of whom have told\nme throughout this engagement process that they would access St George’s acute\nservices if St Helier’s were to move to Epsom or Belmont. But it is St George’s\nHospital that already relies on St Helier\nas the safety valve. A Morden based GP surgery recently clarified to me that\nall 14 day referrals are currently being sent to St Helier over St George’s. In\naddition, the maternity unit at St George’s Hospital had to temporarily close\nin both 2014 and 2015, directing women already in labour to St Helier.\nI am concerned that the Trust has not considered the knock on\neffect that the loss of acute services at one hospital would have on others.\nFor my constituents living in Pollards Hill or Longthornton, they are most\nlikely to look Croydon University Hospital if they lost their acute services at\nSt Helier. I understand, however, that you haven’t even approached either the\nLeader of Croydon Council or the Chair of their Health and Wellbeing Board to\nhear their views on your proposals.\nThe loss of acute services at one hospital will directly\nimpact the acute services at others. The assumption that all residents who use\nSt Helier’s acute services would continue to use them in Epsom or Belmont is\nabsolutely wrong. A loss of acute services at St Helier could prove to be the\nbreaking point for St George’s Hospital and an overwhelming burden for Croydon\nUniversity Hospital.\nDeprivation\nThe neighbourhoods within a mile of St Helier Hospital are\nconsiderably more deprived than those surrounding Epsom or Belmont with 26% of\nthe neighbourhoods within a mile of St Helier considered in the 30% most\ndeprived in the country, compared to just 4% of the neighbourhoods around\nBelmont and none of the neighbourhoods surrounding Epsom.\nSimilarly, Rose Hill is far more income deprived. Half of the\nneighbourhoods within a mile of St Helier’s current site are considered in the\n40% most deprived neighbourhoods for income, compared to just 13% of Belmont’s\nneighbourhoods and none of Epsom’s.\nRose Hill also has a considerably lower standard of\neducation, skills and training. Moving St Helier Hospital’s acute services to\nEpsom or Belmont would be moving them from a considerably more deprived area to\na considerably less deprived area.\nThe\ndeprivation of the local area to St Helier Hospital should be of significant\nimportance to you. The National Health Service Act 2006, as amended by the\nHealth and Social Care Act 2012, placed a duty on the NHS, Secretary of State,\nand CCGs to reduce health inequalities between patients in access to, and\noutcomes from, health care services.\nAny proposal\nto move acute services away from an area of multiple deprivation, such as the\narea immediately surrounding St Helier Hospital, would have to be justified on\nhealth equality grounds. This is outlined clearly in Section 14T of the Health\nand Social Care Act 2012.\nIt is\nimperative that you also take into account how\nservices are accessed. It is statistically proven that those living in a more\ndeprived area with poorer health are more likely to access A&E instead of\nlocal GP services. It is no wonder therefore that the most deprived areas in\n2014 had 4.9 fewer GPs and nurses per 100,000 residents than the least deprived\nareas.\nAs such,\neven considering moving acute services away from the statistically far more\ndeprived area of Rose Hill to the far less deprived areas of either Epsom or\nBelmont would completely go against your responsibility to ensure health\nequality. You would be moving acute services from an area that, due to its\ndeprivation, is more reliant on them. You have a duty to ensure health equality\nacross the entirety of the Trust’s catchment.\nClosure of\nthe Wilson\nEarlier this year, the Wilson Walk-In Centre closed its\ndoors. This was the only direct access NHS facility in East Merton and its\nclosure has led to a vast increase in those attending A&E at both St Helier\nand St George’s Hospitals. In fact, according to a Morden based GP, St Helier’s\nA&E attendances have increased by 20% since the Wilson closed.\nThe replacement for the Wilson Walk-In Centre is the NHS\nnon-emergency number, 111. This has made it harder for those in East Merton who\nhave poor employment security or poor English to access out of hours services.\nTo make matters worse, a staff member at the Wilson told me during this\nengagement process that 4-5 people a day still arrive looking for the walk-in.\nIf it is an emergency, the staff advise them to go to St Helier Hospital.\nThe loss of local health services has already left my\nconstituents reliant on St Helier Hospital’s acute services. We simply cannot\nafford to lose the services from the acute facilities that we have been forced\nto rely on.\nThe Process\nEpsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust does not\nhave the authority to decide the changes that should be made to its services.\nThis role is played by NHS Commissioners and local authorities including each\nimpacted Council’s Health and Wellbeing Board. Though the process itself is not\nillegal, you do not have the authority to make the changes you are proposing\nand so I consider it to be a hugely unjustifiable spend of public money and a\nmisleading of the general public, particularly at a time of austerity.\nI am appalled that you have openly acknowledged to key\nstakeholders that your preferred outcome for the engagement is for the acute\nservices to move to Belmont. What is the point of an engagement process if\nthose organising it are approaching it with such bias?\nOf course, this is a process that has been run so many times\nbefore to a huge expense of an estimated £40-50 million to the taxpayer. From\n‘Better Healthcare, Closer to Home’ to ‘Better Services, Better Value’, consultation\nafter consultation has shown that Rose Hill is the best site for St Helier.\nNothing has changed.\nWhat’s more, there is no indication in the Government budget\nthat any funds are available for the building of a new hospital. As such,\nspending money on an engagement or consultation is a complete misuse of public\nfunds.\nI am also extremely concerned at the long term impact on a\nhospital that loses acute services. Historically, this has happened to other\nhospitals, including in London. These examples could not be clearer: once a\nhospital loses acute services, it is the beginning of the end for that\nhospital.\nIn addition, I am particularly concerned at the lack of\ncriteria to measure the public’s response to this engagement. The questions you\nhave included on your public engagement materials are written in such a way to\nbe able to determine any reply they receive as a positive one. If the question\nat this stage is whether everybody in South London would want investment in\ntheir hospitals then of course the answer is yes. We don’t need a £37,000+\nengagement to decipher that. But that is not the question at stake here. The\nquestion is whether this investment should come at the expense of at least one\nof St Helier Hospital or Epsom Hospital’s acute services. The statistics\noutlined in my letter could not be clearer as to the devastating impact that\nthis would have on St Helier Hospital and my constituents who rely on it.\nThis is an engagement being run whilst Parliament is in\nrecess and over the school summer holidays, minimising the opportunity for\nparents and politicians to contribute to the process. I would be very grateful\nif you could inform me as to how you will measure the response to the\nengagement as I have been overwhelmed by the number of my constituents who have\nconfirmed that they are completely opposed to St Helier being at risk of losing\nany services and wanting to ensure that this concern is heard and counted loud\nand clear.\nI wholeheartedly support any investment in St Helier Hospital\nif and only if there is no threat to their acute services.\nPlease register this letter as my official response to the\nengagement process.\nYours Sincerely,\nSiobhain McDonagh MP",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_mitcham-morden_monthly-newsletter_february2013_aspx/content_105.html": "February 2013 Home / Mitcham and Morden / Newsletters / February 2013 Dear Friend, Hello and welcome again to my latest community newsletter. As I’m writing this, there has been a massive twist in the St Helier saga, so I’m going to leap straight in to give you the latest news, but later in the email I also have details about a number of events that might be of interest to you – and a bit of good news about your Council Tax. So here goes... St Helier – more twists and turns ahead At the time of writing, it looks as though the decision to close services at St Helier Hospital has been postponed – yet again... A decision was due to be announced today, but officials have put off the decision following mounting pressure from residents and local Councils, including Merton. However, before anyone gets carried away, the threat to St Helier remains very real. Last year, it was announced St Helier would lose its A&E, maternity, ICU, children’s unit, renal units and 390 in-patient beds, and our local NHS still needs to save £370m a year and sort out the financial difficulties at Epsom Hospital. Officially, two out of the area’s five A&Es will have to shut, and it’s reported a panel had decided one of the losers would be St Helier. Leaked documents show St Helier would only survive in the unlikely case that Croydon Hospital’s A&E is shut instead. Sadly, the Government’s position on the NHS couldn’t be clearer. Earlier this week, 4 hospitals in North London were all told they would lose their A&E. All this means that the Save St Helier campaign is more important than ever. If you haven’t already done so, please write to your GP and ask them what they are doing to stop the closure. GPs now have a big say over what happens in the NHS, and they are our best chance of stopping these closures. It’s being reported that one reason for the NHS postponing its decision to shut down St Helier is that GPs don’t agree. So why not send them an email, asking what they are doing to stop St Helier losing its A&E and maternity units? You can get your GP’s email address here, and it would be great if you could send a copy of your reply to me! If you are looking for other ways to help the campaign, click here. Finally, it seems like a long time ago, but last week I held a meeting at the House of Commons, and it was standing room only, as this picture shows: http://twitter.yfrog.com/gyw8nronj This is obviously the biggest issue in the area at the moment, and I’d like to thank you for your support. We have an uphill struggle if we are going to win, but every A&E in South West London is already overcrowded and seeing more people year after year – and every maternity unit is delivering more babies. If St Helier closes these services, where will everyone go? Support Morden Little League Morden Little League is the oldest and biggest Little League in the country, and offers an opportunity to play football to hundreds of boys and girls. I’m very proud of it, and of all the volunteers who keep it going. I just thought I’d let you know about a fundraising event they are organising in a few weeks time. Their Charity Poker Night will take place on Thursday 4th April from 7pm to midnight at North Cheam Social Club (Goals in Sutton), London Road, North Cheam. If you are interested, it is only £10 to enter. I’m not a cards player myself, but I’m told the game will be “No Limit Texas Holdem”, with a 50% Prize fund going to Morden Little League. Each player will receive 1500 chips at the start of play and it’s expected that the top 8 players on the final table will all get a payout. If you like cards, I’m sure that all means more to you than it does to me! To find out more or book your place please contact Andy Butcher at Andybutcher64@yahoo.co.uk or 07853 990963. Have your say on police cuts I thought I’d better remind you about a meeting in Morden next week about the police service. Boris Johnson’s Deputy Mayor, Stephen Greenhalgh, will be answering questions about police numbers, station closures, and the police budget, so if you have any questions please do get along. The meeting is at the Civic Centre in Morden on 26 February, starting at 6pm (doors open at 5.30pm). The Met Police’s Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne will also be there, as will the Leader of Merton Council Leader, Cllr Stephen Alambritis. Stephen has said the Council will oppose any moves to run down local police stations or reduce the size of Safer Neighbourhood Teams in the borough. So it should be an interesting meeting, and it will be well worth popping along to have your say too! Unfortunately, the meeting only lasts one hour and my colleague, Fiona Twycross, a Greater London Assembly Member, Fiona Twycross has complained that’s not long enough. Boris Johnson’s office propose to end the 24 hour service at Mitcham police station, Merton’s police admit the 1 Sergeant, 2 PCs, 3 PCSOs Safer Neighbourhood Teams will be abandoned, and we could lose local police offices in Lavender Fields, Mitcham town centre, and Pollards Hill. So please try to attend. The more people who are there to tell the Mayor how important it is not to cut police, the better! Something for the green-fingered Every week, I meet many local people and groups who do terrific things throughout Mitcham and Morden, and I try and advertise them if I can. If you enjoy gardening and flowers, here’s one group you might like to know about. The Merton Abbey Horticultural Society meets in Colliers Wood, and holds regular flower shows, lectures and social events, as well as floral art, handicraft and cookery classes, and they are currently looking for new members. To find out more, please contact Len Taylor, the Chair, or Barbara Silvester, the President at barbaralen@hotmail.co.uk or phone 020 3609 1676. If you’ve got green fingers, this is the club for you! Council Tax – another freeze on the way In case you’ve not seen the news, for the 3rd year running Labour councillors are freezing the Council Tax here in Merton. That means you will pay no more in 2013 than you did in 2010. It’s the first time ever that Council Tax has been frozen for three consecutive years. It’s quite an achievement, because you only have to open the papers to see that times are very tough for Councils, and because the Government are reducing funds for Councils by around 30% Merton is having to make cuts totalling £70m. But Labour Councillors know how hard it is for everyone at the moment. From 2006 to 2010, when the Conservatives ran Merton Council, typical bills went up by nearly £100 per annum for a Band ‘D’ property. It’s a difficult balance, because the Council still has to collect the rubbish, sweep the streets, run schools, and provide care for the elderly, but it’s their top priority not to put up your Council Tax. According to reports, two of our neighbouring Councils, Conservative-run Croydon and Lib Dem Kingston are set to increase their Council Tax this year. Elsewhere in South London, Conservative Bromley are also planning a tax rise, as is Conservative Surrey County Council. What’s more, Merton is one of only a handful of Councils in the country not to put up Council Tax for people on low incomes, after the Government cut funding for rebates by 10% and told Councils to consult about raising taxes. The decision means low income households will be hundreds of pounds worse off every year, and would have affected more than 14,000 households in Merton. However, Labour Councillors’ top priority is to keep Council Tax low, so if your circumstances are the same as last year you won’t have to pay any more. Community fun day in Pollards Hill It’s not often you get the chance to have a free day out and give your finances a spring clean, so I thought you might be interested in a local event this weekend, from 10am to 4pm on Saturday 23 February at the New Horizon Centre, South Lodge Avenue, Mitcham CR4 1LW. The event is being organised by Moat, and not only is it your chance to take part in activities for the whole family, there will also be lots of advisors on hand to help you find work, improve your education, make your finances stretch further and answer any concerns you might have about the changes to benefits that are going to hit thousands of local families from April. There will be refreshments throughout the day, plus goodie bags and even a free crèche. Among the attractions will be: • The Police Safer Neighbourhood Team • Rent and benefit advice from Moat’s Financial Inclusion Team • Meet your local community group – Commonside Community Development Trust • Citizens Advice Bureau • Health and well-being advice from Livewell and others • Help on getting back to work, and education advice from Croydon College • Pollards Hill Youth Group • And much more, including local Councillors and me! The whole event is completely free. So this is a great opportunity to get direct, free advice from experts who often have waiting lists for their services. I will be there too, so come and join me if you want my advice about anything at all – or even if you just want to say hello! To find out more, or to book your place at the crèche, please call Laura on 0845 359 6885. It should be a really popular day, and I hope to see you there! Anyway, I hope you’ve found this email helpful. In the time it took me to write it, there have probably been even more developments at St Helier Hospital, so watch this space! And as always, if you have any ideas for a future newsletter, please do get in touch. My best wishes, Siobhain",

There’s even an update on your Council Tax too, along with a bit of news about toilets – this email is nothing if it’s not an unusual mix! Council Tax – the freeze that might warm you up... When I wrote last month, Merton’s Councillors were about to vote on whether or not to freeze your Council Tax. Well, I’m pleased to say that they did. Your Council Tax will not be going up! As I’ve said before, these are hard times, and as we saw in the Budget last week, cuts are being made. Council services are not exempt from those cuts. But Merton Council is the only Council in South London that has frozen its Council Tax AND maintained the same level of Council Tax rebates for households on low wages. The Big London Energy Switch If you think you might be paying too much for your gas or electricity, you might want to know that Merton Council is supporting a scheme to help residents get a better deal on their bills. The Big London Energy Switch works by gathering together people from across London who want to cheaper bills. Once enough people have registered their interest, there is an ‘energy auction’, and energy companies will be invited to offer their cheapest tariffs to everyone who has registered. Whoever offers the cheapest tariff gets to offer you a new contract. You will receive a personal offer and once you have seen how much money you can save you will be able to decide whether to accept the offer or not. Savings will depend on how much energy you use and the price of your current tariff. There is no guarantee you will save money (if you’ve recently switched you may be on the best value tariff already). But there is no obligation on you to accept the offer and a similar recent scheme has seen yearly savings of between £60 and £200 per household, so there is nothing to lose by registering. You can register directly here. And hurry – you have to register by 8 April if you want to take advantage! Free Replacement Boilers In a similar vein, a few weeks ago I got an email from a reader who has been installing boilers for 20 years. He mentioned that some of his work comes through grants from the Government or local Council and told me about a scheme that I thought might be of interest to you. It’s called the “Affordable Warmth” scheme, which is also known as ECO (the energy companies obligation). The idea is that energy companies need to cut carbon emissions and there is £300 million from them to install new condensing boilers for free for older people and people on low wages. So if you are in receipt of Pension credit or Child tax credit (and your income is less than £15,860) why not find out more. You can get further details here. The same scheme might also help you get free loft or cavity insulation. If you want to talk to someone about the process of applying over the phone you can call local firm Glowarm on 020 8685 9498 and ask to speak to the ECO Grant department. You can also ring the Energy Saving Advice Service on 0300 123 1234. Free Money Advice event I appreciate this is short notice, but I thought you might be interested in an event taking place later today (Wednesday 27 March). If you or someone you know are worried about debt, looking for a job or training, or are unsure about the changes to benefits, why not pop along for free advice and information at Melrose School, Church Road, Mitcham, CR4 3BE. It all starts at 6pm, and the evening is being sponsored by Merton Priory Homes and Commonside Community Development Trust, who will also be there to provide advice on benefits and training. All sorts of groups will come together in one place to give you all the advice you need about dealing with debt, getting a new job, borrowing money at far better rates of interest and reducing your heating bills. The groups coming along include: Citizens Advice Bureau Christians Against Poverty Merton Credit Union Merton Priory Homes Their advice is completely free and trustworthy – so what have you got to lose by coming along? Everyone is welcome, so please mention it to your friends and neighbours. Oh, and don’t leave the kids behind. There will be lots for them to do! They will have a nice evening while you get things done. Spending a Penny So far this month, I’ve been mainly concentrating on finding ways to save you pennies, but one of the issues I get asked about most involves spending a penny. After the closure of McDonalds in Mitcham Town Centre, I’ve been sent a petition asking for a public toilet. Well, apparently, as I learned at a recent Figges Marsh community policing meeting, there’s an answer to the question about where you can go if you want to go.... Thanks to the involvement of Merton Council, you can pop in to the White Lion of Mortimer or the King’s Arms if you need to go to the loo – and you don’t need to buy a drink, it’s completely free of charge, not even a penny. New Vicar at St Mark’s Finally, on a totally different subject, congratulations to Nigel Stone, who was introduced as the new Vicar of St Mark’s Church in Mitcham just a week ago. It’s a great church, and ours is a great community, so I’m sure he’ll fit in really well here. Good luck Nigel! Anyway, I hope that this is all of interest to you. Hopefully there’ll have been something in this month’s newsletter to help you save some money, and maybe that will make you feel a little warmer. If not, I’ll be in touch next month, when there’s bound to be a heatwave... If you can think of any items you’d like me to put in a future newsletter, please let me know – and I’ll be in touch in a month’s time! My best wishes, Siobhain",

Most of the children who died were under the age of 1 and died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Many of the children died because they did not have access to a cot during their stay.\nIt is shocking that in the 5th largest economy in the world, children are dying due to a lack of access to a cot.

However, the company has proposed several changes to employee terms and conditions that will see thousands of long-serving workers lose out.\nThe changes include:\n- Cutting Sunday premium\n- Cutting Bank Holiday premium\n- Limiting 'unsocial' hours\n- Scrapping the existing pension scheme\nSiobhain\ncalled on the Prime Minister this month to do all he can to ensure that companies not abiding by the spirit of the new National Living Wage were stopped from making such pay cuts - however, the government has not committed its support to doing so.\nWe know that 2,700 employees will be losing out at least £1000 per year as a result of M&S's proposals, and at least 700 will lose out at least £2000 per year.\nFurthermore, staff who choose not to sign the new terms and conditions have been threatened with dismissal.\n***DO YOU STAND TO LOSE OUT? EMAIL mcdonaghs@parliament.uk\nSTAFF MEMBERS HAVE GOT IN TOUCH WITH SIOBHAIN ANONYMOUSLY TO HIGHLIGHT THE EXTENT OF THEIR PAY CUTS - READ WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY BELOW\nM&S Yammer (social media) site\n‘We’ve just been hit by a triple whammy of premium payments and pension changes - and worst of all my job as a coach has been abolished. Never felt as undervalued in my job as I do today’\n‘It all works out that for a coach it’s a 39p pay rise - that’s 4%, PLUS we have to pay a minimum of 3% in pension contributions– given that I’ve not even got a cost of living pay rise and losing Sunday and bank holiday pay as well – this is not good news – 22 years’ service’ ‘I will need to consider moving my wife and children to a smaller house, extending the length and term of my mortgage and taking on another part time job to compensate’\n‘Fact – I cannot earn next year what I earned last year - even with the one off payment’\n‘Sleepless nights and anguish that this has created throughout the company’s long term employees is nothing short of disgraceful’\n‘I work every other Sunday and I’ve worked in the business for 17 years – I will be losing double pay, location premium and I’m getting a 40p pay increase – and advisers are getting £1.90 pay rise – section managers 69p – am I missing the point here? It seems that being a loyal hard working long serving member of staff has absolutely no benefit and I feel very let down’\n‘\nFRANK’\n‘I am a section manager at Marks and Spencer … Due to the fact that my team works night shifts many of us will be hit by a double whammy of losing Sunday premium payments together with a reduction in the amount we earn for working unsocial hours overnight. I have members of my team who will be out of pocket to the tune of between £400 and £500 per month if the proposed changes go ahead.\nThis is also being combined with the proposed withdrawal of our non-contributory pension scheme, meaning that as we are potentially taking such a big hit on salary we would be unable to put money towards our retirement from this point on.\nWhilst the implementation of the chancellors policy would undoubtedly result in many staff receiving a welcome boost to pay, it would also have an absolutely devastating impact to others.’\n‘\nWENDY’\n‘Thank you for the question you asked at today’s PMQs Siobhain, it was nice to see that there is someone out there looking out for us.\nI am in my 60s and have worked for M&S for almost 20 years now, and this is the first time in all of my years of employment that I have been offered a pay rise that will mean I take home less money, and will have a worse pension.\nFrom the publicity that has been issued from M&S … it comes over that the company is looking after its employees and is a good employer. Nowhere does state that the lowest paid employees in most cases will be paying for the new hourly rate by the loss of the benefits that have been accumulated over years.\nSo not only will I have to work for another half decade longer than I expected to obtain my old age pension, and lose money if I take my company pension earlier than at the age of 66, I will also be earning less each year., just over £10k gross per year for a part-time week, and we are now forced to work 3 bank holidays each year as well as boxing day if due on shift. Very different terms to the first contract I signed.\n‘\nMARY’\n‘I am a long serving member of M&S, almost 30 years in fact, along with many of my colleagues we have been sent a proposal of changes … These proposals will have a devastating effect on how people will pay their everyday living, with some people in tears worrying about their rent, mortgages, being able to pay their travel. I am saddened that the business feels this proposal is the way forward.\n‘\nSARAH’\n‘I am an affected employer. I am a single woman and I live alone.\nI don't earn a huge amount by any means: but if this proposal goes through, I stand to lose nearly £2,000 over the course of a year. My crime is to be a loyal member of staff for over a decade and a half. Morale is very low, and it a small comfort that a least it has now been put in a more public eye’.\n‘\nEWAN’\n‘I am one of the thousands of employees affected by these changes that are being proposed to start in April 2017. Long serving, loyal staff that have worked for the company through good and bad times are being affected… Staff that currently receive double time or time and a half on Sunday's will no longer receive this payment Sunday working will be at single time. Bank Holiday pay is also being reduced from double time to time and a half. Working unsocial hours is also being reduced. The company is reducing loyal, long serving employees pay to pay for the New living wage. All customer assistants will receive £8.50 per hour from 1st April 2017 I fully support this but not at the expense of losing my pay and premium.\nI have worked for the company for 17 years I will be losing £1700 a year (gross) some colleagues that work every other Sunday will loss around £3400 (gross) a year and if someone is unfortunate enough that their partner works at M&S this could be up to £6800 per year.\nThe 11000 staff are having a pay cut to pay for a high rate of pay for customer assistants to meet with the change in the living wage and to be competitive by 2020 when the living wage is at £9.00 per hour… I thank you for bringing this extremely concerning and difficult time for M&S employees and other retail employees to the forefront. Business must not be able to fund this new living wage by reducing other workers pay. As you are aware Marks and Spencer does not recognise a union and have refused to talk to a union concerning their proposals.’\n‘ROXANNA’\n‘I have been with the company since the 1980s. As you may know marks and spencer have proposed a new pay package which will result in my wage decreasing by around £170 a month. It will also have a negative effect on my pension. I need to continue to work weekends because of difficult personal circumstances. For this reason I cannot work extra shifts during the week as this is when I need to be at home with my son who is sick. Losing this amount of money a month could prove extremely problematic for me and my family. I cannot do extra shifts and if my pay is decreased I do not know what I will be able to do to support my family. This proposed package only effects 11% of the staff, surely this change can be stopped as its effects will not be that detrimental to the company.’\n‘BARBARA’\n‘I've worked for them for decades and my partner has worked for them even longer. My position is going to be abolished, and the unsocial hours, and the Sunday and bank holiday premiums all affect us. Me and my partner are worried that we won’t be able to pay our mortgage – and it’s so devastating to go from being in secure employment to this uncertainty. Apparently to Marks and Spencer our loyalty and experience mean nothing anymore,it's just so disheartening really.’\n‘MAGDA’\n‘I have worked for M&S for fifteen years so I qualify for the changes to Sunday payments. We feel that the company is trying to fund the up and coming living wage pay rise by taking our Premium Sunday and Bank holiday payments away from us. We have been loyal, hard working staff and we feel let down and upset by what they are trying to do, so by you saying what you did in the House of Commons yesterday meant a great deal to all of us. So a big Thank You!! It is good to know that someone in Parliament is aware of what is going on because obviously Cameron hasn't got a clue.’\n‘BECKY’\n‘As a loyal M&S employee with well over a decade’s experience, I would like to commend and thank you for your words of support in parliament this week! These proposed changes will affect me, not only the loss of premiums but the closing of their final salary pension scheme, and the fact they are no longer going to acknowledge my induction coach role. I have interviewed and trained many new employees, and will now be getting paid just the same as them. These proposals are a kick in the teeth to many loyal long service employees. All on the back of the new living wage. To see and hear you in action has brought a little bit of comfort to a lot of colleagues! …There is a consultation period, but I fear these changes will go ahead.’\n'CONNOR'\n‘I have worked for M&S for 20 years, mainly on nights. Obviously i have enjoyed those years … getting satisfaction from delivering our goals and feeling like I was contributing greatly to achieving our targets. NO MORE...\nAs you are aware M&S are proposing to cut my night premium, cut Sunday premium and bank holiday totalling several thousand pounds worth of SHORTFALL in my wages per annum!! On top of that, they in their wisdom, suggest i agree to this and also start to contribute into a pension. Where and how am i going to be able to do that?\nI am sick but have a wonderful, large family to support, as well as a mortgage. I stand to lose everything… nothing to fall back on, having given my best years to M&S\nI feel cheated and betrayed.’",

Even the Government's own documents highlight the potential damage to our country from a no deal Brexit.

This is not project fear, but the practical, real possible consequences of a no deal and I will continue to wholeheartedly oppose it.\nBut Parliament is in deadlock and there needs to be a mechanism to break the impasse. That’s why I believe in a People’s Vote. We gave the responsibility for deciding on whether we should leave the EU to the people of this country, and now we have seen the terms of a Brexit deal brought back by the previous Prime Minister and the potential under the new Prime Minister of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit, I believe those same people deserve the opportunity to have their say.\nLooking back to 2016, I know so much more about the impact of leaving the European Union than I did then.\nI suspect that is true for all of us. I have been amazed by the politicians and commentators who suggest that our economy taking a hit would be a price worth paying.

So, Siobhain got the rare opportunity of being able to question the Chancellor, leaving him no chance of escape.\nSiobhain took him to task on his appalling record in Government. Under his watch, taxes have risen to their highest level since WW2, and living standards have fallen by 3%. It is the first Parliament EVER where households have been poorer at the end than at its’ start.\nYou can watch a clip of the grilling here: https://twitter.com/Siobhain_Mc/status/1729925334324146662",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_crossrail-2-tooting-broadway_aspx/content_71.html": "Crossrail 2 will be in operation from around 2030, and is planned to better connect London and the South East, via central London.\nInitially, Transport for London (TfL) had proposed a Crossrail 2 station at Tooting Broadway, between Wimbledon and Clapham Junction. However, TfL have subsequently proposed that the station be located at Balham (instead of Tooting Broadway) because of costs arising from ‘ground conditions’.\nIt seems that building a station at Tooting Broadway is being pushed out – but it’s still a viable option, and TfL needs to understand how detrimental it would be for our community to miss out on the chance of having better transport links further down the Northern Line.\nWe believe that a station at Tooting Broadway, between Wimbledon and Clapham Junction, would be best for the residents of Mitcham and Morden, and we are against TfL moving the proposed station to Balham.\nThat's why myself and a group of Colliers Wood councillors have launched a petition in favour of a Tooting Broadway Crossrail 2 station.\nAn interchange at Tooting Broadway would directly benefit our area in so many ways.\nEasing congestion on the Northern Line\nHaving a Crossrail 2 station further down the Northern Line at Tooting Broadway, rather than Balham, would relieve the huge overcrowding for commuters on the Northern Line that is worst between Tooting Bec and Stockwell.\nThis ‘Clapham Squeeze’ (which sees this stretch of line practically unusable between 8-9am each weekday morning) would be hugely eased by giving commuters an additional choice of travelling on Crossrail 2 to Victoria, Euston or a number of other central destinations, from Tooting Broadway.\nBalham is already a very well connected station. Via Southern Railway, commuters can get to London Victoria directly from Balham, as well as to the rest of South London.\nHowever, no Northern Line stations from Balham to the end of the line at Morden have direct rail connection. Therefore, a Crossrail 2 station at Tooting Broadway would transform the transport links at this end of the line.\nMitcham & Morden and ‘Regeneration’\nA Crossrail 2 station at Tooting Broadway would transform the infrastructure of our area. For instance, Colliers Wood in particular is an area of ‘intensification’, and is being targeted by the Mayor’s Regeneration Fund.\nWhile the Mayor’s remit focuses on improving the flow of traffic, cycle lanes, and reducing the congestion caused by buses, a tube station close by at Tooting Broadway would much be much better, and closer, for our local community than one at Balham.\nBy improving access to Tooting Broadway, a new station would be attracting investment not just to Tooting town centre and its connecting roads, but the surrounding areas in Mitcham and Morden too, which would be more easily accessible for commuters.\nMeanwhile, Balham town centre has already seen significant investment and regeneration on its high street.\nSuch opportunities for investment should be better spread across this area of South West London.\nBetter connections from Mitcham & Morden\nHaving the station at Tooting Broadway would also mean that residents will be able to get to Clapham Junction in just four mins and Euston/Kings Cross St Pancras in twenty minutes. This would serve to attract business investment into the more southern section of the Northern Line\nIt would also improve the employment prospects of constituents in Mitcham and Morden, who will be able to travel further afield for work.\nThis is because transport links from Mitcham, Morden and Colliers Wood, to Tooting Broadway are much better than to Balham. Currently, there is only one bus that connects Balham to Mitcham, but there are five buses that connect Tooting Broadway to Mitcham.\nThis means a much-needed radical transformation for the areas of our constituency that are not served by a tube line.\nGetting involved\nThere are three main ways that you can get involved.\nFirstly, you can\ndownload the petition attached and get your neighbours to sign it and send it back (by the end of December) to Siobhain at: 1 Crown Rd, Morden, SM4 5DD. The petition reads\n‘We the\nundersigned residents of Mitcham & Morden strongly object to the CrossRail2 station being sited at Balham. It is imperative that this station is at Tooting Broadway to improve transport infrastructure for the residents of Mitcham & Morden.’\nSecondly, you can\nattend a TfL consultation in your area and express your concerns. The TfL consultations that are taking place are as follows:\nWednesday 25 November 2015 12pm – 8pm - Outside 6 Selkirk Road, SW17 0ES\nThursday 26 November 2015 12pm – 8pm - Outside 6 Selkirk Road, SW17 0ES\nFriday 27 November 2015 12pm – 8pm - Outside 3 Balham Grove, SW12 8AY\nSaturday 28 November 2015 11am – 4pm - Outside 3 Balham Grove, SW12 8AY\nWednesday 2 December 2015 12pm – 8pm - Wimbledon Piazza, SW19 1QB\nThursday 3 December 2015 12pm – 8pm - Wimbledon Piazza, SW19 1QB\nSaturday 12 December 2015 11am – 4pm - Outside 7 – 9 Bellevue Road, SW17 7EG\nMonday 14 December 2015 12pm – 8pm - Central London Golf Centre, Burntwood Lane, SW17 0AT\nThirdly, you can\nsubmit an online consultation to express your views. This is accessible on the Crossrail 2 website: https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/crossrail2/october2015/consultation\nThe TfL consultation was opened in October 2015, and\nwill close on Friday 8 January 2016.\nThis leaves a short window of opportunity to express your preference for Tooting Broadway – so please take this opportunity to make your voice heard.\nMap screenshot taken from: http://crossrail2.co.uk/the-route/",

That includes people living in Mitcham and Morden.\nThe answer to rising food prices, fuel costs, and rising rent and mortgage prices? Another £12.50 per day to drive your car to work!\nBy no means am I opposed to clean air reform, I do believe that collectively our behaviours and attitudes towards the crisis must change, however, the solution is not to further tax working people just to drive their car. It should be the people with the broadest shoulders that should pay for it.\nThose polluting the most, ironically, are those who can also most afford to contribute to the recovery of our planet. The proposed expansion zone for the ULEZ covers a span of areas with far less efficient public transport than central London. Areas where people are more likely to rely on a car. Those are not the people who should be penalised.\nAction I Have Taken Against the ULEZ Expansion:\nIn a recent interview with LBC, I explained my opposition to the mayor’s scheme. I also appeared on Newsnight to express the concerns of over 215,000 people who have signed a petition to stop the expansion of the ULEZ.\nYou can watch me on Newsnight here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001j82x/newsnight-rescued-from-the-rubble-in-syria\nI know Sadiq Khan is in politics to help people which is why at every available opportunity I will urge him, not to ignore the climate crisis and air pollution, but delay so that we might find a solution that doesn’t pile pressure upon pressure on those least able to bear it.\nThis will also hit small businesses. I was recently contacted by Mr H who feared that his garage will not be able to survive in the hostile landscape the expanded ULEZ would bring about.\nI will continue to stand firm in my opposition to the expansion of the ULEZ boundary. People earning less than £12.50 an hour cannot afford to pay £12.50 a day to go to work or to see their families.",

As always, over the last month I’ve met many people across this fantastic community who have shown such dedication to helping others, and this month’s newsletter focuses on just a few of them, from the community groups who are helping people sort out their finances, to the Brownies, and from a local roofer who has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity to the Leader of our local Council, who has just won a top accolade for his hard work. There’s also a quick update on all that’s going on at St Helier, and at one of our most improved local schools. I hope there’s something here of interest to you, but I hope you won’t mind if I start with a tribute to someone from our community who made a big difference in a short space of time. RIP Councillor Gam Gurung I am very sorry to say that last week our community lost one of its most courageous and dedicated community leaders. Gam Gurung was just 53 years old, but he packed so much into his short time with us. Born in Nepal, Gam joined the British Army’s legendary Gurkhas, where he served more than 16 years, becoming a Sergeant. Even when he left the forces, he still wanted to give something back, and became a teacher at Carshalton College, passing on his building and bricklaying skills to young apprentices. He also became active in the British Nepalese community, and played a big role in the campaign made famous by Joanna Lumley to allow Gurkhas to become British citizens. After his success with that campaign, Gam decided to become a Councillor, and it wasn’t long before he became the first Gurkha ever to be a Labour Councillor. Always a trailblazer, Gam never forgot where he had come from, and fought constantly to improve the lives of people worse off than himself. In just three years, he helped many local residents, and was a loyal and dedicated supporter of our local community. There is one delightful story of how, when he was out canvassing, he noticed a brick wall that had fallen over, and seeing that the owner was elderly offered to rebuild it himself – which he duly did. Over the past few months, Gam fought cancer as courageously as he has tackled every other challenge throughout his life, and it has been a privilege to know him. My thoughts are with his friends, his wife and his young family. This is obviously a very difficult time for them, but Gam was a really great guy and will be remembered fondly for all his achievements. Thank you Brown Owl! On a lighter note, just over a week ago I was lucky enough to be invited to the 90th anniversary celebrations of the 6th Mitcham (St Barnabas) Brownies. It was lovely to meet everyone, and especially to say goodbye to Brown Owl, Linda Hamilton, who is retiring after 47 years of service – what a brilliant servant to the community she has been! If you know anyone who is interested in taking over from Linda and becoming the next Brown Owl, please do let me know. They’re a great little group, and I know you will enjoy it hugely – although you don’t have to promise to do it for quite as long as Linda. Money Matters These are very worrying times for many of us. Money is tight and it’s hard to know where to get help. So I’m pleased to let you know about a special fun day taking place in Mitcham at the beginning of this month, where you can also get advice or information on money management, training, housing or how the forthcoming benefit changes might affect you. The Advice and Information Day takes place from 10am to 1pm on Saturday, 6th July at Liberty School on Western Road, and there will be experts on hand from various organisations, including Merton Welfare and Benefits Service, Citizens Advice Bureau, Wandle Housing, Construction Skills Centre, Credit Union, Merton Adult Education, Jeremiah Project, Christians Against Poverty and Training and Apprenticeships Ltd. Just turn up on the day. There will also be a whole range of activities to keep the children occupied, including face painting, as well as free refreshments and a raffle. You will also be able to find out about sports clubs, community events and even about low cost holiday activities in the borough for your children. All in all, it should be a lot of fun, on top of being an excellent opportunity to get access to the best information available to get your finances in shape. Morden School fast improving It’s less than a year ago that Merton Council gave the green light for Bishopsford High School in Morden to become an Academy. However, in a very short time it’s clear they’ve come on by leaps and bounds. Ofsted recently conducted a review of the school, which has now been renamed Harris Academy Morden, and their report is fantastic! According to Ofsted, who aren’t always complimentary about schools, “students are making better and faster progress than ever before.” In fact, they describe the school’s determination to improve as “relentless”, and the school’s teaching as “improving rapidly”. Given that the school was in a parlous state just a year ago, I have to say this is one of the most improved school reports I’ve ever seen, so well done to all the students and staff for all your hard work – and good luck to everyone who is taking their exams! St Helier Hospital – yet another twist to the story... In case you haven’t seen the news, thanks largely to Merton Council we have just scored a small victory over plans to close services at St Helier Hospital. The threat to close its A&E, Maternity Unit and numerous other services and hospital beds still remains, but we have successfully forced the Government to delay the process yet again. They had wanted to consult the public about the closure plans over the summer holidays, but the Labour Leader of Merton Council, Stephen Alambritis, threatened to go to Judicial Review, and it is now going to be put off until later in the year, as you can read here. I’ve made a number of speeches and asked a series of questions about St Helier in the House of Commons over the past few weeks. Thank you to everyone for your continuing support for this campaign. It’s so important that we do all we can to Save St Helier. If the cuts go ahead, we will lose our intensive care unit, our neonatal unit, our children’s services, our renal unit and about half our 390 in-patient beds as well as our A&E and maternity unit. It’s clear that closing units at St Helier will not just be bad news for those of us who rely on it, will also bring our neighbouring hospitals to bursting point. An honourable man! At the Queen’s Birthday Honours, I’m very pleased to say that one of our top businesspeople was given an MBE for services to the community and local charities. Paul Strank, who runs Paul Strank Roofing Limited, is an amazing character, and I was delighted to see him at a fundraising event that he’d arranged for Children in Need just last week. Paul and his wife Irene have been tirelessly working in the community for more than 40 years – for example, they were the leading lights of an initiative I was involved in just a year ago to help young people get work experience, and they are a remarkable couple. You can read more about his achievement here. Volunteering with Christian Care I’ve also been contacted by Merton Christian Care. They’re another terrific local organisation, and do so much to support local people. There are several ways you can help as a volunteer. For instance, they are looking for people to lead trips for teenagers, like the theatre or ice skating. If you are a good listener, they are looking for people who can befriend people who are isolated or lonely due to old age, trouble getting round, or language difficulties. They are also on the lookout for people prepared to go shopping for people who struggle to get out. In fact there are lots of ways of helping, and you can find out more by visiting their website here. Congratulations to Merton Council Finally, some good news about our local Council. It’s not been an easy time for Councils over the past few years. Government funding has been cut by nearly a third, and Merton Council has had to find £70m of savings. But under the new Labour Leader of the Council, Councillor Stephen Alambritis, Merton Council has steadily improved, and last week it was announced that Merton is the top Council in the country. Stephen was praised for his strong political leadership and for making savings in a sustainable way in line with ! people’s priorities. Although Stephen is the first to admit life’s still far from perfect for many people, he’s certainly done an impressive job. For instance, Merton is the only Council in South London to freeze Council Tax for three consecutive years and maintain rebates for low income families. He has also kept all our libraries and children’s centres open, built dozens of new classrooms at fast-improving schools, and launched a new free bulky waste collection service. But he’s constantly looking to improve, so if you’ve got any suggestions for making the Council better, email Stephen at stephen@mmlp.org.uk – I know he’ll be pleased to hear your comments! Anyway, that’s enough for now. Mitcham and Morden is the best constituency in the country and I am so proud of this community, so if you have any suggestions for events or stories about other local people or groups to go in my next newsletter please email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. My best wishes,",

For 18 years, consultation after consultation has been run - at a cost of almost £50 million to the taxpayer - threatening the future of St Helier Hospital.\nWe've been here before.\nYou may remember the conference call overheard on a train by a BBC London Reporter in 2015 in which plans to close St Helier Hospital and build a new hospital in Sutton were revealed: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32297664.\nFast forward to 2017 where we heard proposals for all acute hospital services (including major A&E and consultant led maternity services) to be located at just one site: Epsom, St Helier or Belmont (Sutton). A public engagement was run, receiving over 6,000 responses calling for St Helier to remain fully operational on its current site. Unbelievably, these responses were acknowledged, but not been counted. This is even more concerning considering that Freedom of Information requests revealed a distribution of engagement materials across the entire catchment of the Trust, except for the area nearest to the current St Helier Hospital site.\nSo what's happening now?\nSt Helier Hospital's future is under serious threat once again. The NHS is running yet another public engagement with the same proposal: moving all acute hospital services to just one site: Epsom, St Helier or Belmont (Sutton). The latest brand name: \"Improving Healthcare Together 2020-2030\".\nHistory suggests that once a hospital loses acute services, it is the beginning of the end for that hospital.\nMoving acute services including major A&E and consultant led maternity services away from St Helier Hospital would literally be moving them away from an area that needs them more, completely going against the purpose of a hospital.\nAnd can you imagine the pressure that St George's Hospital and Croydon University Hospital would be put under if St Helier lost its major A&E?\nThe public consultation stage of these proposals is expected in Spring 2019. Please check back for updates.\nIf you have any questions about the future of St Helier Hospital please do not hesitate to contact me at mcdonaghs@parliament.uk or 0207 219 4678.",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_free-school-meals_aspx/content_21.html": "Many families reliant on free school meals already struggle to put food on the table. At a time of financial uncertainty for many, our most vulnerable families are not receiving the support they are entitled to.\nWith schools closed due to the coronavirus lockdown, a huge number of parents, teachers and schools have\ncontacted Siobhain to report difficulties with the Free School Meal system that is supposed to continue through a voucher scheme.\nWe have heard from schools who cannot access the system, from parents who do not have an email address, and from families without internet access. For example, across the country there are 127,370 children trapped in temporary accommodation who are often moved between accommodation and struggle to find a provider who will change homes as frequently as they do.\nWhat’s more, where it is in operation, the vouchers are only redeemable at specific stores, with Waitrose and Marks and Spencer eligible but stores including Lidl and the Co-op not. Would it not be in the interest of the families, the supermarkets and the taxpayer if all stores were part of the scheme and not just the most expensive?\nAnd so Siobhain has coordinated a letter signed by over 70 MPs of all political parties calling for urgent measures to rectify the problems facing this system. This letter was covered by a range of national press, including BBC News who highlighted the situation for a number of our local schools and families.\nYou can\nsee this piece here and\nSiobhain's letter in full here.\nIf your school is still having difficulties with the system, please do not hesitate to contact Siobhain directly at mcdonaghs@parliament.uk so that she can raise urgently on your behalf.\nThe campaign continues!",

I was born and have always lived in this area, and am so proud of the people who make it such a great place. It’s hard to look back on 2012 without mentioning the Olympics and Paralympics, which were such fantastic events. I was especially impressed by the efforts of Games Makers. I’ve met several who live in Mitcham and Morden, and you all did us proud! To mark the Games, I organised a special Olympics Celebration and Community Fayre at Tooting and Mitcham Football Club (click here for the video of the event). It was completely free, and an amazing 4,000 people attended. There was coaching for sports like athletics, football, cricket, rugby and basketball, as well as zumba. People had photos with the Olympic Torch, got Health MOTs and advice on blood pressure, weight and diet, and dozens of community groups offered their services too. It was a brilliant and inspiring day, and I’d like to thank all who that took part, as well as the many local volunteers who made it happen! Another massive community event I arranged was February’s Heating Advice Day at the Civic Centre in Morden. Each week, many people contact me about the high cost of heating and lighting their homes, so I organised a special event to help people reduce their bills, switch providers, and cut costs through insulation and energy efficiency. Dozens of businesses, charities and voluntary groups gave advice and handed out freebies, including every utility company, uSwitch, Age UK and Merton Council, as well as Consumer Focus, the consumer rights organisation. Over 500 people attended, and most were helped in some way. Again, I couldn’t have done it without the help of dozens of volunteers from our local community. Thank you so much! (click here for photos of the day). Once again, the biggest issue of the year has been the Save St Helier campaign. Together, we are fighting the threat to shut St Helier’s A&E, maternity, ICU, children’s and renal units, as well as 390 in-patient beds – all because our local NHS has to save £370m a year. We have a strong case, and we are making progress. Indeed, the plans are currently on hold. That’s because Surrey’s health bosses are worried that huge debts at Epsom Hospital might mean there is no A&E from Tooting to Guildford. We also have the backing of Councillors from Sutton and Merton. However, the plans are only on hold – they haven’t been rejected completely. I’m particularly worried because of what is going on in SE London, where some NHS Trusts are in financial trouble. There, Government sent in financial administrators who are saying the A&E in Lewisham must close, even though Lewisham is not one of the hospitals with big debts. I’m very worried something similar could happen to us. St Helier’s finances are relatively healthy, but could it suffer because Epsom’s finances aren’t? If you are looking for ways to help the campaign, read this. 2012 was the year of the omnishambles, with a range of unusual U-turns and bizarre taxes like the Pasty Tax and the Caravan Tax. During the summer, I even found myself suddenly running a campaign against a Skip Tax. It started when a local business came to tell me that the Government had stuck up the tax for disposing of building waste literally overnight, without any warning. People had hired skips at one price, but the skip hire companies could no longer afford to empty them. Thousands of skips, full of rubble, were lying on the streets, too expensive to empty, and hundreds of waste removal firms across the country were about to go bust. So for several weeks, I helped organise a group of skip firms trying to persuade the Government to back down. Common sense prevailed in the end (The Sun said the Government was In Deep Rubble!), but it was a terrible time for all those involved. Campaigning together as a community can make a big difference. For instance, in 2012 we’ve seen good progress on a couple of community campaigns. First, thank you to everyone who supported the campaign to get the police to tackle anti-social drinking in Mitcham. This has long been a concern locally, and thanks to your involvement we now have a new Controlled Drinking Zone. Click here for details. More than 600 local people responded to my survey asking if you supported the scheme, and all but a handful of people agreed. Particular thanks should go to Edith Macauley, the Cabinet Member for Community Safety, who pushed the policy through. It’s been a big year for Edith, who as well as being a Councillor is also a magistrate and was the first black woman to be Mayor of Merton – earlier this year she received an MBE from the Queen for services to our local community. Well done Edith! Secondly, 2012 has seen progress on improving the ugly black 17-storey Colliers Wood Tower. The horrible car park has been demolished, and work is now finally under way inside the Tower to build the flats that were first promised back in 2003. We will also get a small sum of money to make the area by the tube station look a bit nicer. It’s been a very long saga, and the owners have not treated the people of Colliers Wood well. However, thanks to the determination of local Councillors, we’re getting there. Most importantly, the owners will have to re-clad the whole building (see page 4 here for an impression of how it will look). Colliers Wood is already much better looking after Holiday Inn’s extension, and I hope it’s not long before we have a town centre to be proud of. Elsewhere, we’ve worked hard as a community throughout 2012 to tackle some of the issues that led to the riots of 2011. For instance, I’ve been helping Merton’s new Police Commander, Darren Williams, develop projects designed to give young people at risk of getting into trouble something better to do with their time. Together with The Hub at Tooting and Mitcham Football Club, we have obtained funding to run a new Boxing Club. Anyone watching the Olympics will have seen how sports like boxing can instill discipline at the same time as offering sporting challenge, and I know it will appeal to many of our young people who might have been tempted to get involved in a gang. Thank yous are due in particular to Darren and to Steve Adkins at The Hub. I’m blessed to be an MP for such a great area. There are too many wonderful people to list them all. But I’d like to praise all the community organisations and voluntary groups that work so hard delivering local services. These are tough times and budgets are more stretched than ever, but I see the difference your efforts make to my constituents, and I’m so grateful. I should mention one timely example of the fantastic work of local community groups, in case it is of interest to your service users. Christmas can be a difficult time for some, so Churches Together in Mitcham offer a full 3-course home cooked Christmas Dinner, as well as some fun and good company, for those who are alone on Christmas Day. This year’s festivities start at 11am on Christmas Day, with food from 1pm, at the Mitcham Parish Centre on Church Path. Anyone interested in going can book a place by contacting the organiser, Councillor Judy Saunders. Get in touch with her now to avoid disappointment! Finally, please excuse me mentioning politics, but I want to end on an optimistic note as that’s how 2012 ended thanks to the re-election of President Obama. We live in an interconnected world, and what happens in the US has a big impact here in the UK. It was really important he won, and I’m proud to say I took a group of over 30 friends and Labour Party members from Mitcham and Morden to Cuyahoga County in Cleveland, Ohio to volunteer for a week on the Obama Campaign (we all paid for the whole trip ourselves). It was the experience of a lifetime and we all learnt a lot that will help us back home. Despite some people’s prejudices about America, we actually saw at first hand what a great country it is. For most Americans, the American dream is about aspiration and community, or as President Obama put it in his brilliant victory speech \"The freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights. And among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism. That's what makes America great.\" These are values I see every day here in Mitcham and Morden, especially at this time of year. So, on that inspiring and uplifting note, Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! And as always, thank you again for all the help you give me. Siobhain",

If you want ideas for what to say, my briefing note includes a suggested letter on page 5. Click here to see it. When your GP replies, please send a copy to\nsavesthelier@mmlp.org.uk.\n2 Write to the Secretary of State for Health. Tell him what you think and why you want to keep St Helier open. I'm campaigning for a moratorium on all A&E closures, but it is up to Ministers to decide. You can write to the Health Secretary from this website:\nwww.dh.gov.uk/health/contact-dh or by letter to Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP, Secretary of State for Health, Richmond House, 79 Whitehall, London SW1A 2NS.\n3 Take copies of the Save St Helier petition, and tell your friends, family and neighbours about the plans. Ask them to sign the petition, write to their MP and do all the things you are doing to Save St Helier. You can also ask your local newsagent, hairdresser, etc if they will put a petition on display for their customers to sign too.\n4 Write to your local paper.

It's something I feel so strongly about I've raised it in Parliament, during Prime Minister’s Questions, and I want you to help me by signing a petition.\nIt’s really easy to do – I’ll show you how in a moment. But first, let me tell you what’s the problem.\nDid you know that the Government is putting a tax of around £1,000 on anyone who wants to be a police officer?\nThat’s right, as if the cost of living wasn’t bad enough already they’re bringing in a new Bobby Tax.\nFrom now on, anyone who wants to apply to become a police officer can forget it, unless they can cough up a grand to go on a new course they’ve invented called the Certificate in Knowledge of Policing.\nWithout paying the money, you won’t even be allowed to apply for the force, let alone have an interview or get the job.\nWhy are they doing this?\nIt’s almost like going back to the days when the Army sold a ‘commission’ – which meant their best jobs went to dodgy rich folk, like Flashman.\nThe Army stopped all that back in 1871, when they realised it was better to give the job to people based on merit rather than on how rich or posh they are.\nSo why are the Government introducing the Bobby Tax for the police in 2014?\nWhy should our best, most talented youngsters have to fork out £1,000 for the privilege of joining the police?\nIt doesn’t make any sense. Most of the young people from Mitcham and Morden won’t be able to afford that – so we’ll end up with police officers from wealthy backgrounds, who don’t know the first thing about what it’s like to live in a community like ours.\nLet’s be truthful. The police have a tough job.\nEveryone agrees we need to have a police force that is more like the community it polices. We need more people from tough backgrounds, more people from ethnic minorities. In short, we need more people from places like Mitcham and Morden.\nBut that’s not going to happen now, is it? A thousand pounds is too much for people from round here to afford.\nSo I’m asking you to sign a petition. Let’s get the message through to David Cameron – who has often been compared to Flashman – that it’s a really bad idea to charge a commission for the police.\nIf you\nclick here it will take you through to the official e-petition page for the Government. Just fill in your details and press send - then let me know you agree by filling in your details below.\nAnd why not tweet a link to it so your friends can find out more too. Use the hashtag #bobbytax – and you can follow me @siobhainmp.\nI don’t want us to go back to the 1800s.\nTogether let’s try to stop this silly tax on policing.\nThe number of police in Merton has fallen by nearly a fifth since 2010. We’ve got to make sure that those who do get employed are like us, and that the police don’t become the preserve of the rich.\nSTOP PRESS\nI gather the House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee, which is Chaired by Keith Vaz MP, is to look into the Bobby Tax and Certificate in Knowledge of Policing as part of an inquiry into the College of Policing.

And it’s really bad news for St Helier hospital. You can read more here. For the past few months, it’s looked bad. The NHS said it needed to find £370m of savings, and it was considering closing St Helier’s A&E and Maternity Units. But last week, they said they would need to go even further than that. There won’t even be any elective surgery there. That means there will hardly be anything left at St Helier. Epsom Hospital will also lose its A&E and Maternity Unit, although it won’t be downgraded as much as St Helier, and will carry on as a centre for elective care. We’re carrying on the fight to save St Helier. But it’s going to be hard. The next stage is that local GPs, who now run Merton’s NHS through the local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), must meet and give their opinion on the plans. Their meeting is at 12.30pm next Thursday (16 May) at 120 The Broadway, Wimbledon. It’s a public meeting, and you can go along if you want. You can also submit a question here. If you’re interested in coming, Siobhain will be there too. If you want someone to go with, give us a ring. Even if you can’t come, there’s one thing you can do to help. The CCG are planning to consult the public about these plans between June and September – even though this is the time when most people take their annual holidays. So if you’ve got a moment, please write to the CCG saying that you are against the plans, and unhappy that the consultation is taking place over the summer. It would be much better if they delayed the start of the consultation until after the end of the summer holidays! You can email the Chief Officer of Merton CCG at eleanor.brown2@nhs.net (and please send a copy to me too, at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk).

I strongly disagree. I think it will lead to a worse health service for people like me, and will lead to extra costs elsewhere. [Please add something about how the closure of services at St Helier will affect you here.] I am also unhappy that public consultation over this decision might take place during the summer holiday period as most people with an interest in our local NHS are going to be away at some point, and it will be impossible to coordinate events that allow everyone to participate. I strongly urge you to delay the consultation until after the summer holiday period has ended. Yours sincerely, [Please insert your name and address here.] And don’t forget to send a copy of your email to siobhain@mmlp.org.uk – thanks!

So, Siobhain got the rare opportunity of being able to question the Chancellor, leaving him no chance of escape.\nSiobhain took him to task on his appalling record in Government. Under his watch, taxes have risen to their highest level since WW2, and living standards have fallen by 3%. It is the first Parliament EVER where households have been poorer at the end than at its’ start.\nYou can watch a clip of the grilling here: https://twitter.com/Siobhain_Mc/status/1729925334324146662",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_mitcham-morden_monthly-newsletter_september-2013_aspx/content_103.html": "September 2013\nDear friend,\nHello again, and welcome to my monthly newsletter, which this month is a special one-off about giving people a better chance on the jobs market.\nWhen I knock on doors wherever I am in Mitcham, Morden and Colliers Wood, one of people’s biggest concerns is how difficult it is to find a job – especially for young people who are looking for that first opportunity to get on the jobs ladder.\nI’ll be using this newsletter to let you know about a number of programmes to help people into work – including a work experience scheme that I’m organising once again to help young people in Mitcham and Morden get experience of real jobs.\nEven if you’re not looking for work yourself, please have a think about whether there is anyone you can pass all this information onto.\nThere are just over 2,500 people who are officially classified as unemployed in the constituency of Mitcham and Morden, with nearly 800 people have been unemployed for more than a year – and perhaps the biggest concern is that more than 500 young people aged 24 and under are out of work.\nGetting experience of work in Mitcham and Morden\nAnyone who’s been unemployed soon after leaving school or university will remember how dispiriting it is not to know where that first opportunity is going to come from.\nSo later this year, I’ll be relaunching a Work Experience placement scheme.\nThe scheme itself will start in January, but if you are an employer – or if you know anyone who runs a business or voluntary organisation who might like to help a young person get experience in the workplace – I’ve just opened applications for potential job providers.\nIf you want to find out more about employing a young person through the scheme, I’ll be hosting a Business Breakfast on Tuesday 15 October. The event will start at 10am, and will take place at the Civic Centre in Morden, and you can book a place by contacting my assistant Sarah Troke on 020 8542 4835 or by emailing siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. There’ll also be coffee and croissants!\nFull details about the scheme will be available on the 15th, but if you sign up I will include your details in a brochure. You will then receive applications from young people between 16 and 24, who are unemployed and live locally.\nYou will be free to choose who to take on, and the programme will last 12 weeks, beginning on Monday 13 January. The young people will be able to claim fares from the Job Centre. The placements are unpaid (unless employers can afford to pay).\nAt the end of the 12 weeks, the young person should be better equipped for the world of work – we’ve found in the past that many go straight into a new job, and sometimes the placement goes so well that they get a job with the company where they got work experience.\nI’ll be organising a special thank you Graduation Party at the end of the scheme, to which both employers and young people will be invited. Every young person will receive a ‘work experience certificate’.\nIf you are interested, it’s a really worthwhile scheme – I hope to see you on the 15th!\nTraining opportunity 1\nOur local Housing Association, Merton Priory Homes, has just launched a range of free courses to help Merton residents find work. Anyone aged 16 -25 who is out of work, or not in education or training or employment can take part.\nThe programme is designed to make you more employable by providing mentor support, accredited training and work experience. There are courses in fields like construction, or Health and Social Care, as well as how to set up your own business or improve your employability.\nFor more details, click on the link here.\nTraining opportunity 2\nThe excellent Grenfell Housing is another organisation offering help with training and getting into work. They’re just about to start free courses in a range of subjects, from Maths or IT to Book-keeping, Security or Retail.\nYou’ll also get the chance to learn about other skills that will help you get ahead at work, including Health and Safety, First Aid and Food Hygiene. And they’ll also help you out with CV writing and interview skills.\nIf you want to find out more, contact Grenfell on 020 8545 2596 or email training.info@grenfell-housing.co.uk.\nInternships with an Olympics legacy charity\nI’ve also been contacted by the ‘Sported Foundation’. This is an Olympics legacy charity that supports the development of young people from deprived communities through sport, and they are currently looking to offer 2 young people internship opportunities.\nThey’re after people looking for a career in the charity sector, articulate, passionate, bright and ambitious, with good analytical, communication and interpersonal skills, who are able to do Internet research, and to present ideas on paper and in person.\nIf you think this applies to you and you’re passionate about sport and education, there is a Fundraising Internship and a Marketing Internship, 3 months each, starting immediately.\nThey are based not far from Green Park tube station in London, and would be able to offer £100 per week for a 12-week period. If you’re interested, please get in contact with Alexis Lautenschlager at alexis@sported.org.uk.\nA prestigious new employment programme for high fliers\nEarlier this week, a new programme was launched to try and encourage the country’s top graduates to go into social work. In the past, being a social worker for vulnerable children has seemed a bit of a thankless task – but in fact it’s one of the country’s most important jobs.\nWe all know how important it is for our children to grow up in a safe and secure environment. And to achieve that we need high quality social workers.\nThat’s why a new programme has been launched to encourage high-flying university students to go into social work. The programme is called FrontlineSW. It lasts two years, while you undergo on the job training and your salary will be around £19k in the first year, £24k in the second.\nIt’s a terrific scheme, and will really fast track you into an interesting, varied and extremely worthwhile career. If you’re interested in finding out more, you could do a lot worse than have a look at the scheme’s website here.\nAnyhow, that’s all for this month. If you’ve got any ideas for themes or stories to go in future newsletters please do email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk.\nAnd if you know anybody who can help with my work experience programme, or anybody who would benefit from any of the job schemes I’ve mentioned please do pass this email onto them. Getting a good job is a life-changing experience, and I do appreciate it if you could help!\nMy best wishes,\nSiobhain",

I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing all of the lights and decorations going up across our communities, and am looking forward to enjoying the festive season with my family and friends.\nHowever, as we are all too aware, the Christmas season is a difficult time of year for many local people, so please read on to see what services and events are happening locally for those who need a helping hand at this time of year.\nDon’t Be On Your Own This Christmas…\nWhilst Christmas is supposed to be a time spent with friends and family, it doesn’t always work out that way for everybody. If you would otherwise be on your own this Christmas, or if you know someone who would be, then please let them know that they don’t have to be.\nChurches Together in Mitcham – a multi-denominational group of Churches in Mitcham – has teamed up with some local volunteers to offer a free Christmas Lunch for those who might not get one otherwise. It will take place between 11am and 4pm at the New Horizon Centre, South Lodge Avenue, Mitcham, CR4 1LT, and there will be a traditional three-course lunch (with a vegetarian option available), and transport can even be arranged.\nAll of this is by prior arrangement only, so if you would like to reserve a place then please do so by contacting Councillor Judy Saunders on judy.saunders@merton.gov.uk or by ringing her on 07720 565 454.\nThe Alexandra Pub in Wimbledon will also be providing a free Christmas Lunch and a beer for those who would be on their own otherwise. All you have to do is let them know you are coming by emailing alexandra@youngs.co.uk or by ringing 0208 947 7691.\nAdditionally, for those under financial pressure, Wimbledon Foodbank is able to offer temporary relief at what might be a difficult time. Rather than suffer in silence, why not give them a ring on 0208 544 0126.\nI’m sure, like me, you will be heartened to know that at the time of good will our community can pull together to look after those in need.\nKeeping the Kids Busy Over the Holidays…\nWe all know that it isn’t easy to keep your children occupied over the two-weeks Christmas Holiday. Fortunately, the Pollards Hill Library has put on several different events to help keep the kids out of mischief.\nThursday 22nd December – “Astrosaurs – Explore Learning Workshop”, 12.30pm-1.30pm, Pollards Hill Library, South Lodge Avenue, Mitcham, CR4 1LT. For 6-8 years. To book spaces please ring 0208 274 5741.\nDo you think you know all there is to know about ‘Astrosaurs’? Why not come along and design your own alien and help your character complete his own missions!\nThursday 29th December – “How to Hide A Lion – Polka Theatre Storytelling Workshop”, 2.00pm-2.45pm, Pollards Hill Library, South Lodge Avenue, Mitcham, CR4 1LT. For 3-6 years. To book spaces please ring 0208 274 5741.\nBased on the enchanting story by Helen Williams. Come along to this storytelling workshop and get FREE tickets to the Polka Theatre’s ‘World of Stories and Music’ which will be held on Saturday 7th January 2017.\nSiobhain's office over Christmas\nMy next advice surgery will take place on\nFriday 6th January - please give the office a call to book an appointment.\nMy Parliamentary office will be\nopen for calls between Wednesday 28th to Friday 30th December, from between\n10am-4pm - so do call between them to book an appointment for the 6th January.\nChristmas Day Emergency? Here’s some numbers that could help:\nWe all know that sometimes disaster strikes at the most inconvenient of times, but if it happens to you on Christmas Day would you know who to call? I’ve listed below some of the numbers you might need in the event that something goes wrong at the worst possible time: British Gas – Emergency 24/7 Contact Number – 0800 111 999\nNational Grid – Report a Power Cut (London Hotline) – 0800 028 0247\nThames Water – Report a blockage, a burst pipe, or no water from your taps – 0800 316 9800\nMerton Council – Out of Hours Hotline, for social care or homelessness support – 020 8770 5000\nPolice/Fire/Ambulance – 999 (Emergencies Only, 24/7 Hotline)\nHealth Scare over Christmas?\nOur local A&E services are at St. George’s Hospital, Blackshaw Road, SW17 0QT, and St. Helier Hospital, Wrythe Lane, SM5 1AA (thankfully it has been saved!). Both A&E departments are open 24 hours a day/7 days a week, including over weekends and on Christmas Day. Also, if you don't feel you need A&E but still want to see a Doctor, the Wilson Hospital on Cranmer Rd, Mitcham, CR4 4TP is operating a walk-in centre every day, including Christmas Day, from 8am-8pm.\nPharmacies are often able to advise you on minor ailments like sore throats or coughing – so to see a full list of pharmacies that will be open over the holiday period, click HERE.\nPlease take care over Christmas, but in the event you or someone in your family does fall unwell then rest assured that our fabulous local health services are available to you all year round!\nChristmas Tree Recycling and Rubbish Collection Dates\nOnce the festive season is over, you will be pleased to know that Merton Council is once again collecting Christmas trees for composting. This popular local service was started many years ago by Labour. The Council will collect real trees for free up until 29th January 2017. In order to have your tree collected, simply remove all decorations and place it at the front of your property no later than Sunday 8th January where it can be clearly seen from the road, but not on the pavement. If your tree has not been collected by the 29th January then you can let Merton know by completing the missed collection form or calling the refuse team on 020 8274 4902.\nIf you have transport and prefer to do so you can take your Christmas tree to the Garth Road Refuse and Recycling Centre, and place it in the green waste for composting.\nPlease also make sure you are aware of any change of collection dates for your street over the festive period. You can find out the holiday collection times but visiting Merton Council’s website by clicking HERE.You can also use the missed collection form throughout the year if your household rubbish or recycling is not collected on the day it should be.\nA New Take on a Christmas Classic…\nAs you may know, over the past year I have been campaigning to make sure that low paid workers do not lose out as a result of the new, so-called, “National Living Wage” introduced by George Osborne in 2015. Essentially, whilst the minimum rate of pay has gone up, some companies are paying for this wage increase by cutting back on overtime pay, paid lunch breaks, special skills allowances, etc., leaving some workers up to £2,000 worse-off over a year even after an increase in basic pay.\nThe huge advertising and lobbying power these companies have – including some of the most well-known and respected high street brands such as M&S, John Lewis, B&Q – led to newspapers not wanting to cover my campaign very thoroughly. So to help gain publicity for my campaign, I, and several of my MP colleagues, recorded our own version of the song ‘Do They Know Its Christmas?’ with our own lyrics.\nThe song, titled the ‘National Living Rage’, was released last week and has since gone viral. You can watch the video on YouTube by clicking\nHERE. The song has gone viral, and has already been viewed more than 40,000 times on YouTube. All in all, it was a funny (and highly embarrassing) way of raising an important issue. If you’d like to find out more about my campaign, you can do so by visiting\nHERE.\nWith that, all that is left to do is for me to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a joyous and happy New Year! Speak to you again in 2016!\nWith warmest wishes,\nSiobhain McDonagh MP",

Once again, I’ll be focusing on how we can give people a better chance of getting ahead in the jobs market, and letting you have the latest news about my work experience scheme. I’ll also have some details of a great local charity, some help you might be able to get with your energy costs and information about how to have a tour of the Houses of Parliament. But without further ado.... Giving our young people real experience of work Around 800 young people in Mitcham and Morden have been out of work for more than a year. That’s a real worry, not just for the self-esteem of the young people themselves and their parents – but if we allow people to drift into adulthood without ever having got into the habit of going to work every day, we’re storing up big social problems for the future. When I knock on people’s doors each week, it’s clear that helping our young people find work is one of people’s biggest concerns all over Mitcham, Morden and Colliers Wood. So I’ve developed a programme for young people who are looking for that first opportunity to get on the jobs ladder. Even if you’re not looking for work yourself, you might know someone who is, so please pass this on to them. The scheme itself will start in January, but applications are being taken now. I’ve convinced around 60 local businesses and voluntary organisations to offer 80 placements of 8-12 weeks that will give young people a real opportunity to get good experience of a working environment. If you want to find out more please click here to view my latest Directory of Work Experience Opportunities, which contains the full list of what positions are available and how to apply. Employers include Paul Strank Roofing, Canizaro House Hotel, the Mayor of Merton and even the high end watchmakers Rolex. Most are local businesses and charities that want to give our young people a chance to get on. Hopefully, there is something for all tastes. I’m also sending out copies of the brochure to thousands of homes, thanks to the generosity of the engineering company C2HMHill and the trade union for postal workers, the CWU. But if you can forward details of the scheme to any young person you think might be interested, I’d really appreciate your help. At the end of the placement, the young person should be better equipped for the world of work – in the past many have found a new job straight away, or been offered a permanent role where they got work experience. I’ll also hold a special thank you Graduation Party at the end of the scheme, to which both employers and young people will be invited. If you can think of anyone who might be interested, it’s a really worthwhile scheme – I’m sure the applications will flood in, so be quick! You can read more details about the scheme on my website by clicking here. Help with writing cv’s and finding work For anyone of any age thinking about getting a new job, you could do a lot worse than click on my website. It contains several handy guides written by professional head hunters and HR experts for a training event I arranged for local residents to find out more about how to apply for jobs on the Internet and improve their chances of getting employment. Eight out of ten jobs are now advertised on the web, so it’s really important to have the skills to find and apply for these vacancies. You’ll also find top tips on CV writing, interview skills and how to complete application forms. Just click here to find the guides (they’re in bold at the bottom of the page). Help with your heating costs I know you’ve probably not been able to open your newspaper or turn on the TV without hearing a Labour MP bemoaning the cost of living crisis facing many of us at the moment. The rising cost of gas and electricity is a particular concern – and obviously you wouldn’t expect me to let the opportunity pass without saying that I support Ed Miliband’s plan to freeze energy prices once Labour is elected. However, in the mean time I wanted to direct you to the moneysavingexpert.com website, where there are lots of handy hints about how to bring down your costs now. For details of grants that are available for people on lower incomes to improve the efficiency of your boiler or install better insulation, click here. And for advice on whether to switch energy company, or move to a different tariff, click here. Local Diabetes charity needs your support This month, I wanted to highlight the work of one of the area’s best local health charities, the Wimbledon and District Diabetes UK Group. There are 3.8 million people with diabetes and nearly another one million undiagnosed, so it’s an issue that could easily affect you or your family. The group offers a great opportunity to meet other people with diabetes and get information or help with improving your health. Please contact Robert Carew-Hunt on 020 8947 3181 or Iris Hackers on 020 8543 8798 for further details. Visiting Parliament – Local Democracy Week and Merton Mencap One of the best things about being an MP, especially an MP for a constituency in London, is the chance to show local people around the Houses of Parliament. In the week of Guy Fawkes night, I’m always reminded what an amazing building it is, and that there’s so much history there. In the past few weeks, I’ve been delighted to show around over 100 pupils at local primary schools and members of the Merton Goan elderly group, and only a couple of days ago I gave a tour to a group from Merton Mencap. You can catch pictures of the tours here, here, here and here. And watch out for future events by following me on Twitter, where I’m known as @siobhainmp. If you belong to a local group, a charity or residents association, and you want me to organise a tour of Parliament for your members, all you have to do is get in touch by email to siobhain@mmlp.org.uk or by calling my Westminster office on 020 7219 4678. Anyhow, that’s my lot for another month. I hope you’ve found something of interest in this edition. As always, if you can think of anything you’d like me to include in future newsletters please do email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk.",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_mitcham-morden_monthly-newsletter_dec-2014_aspx/content_30.html": "December 2014\nDear friend\nHello again, and welcome back to more on the latest news and events here in Mitcham and Morden as we approach Christmas.\nFirstly I’d like to say a big thank you to all have helped delivering the first batch of 2015 calendars. It is a huge task each year delivering these across the constituency and we rely on members and friends to do this. There are still more to deliver so if you have a spare couple of hours please call Billy in the office on 020 8542 4835 to find out where we need your help.\nLeaseholder Advice Meeting\nI will be hosting a Leaseholder Advice Session at 7.30pm on Thursday 11 December at Morden Assembly Halls, Tudor Drive, SM4 4PJ.\nI have been approached by a number of leaseholders about service charges and the costs of major works. They are concerned that they have little control over these charges – particularly the unexpected bills that crop up from time to time. This is a very complex legal area and leases vary hugely depending on when you bought your home. I am therefore delighted that the Leaseholder Advisory Service (LEASE), Britain’s leading free advice service, have agreed to come and do a Question and Answer session in Morden next Thursday. Please feel free to come along and to let your friends and family know of the event.\nIn order to get the best advice in the Q&A session please bring along your recent Service Charge Bills together with your Section 20 Consultation paperwork.\nAlternatively, a face to face appointment can also be made with LEASE at their central London address by calling them 020 7832 2500.\nChristmas lunch on Jesus\nWhen you get to see your 2015 calendar you’ll notice that December features Ioannis Dekakis of the Doxa Deo Church, based in Wimbledon. Doxa Deo introduced Christmas Lunch on Jesus to Merton in 2012. They provide hampers for families in need, regardless of their faith. Families are nominated by Merton Council and charities including Wimbledon Food Bank and Commonside Trust in Mitcham. If you know of a family that you would like to be considered for a hamper please email me on siobhain@mmlp.org.uk and I will pass their details on.\nAnyone wanting to donate towards a hamper should visit www.cloj.co.uk.\nAs well as finding out more about Christmas Lunch on Jesus on their website you can also register as a volunteer for packing or distributing the hampers (there are more than 600 to deliver). Packing will take place on 20 December and distribution the following day on 21 December.\nChristmas Dinner at Vestry Hall\nLabour councillors and members also cook a community Christmas dinner at Vestry Hall (opposite the Cricket Green, Mitcham) on Christmas Day for all who are isolated and find this time of year difficult. If you know a local person that might like to come along on Christmas Day please call Councillor Judy Saunders on 07720 565454 so that they can be included. Judy would also be pleased to hear from you if you can help with cooking, serving or transporting people to Vestry Hall on Christmas Day.\nLord Mayor’s Parade on New Year’s Day\nFinally, the Lord Mayors Parade on 1 January each year is always great fun and an opportunity to get fresh air after time at home over Christmas. There are floats from London Boroughs in the parade. Thanks to the tremendous effort put in by Councillor Geraldine Standford each year in coordinating the team Merton’s float has regularly won both praise and prizes.\nAll funds raised on the day by the Merton team (including prize money for the float) goes to the Mayor’s charities. This year Merton’s Labour Mayor, Councillor Agatha Akyigyina has nominated Shooting Star Chase Children’s Hospice and Street Pastors as her chosen charities.\nGeraldine is appealing for help with carrying parts of the float on the walk. Please contact Geraldine on 020 8715 6667 if you can help on the day. You will need to be available for rehearsals in late December as well as from 8am on 1 January. You will get breakfast before the parade to keep you going for the 2 mile walk and the walking on the day.\nThanks for all you do to make Mitcham and Morden such a strong community – and remember if there’s anything you want included in next month’s email please get in touch – you can email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk.\nMy best wishes",

Each and every day, families across the\ncountry celebrate this miraculous chance to start a family.\nHowever, 40 years on and there is still a glaring omission in IVF law: the welfare of women.\nFor some women, this life-changing opportunity comes with life-changing consequences.\nAnd so Siobhain is calling for an explicit commitment to women's welfare to be added to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, bringing forward a Bill to Parliament calling for the law to be amended.\nSiobhain's Bill seeks an explicit commitment to safeguard the welfare of women in relation to the effects of marketing and advertising, the emotional effects, and the financial effects of IVF. It calls for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to be required to collect information about all drugs and dosages administered to women during IVF and early pregnancy. And it aims to link the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's registry with hospital, cancer and death registers. This is particularly important in light of the evidence that drug protocols can cause women such extremely adverse health effects.\nThe Bill is now ready for the Second Reading in Parliament.",

That was the damning verdict of the Right Honourable Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in 2017. The 9,712 residents on the housing register in Merton would certainly agree with him. Perhaps the most visible indication of our broken housing market is the 9,000 rough sleepers on our streets. But the homeless crisis that this country faces is far greater. And it is hidden. Hidden in hostels, hidden in B&Bs and hidden in converted warehouses.\nIn total, there are 79,190 households in temporary accommodation - a 65% rise since 2010. Of these, 28% have been placed away from their jobs, schools, friends and family in a different local government area. 6,400 of these households are in B&Bs, with many placed here far longer than the 6 week legal limit.\nSiobhain's speech in November in the House of Commons calling for the right to build and the right to buy.\nThere can be no doubt as to the responsibility for this country's deplorable housing crisis. The December report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee explicitly read that the Department for Communities and Local Government has had an 'unacceptably complacent' attitude to reducing homelessness. Their current plans to tackle this issue are said to address only the tip of the iceberg and there is an unacceptable shortage of realistic housing options for the homeless.\nBut, of course, many of us knew this already. The last time the Government target of 300,000 new homes in one year in England was achieved was almost half a century ago. The difference back then was that councils and housing associations were building new homes.\nIf the Government is to achieve this target, councils simply have to play their part. And that's why I'm calling upon the Government to grant Local Authorities the Right To Build and the Right To Buy so that housing can be let to families on low incomes at social housing rents.\nMy campaign has now featured on BBC, ITV and Channel 4 News, but the wait goes on so that the 128,000 children who are currently homeless can finally have a place to call home.\nSiobhain's speech in December in the House of Commons calling for the right to build and the right to buy.",

Hello again, and this month there is really just one thing to talk about, isn’t there? There has been some major news about the future of St Helier, some good, some bad, which I’ll go into in a moment. So what better time to hand in the community’s petition to Save St Helier? I’ve arranged to present the petition to the Chair and Chief Executive of Merton CCG (the local branch of the NHS). If you want to join me, I’ll be handing the petition in at 9am next Thursday, 27 March. The presentation will take place at the headquarters of Merton CCG, 120 The Broadway, Wimbledon SW19 1RH. The petition has been signed by thousands of local people, and the more who can join me next Thursday, the better. The threat to St Helier is still very real, and we need to show those in charge that the people of Mitcham and Morden are still extremely anxious. Good and bad news for St Helier So much has happened over the past month or so, so let’s start with the good news. Thanks to a really strong community campaign, the local NHS has backed away from the threat to shut St Helier’s A&E, maternity, ICU, children’s and renal units, as well as 390 in-patient beds. Better still, the body behind the proposals has been closed down. However, the plan is not off the table permanently. I’ve seen a letter from NHS England complaining that the decision not to shut St Helier “carries unacceptable risks to your ability to develop and deliver a strategic plan”, and that as a result local hospitals “will be unable to become Foundation Trusts.” This is particularly worrying, because if St Helier doesn’t get Foundation Trust status, it will have to close services. The letter goes on to say that “This could be interpreted as commissioners planning for clinical and financial failure in some of its providers.” Again, that looks like an admission that the NHS expects hospitals like St Helier to fail – another back door way to ensure it closes services. So we need to keep up the fight! And here’s why. Last month I uncovered the truth about the £219m promised to St Helier four years ago by the last Government. This money was going to lead to the hospital being rebuilt and modernised. But then I found out the £219m wouldn’t be spent. The Chief Executive of the local NHS told me \"the re-development does not feature as one of the Long-Term Financial Modelling scenarios being worked up.\" A fortnight ago, the banner outside St Helier saying “Coming Soon – We’re spending £219m on a major development of St Helier hospital” was taken down. Even more worryingly, earlier this week the Government passed a new law in Parliament allowing them to close a hospital even if the local community, including local doctors, wants to keep it open. Sadly, local Conservative MP Stephen Hammond, and local Liberal Democrat MPs Paul Burstow and Tom Brake, voted for the new law, which is known as Clause 119. I voted against. All of this means that although we’ve made great progress, it’s clear this isn’t over! So please do try to join me on Thursday – and join me for a coffee afterwards. It would be good to show that we are not going to give up the fight now – I’m not going to rest until it’s clear that the future of St Helier is secure for future generations. And on that note, if you want to add your name to the petition – or want to contact me about anything else at all – please do email me at siobhain@mmlp.org.uk. I’ll be back with more next month!

You can read the interview online, or below. Why did you become an MP? I was born and bred in Mitcham and Morden: it is an area I love full of the most wonderful people I know. I was so proud to be elected in 1997, but I had been contesting the seat since 1987, and had served as a councillor since 1982. I never wanted to represent any other area but my home town. I believe that public service is about standing up for people and I have been working as tirelessly as I can to represent and work with the people of Mitcham and Morden. I am very lucky to do a job that I absolutely love. What is a favourite part of your job? The best part of public service is helping people. When people come to speak to me at my weekly surgeries, or call in on the phone, they are often really struggling, whether it’s because of benefit sanctions, home office decisions, or waiting on the housing register. The best feeling in the world is doing something that can help them. What are some of the projects you hope to take on in the near future? Getting on in life, whether it’s owning your own home or finding a job that gives you financial security and even the opportunity to work your way up, is getting harder than ever. We are letting our young people down, many of whom will never be able to own their own home, and are penalised by housing benefit legislation and are excluded from forthcoming minimum wage increases. Families face tax credit cuts of thousands of pounds a year, and child tax credit cuts limited to just two children, will mean more and more families will face poverty. We need to fight for more affordable housing both to buy and rent. We need to help our young people get on in life, ensuring they have access to good education and meaningful jobs and careers. These are the sorts of challenges I’m trying to take on by holding David Cameron to account. Are there any projects you are currently working on? Our present Conservative government is not too interested in people being able to get on, and as Labour is in opposition, that means we can’t introduce the sort of legislation we would have wanted, to make Britain a fairer place for everyone. But I am working on a work experience scheme in Mitcham and Morden which focuses on getting unemployed young people the internships and work experiences they need to get on. I’ve been running the scheme since 2011 and I’m proud to say it is increasing in size and impact each year, helping hundreds of young people in the local area get into meaningful employment. I remember how hard it was to find a job in the 1980s, and many of my friends were not as fortunate as I was. I was lucky to get a clerical job and eventually worked my way up into something more rewarding. But young people today have it even tougher – and I wanted to do something to change that. I rally together local Mitcham and Morden businesses to offer structured, medium-term placements, and then match young people with the placements that interest them, in all sorts of areas, including charity work, schools, construction, retail, and law. I’m very proud of the scheme and of the students and businesses that have got involved. What are some of your best accomplishments to help the area of Mitcham/Morden, in your opinion? There has been so much that we have achieved over the last eighteen years. We’ve secured two Academy schools for East Mitcham, and area that’s been really struggling with attainment grades, which I was very proud of. But I think the biggest, ongoing campaign has been that of saving St Helier Hospital. The fight is certainly not over, but I am very proud that we have managed to keep St Helier open despite everything that has been thrown at us. This is a huge accomplishment for the hundreds of campaigners involved, but we have a long road ahead.",

From timber windows to motor works, scaffolders to joiners, it is one of the busiest industrial estates in South London. But almost 2 years ago now there was a peculiar change in the estate. The businesses began to notice prams walking before their front doors. They began to notice children playing whilst their lorries and vans raced through. They began to notice hundreds of residents using their working industrial estate as a home.\nLocal authorities can no longer cope. They are doing all they can to keep families off the street. The video below shows the plight of 84 families and over 200 children living in a south London warehouse. This crisis is every bit as bad as ‘Cathy come home’ in the 60s.\nConnect House is at the heart\nof Willow Lane Industrial Estate and houses 84 families who have been placed\nhere by four different local authorities: Bromley, Sutton, Croydon and Merton. To reach the\nnearest amenities, the residents have to walk through the industrial estate\nitself. Cars line the pavement forcing those families with prams or wheelchairs\ninto the lorry-filled road. It is fair to say that the local workers are simply\nnot expecting 84 families to live within their working industrial estate. A\nbusy car park is no place for the hundreds of children living in this building.\nThe Guardian visited Connect House to hear what daily life is like. You can see their powerful video here:\nIt was also discussed live on air by LBC Radio and you can see their accompanying piece here:\n150 children are living in this modern-day slum in south London - and it's affecting their health. pic.twitter.com/P4XMKJDxtw\nDue to the national government’s policy of getting out of public housing (social housing has halved since 2010) we now have a housing crisis with 120,170 children in temporary emergency housing or on the move every 6 or 12 months due to insecure tenancies. The impact on their education and well-being has not yet been calculated.\nOver 28% of 78,180 households\nin temporary accommodation are housed outside their local authority’s area, a\nsimply remarkable increase of 248% between March 2011 and March 2017. As of\nJune this year, 6,660 households are being temporarily housed in B&Bs –\ntwice as many as in 2011 and almost 3 times as many as when the Conservatives\ncame to power in 2010.\nThis housing situation is\nterrible for families and unbelievably expensive for the tax payer. Since 2010\nGovernment has spent an additional £10 billion to house families in temporary or\nprivate rented accommodation.\nSiobhain's campaign has been covered widely by national media. Below is one of several BBC reports on the issue.\nPlease be aware that the suggestion at the end of this report that all 4 councils are moving residents out of this building is not correct.\nWe must call on the\nGovernment to ensure temporary housing meets suitable standards; that local\nauthorities have a designated officer made aware of a family’s arrival; and\nthat the law is enforced so that no family is housed in abhorrent B&Bs for\nlonger than 6 weeks.\nYou can watch and read further reports from Siobhain's campaign here:",

Over 148 years, they have established a\nreputation as a leading retailer that looks after and out for their colleagues\nand customers. That’s why their proposals to force unscrupulous contract\nchanges upon their staff are so appalling.\nOn the table for 9,000 of their most loyal and\nlongstanding employees is a pay cut of up to £3,000 per year, all under the\nguise of an ‘increase in basic pay’. Why? Because Sainsbury’s are scrapping\npaid breaks and Sunday premium pay, shortening the nightshift, and removing the\nbonus scheme for shop floor staff (though the management will of course keep\ntheir bonuses…)\nAnd for those staff who refuse to sign these new\ncontracts? They will be forced to resign.\nAgainst all\nSainsbury’s values, they are forcing thousands of dedicated staff to ‘work well\nfor less’.\nWe have a duty to ensure that\ntheir voices are heard.\nTake Jayne, a night shift worker at Sainsbury’s for over\n30 years, set to lose £2,000 per year. She loves her job and desperately wants\nto stay but does not think she can afford\nto do so. She describes morale in her store as ‘at rock bottom’ and tells me\nthat she is beyond frustrated that her decades of loyal service appear to count\nfor nothing.\nBut Jayne is one of dozens of negatively affected staff\nwho have written to me from across the country. And so I have met, twice, with\nsenior Sainsbury’s staff in Parliament to raise their concerns.\nIt was the language used in these meetings by Simon\nRoberts, Retail and Operations Director, that shocked me most. After confirming\nthat thousands of staff will lose out under their proposals, Mr Roberts\ndescribed those losing the highest figures as ‘anomalies’. But I don’t see them\nas anomalies. I see them as longstanding, loyal staff who have dedicated\ndecades of their lives to the organisation. Besides, it is disingenuous of him\nto try to skew the figures by discounting those who are most negatively\nimpacted by these changes.\nI can only imagine how infuriated these 9,000 staff must\nhave felt when watching Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe singing ‘We’re in the Money’\non ITV News.\nAnd so, earlier this month, I sang my own version of the song at Prime Minister’s Questions, after which the Prime Minister\npromised to look at the issue. I followed this up with a letter to her signed\nby 114 MPs and currently await a response. Since then I have called upon the\nBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee in Parliament to summon Mr\nCoupe to justify how he can rob Peter to save Paul under these proposals.\nHow can a\ncompany that made a pre-tax profit of £589m last year, with a CEO that receives\n£930,000 before bonuses, think it is right to force a pay cut on their most\nlongstanding members of staff?\nOf course, this is just the latest setback for workers’\nrights in this country. Almost a year has now passed since the Taylor Report,\nwith over 1 million workers still trapped in a workers’-rights-lacking gig\neconomy. The number of zero hours contracts has grown by over 600% since 2008.\nAnd real wages will have been in decline for 17 years by the time they are\nexpected to return in 2025 to their pre-crash level.\nAs for Sainsbury’s, they aren’t the first to treat their\nmost loyal staff in such an appalling manner. Marks and Spencer’s followed the\nsame path 2 years ago and we all know what’s happening to them now… Meanwhile,\nthe complicated merger with ASDA has added an extra layer of confusion for\nstaff who see their jobs as less secure than ever before.\nBut Sainsbury’s has the chance to buck the trend. The\nconsultation is halfway through, with the new contracts set to be signed by\nSeptember. The pay rise on offer for the majority of their staff should be\nwelcomed and encouraged. But this should not be to the detriment of others.\nThey defend the changes on the lines of ‘fairness’, arguing that long-serving\nstaff should see their contracts scaled down to match the poorer conditions on\noffer for new staff today. How about they level up terms & conditions,\nrather than down? That sounds fairer to me.\n120,000 colleagues and customers have now signed a\nstaff-led petition via change.org calling for a show of loyalty: https://www.change.org/p/support-sainsbury-s-shop-floor-staff-s-working-rights-we-re-not-in-the-money and I would encourage all readers to sign and share this\npetition using the hashtag #workwellforless.\nThe staff consultation is approaching its latter stages\nand the voices of discontent are growing and amplifying. It’s not too late for\nSainsbury’s to rectify their increasingly damaged brand.\nYou can read\nmore about this issue in the press: Press Association, Mirror, Independent, Guardian, Daily\nMail, The\nTimes, The\nTelegraph, City AM.\nYou can see my\nquestion to the Prime Minister here:",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_mitcham-morden_monthly-newsletter_dec-13_aspx/content_54.html": "December 2013 Home / Mitcham and Morden / Newsletters / December 2013 HAPPY CHRISTMAS AND A PEACEFUL NEW YEAR! Well, it’s that time of year when we look back over the last 12 months, and look forward to the future. So here’s my quick Review of 2013. Obviously, it’s been another hard year for many people in Mitcham and Morden. The squeeze is on and many people are struggling with the cost of living. But here in Mitcham and Morden we have a strong community and so many of you are willing to give up your time and energy to help others. I am so proud of our local community and the people who make it tick. Anyway, here’s my run through some of the biggest issues of the last year. I hope you enjoy it! Giving our young people real experience of work I knock on people’s doors each week, and sadly unemployment among our young people remains one of the area’s biggest concerns, with around 800 young people in Mitcham and Morden out of work for more than a year. Helping our young people find work is one of my top priorities. So I’ve taken the bull by the horns and gone out to develop a programme to help young people get that first opportunity on the jobs ladder. The placements will start next month, and I’ve convinced around 60 local businesses and voluntary groups to offer over 80 placements of 8-12 weeks to give young people a real opportunity to get good experience of a working environment. Employers include Paul Strank Roofing, Canizaro House Hotel, the Mayor of Merton and even Rolex. Most are local businesses and charities who want our young people to get on. Interviews are being held this month, so good luck to all the young people taking part. At the end of their placement, they should be better equipped for the world of work. I should also thank the engineering company C2HMHill and the trade union for postal workers, the CWU, for their generosity with printing and postage so that I could produce booklets and send them out to thousands of young people who live in the area. The future of St Helier in the balance Once again, the year has been dominated by the Save St Helier campaign. Together, the community is fighting the threat to shut St Helier’s A&E, maternity, ICU, children’s and renal units, as well as 390 in-patient beds – all because our local NHS has to save £370m a year. Thank you to everyone who has got involved in the campaign, especially Lower Morden resident Sally Kenny, who has set up a local campaign and whose Save St Helier posters are up in so many people’s windows. It might not feel like it, but we’re making a big difference. In the past few weeks, it looks as though work on closing the A&E, maternity unit and numerous other wards at St Helier and Epsom hospitals might have stalled. The reasons for this are complex. In part it’s due to the success of community campaigners in Lewisham, who won a high court battle to save their local hospital with the backing of their local Council. I’ve been working very closely with Lewisham activists. They said that the key thing that ensured victory in Lewisham was that local GPs were against the hospital closure. That’s why I asked local residents here to contact Merton’s GPs to oppose the closure plans. If you were one of the people who contacted your GP, thank you! Meanwhile it looks as though a number of GPs across a wider area have said they are not convinced that services should close at Epsom or St Helier, and since then, the people behind the plans to close services at St Helier and Epsom have gone very quiet. This is not the end of the matter, of course, because there are still people in the Government who want to make these cuts. Earlier this week, the Government amended the so-called Care Bill to make it easier to close a hospital. However, the longer this goes on, the more it is clear that closing St Helier would cost more than it saves, and that GP surgeries couldn’t cope with the extra patients. Improving the Colliers Wood Tower It might not look like it from the outside, but actually it’s been a good year too for all of us who hate the ugly black Colliers Wood Tower. Progress is painfully slow, but we have kept up the pressure. Thanks to the determination of local Councillors to use environmental powers to force the owners to fix the building, the car park has been demolished, hoardings have been put up to secure the site, and a service road has been laid out. And now the owners say they are planning to start internal conversion works in the new year. Of course, we’ve heard promises before, but last month the owners came to Colliers Wood to meet residents for the first time and we can only hope that’s a good sign. Meanwhile, the Council has also secured money to make the area around the tube station and the Tower look a bit nicer. As I’ve said before, this has been a very long saga, but with a new coffee shop Coffee in the Wood, the extension of the Holiday Inn, the launch of the Provenance pub and other improvements to the area, it looks as though Colliers Wood is on the up at last. Sadly, one of the Colliers Wood Councillors, Gam Gurung – Britain’s first ever Gurkha to become a Councillor – lost his battle with cancer in the summer. Caroline Cooper-Marbiah has since replaced him, joining existing Councillors Laxmi Attawar and Nick Draper, and the improvements to Colliers Wood are a tribute to Gam’s (and Caroline, Laxmi and Nick’s) determination to support their local community. Great work from local volunteers – but more sad news I can’t stop saying it, but it’s a real privilege to be an MP for such a great community. Many wonderful people give up their time to make the area a better place. When you’re a Member of Parliament, you get to see so many community organisations and voluntary groups working really hard to help local residents. It’s not easy. Budgets are more stretched than ever, but I am always amazed at how many volunteers there are, and by the help they are prepared to give. Our local voluntary sector is recognised across the country, regularly winning awards for the work they do. However, this year the plaudits have been tinged with sadness because last month, the night after picking up yet another national award, the head of Merton’s Voluntary Sector Council, Chris Frost, passed away suddenly in her sleep. Chris was a real force of nature, and inspired many volunteers and local charities to excel. She made many friends and I know that all her colleagues in the voluntary sector miss her enormously. At this time of year, my thoughts are with her family and her many friends. Award-winning Merton Council Earlier this year, Merton Council was named the best Council in the country when it won the prestigious MJ Outstanding Council of the Year award. Obviously, that doesn’t mean it never gets anything wrong, but despite the financial problems facing all local councils, they have done a pretty good job over the past few years. Since 2010, the Council has been led by Stephen Alambritis, whose previous job was at the top of the Federation of Small Businesses, and it looks as though his reputation for running things in a business-like manner is making a difference. His team have instilled financial discipline, freezing Council Tax for a record 3 years (with the promise of another freeze in 2014) and – unlike most Councils – refusing to cut Council Tax rebates for people on low incomes. And although they’ve had to make tens of millions of savings, they’ve done their best to protect priority services. Unlike many other Boroughs, they’ve not only kept all our libraries open, but actually extended their hours. And last month, they announced plans to rebuild Morden swimming pool, to make it a leisure centre where the whole family can go to get fit – or just splash around. Previous plans had been overblown and relied on external funding that was never going to be given, but after going through the budget with a fine tooth comb, Stephen and his team have trimmed costs and believe it’s now affordable – and they’ll be consulting residents about the plans in the new year. More great sporting opportunities You may not have realised, but Mitcham and Morden is home to the oldest Little League in the country, so even if you’re not quite Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard there are still opportunities to get involved. Mitcham Little League is a great organisation, and it’s currently looking for help. So whether you have football experience or not, if you can help them put on football matches for local kids that's great. They’re also looking for volunteers to help with admin work, fundraising, working in the canteen, and so on. All they ask is for 2-3 hours of your time on a Saturday. Any potential volunteers who might be interested in becoming part of the work they do at Mitcham Little League should simply contact Mark or Daryl Ann at mark.ann@live.co.uk or darylann2012@hotmail.co.uk. Thanks for your help! Celebrating our country’s Parliament Hardly a week goes by without me having the opportunity to show local groups around the Houses of Parliament. It’s an amazing building, with so much history. For instance, in the week of Guy Fawkes night, it was great to have the chance to show over 100 pupils at local primary schools around. I’ve also hosted tours for police cadets, charities, residents associations and local clubs. In the past few weeks I’ve hosted tours for members of the Merton Goan elderly group, a group from Merton Mencap and women from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, and just today, I gave a tour for a group of students from South Thames College. It’s always fun to show people the voting chambers and the scene of countless rowdy Parliamentary occasions – it’s a chance for you to pretend to be David Cameron or Ed Miliband (or even me!). So if you belong to a local group, a charity or residents association, and want me to organise a tour of Parliament for your members, simply email me on siobhain@mmlp.org.uk or ring my Westminster office on 020 7219 4678. These tours are always great fun! A very merry Christmas Finally, I just want to mention an annual scheme run by a local group to help people who are alone at Christmas. The festive period can be a difficult time for some of our residents, and that is why Churches Together in Mitcham offer company and activities – as well as a full 3-course home cooked Christmas Dinner – for anyone who is on their own on Christmas Day. It all takes place from 11am on Christmas Day at the Mitcham Parish Centre on Church Path. If you know anyone who might be interested they can book a place by contacting the organiser, Councillor Judy Saunders on 07720 565454 or 020 8640 1298 or judy.saunders@merton.gov.uk. So there you go. Yet another example of great local people doing wonderful things to help this fantastic community of ours. A very good note on which to say goodbye. So Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! Have a lovely time over the next few weeks. My best wishes, Siobhain McDonagh MP",

Because when schools closed, it wasn’t just lunch\nthat disadvantaged children missed out on. It was connectivity.\nThrough the lockdown, millions of children started the day with\nJoe Wicks’ online exercise classes, they completed schoolwork sent remotely by\ntheir teachers and they joined their classmates in live remote learning lessons.\nIt wasn’t perfect, but it was an extraordinary feat achieved thanks to the dedication\nof our teachers and the support and patience of home-schooling parents.\nBut the lockdown exposed the digital divide in our society. Whilst\naround 30% of private school pupils attended four or more online lessons per\nday during the first lockdown, just 6.3% of state school pupils did the same. That’s\nno surprise considering 1 in 5 children did not always have access to a device\nfor online learning while schools were closed.\nHow did those children log in and learnt from home? The answer is\nsimple: they didn’t. They have fallen even further behind.\nThe Government’s rollout of devices was nothing short of shambolic.\n5% of teachers in state schools reported that all their students have a device,\ncompared to 54% at private schools. The National Audit Office even concluded in\nMarch that the Department for Education didn’t even aim to\nprovide equipment to all children who lacked it. Every click simply widened the\nattainment gap. So much for levelling up.\nWith schools open and lockdown lifting, this is no problem for the\npast. The days of pen and paper are long gone and the technological age we now\nlive in is here to stay. Homework. Research. Resources. Catch up. So much is\nnow online. The consequence for those children on the wrong side of the digital\ndivide is that they are now even more disadvantaged than before.\nAnd so I say that support for children entitled to free school\nmeals must be about more than just the food. I am calling for all children\nentitled to free school meals to have the support of internet access and an\nadequate device so that they can log in and catch up from home. I recognise that\nfree school meals are an imperfect indicator of need, but it’s the best one\nwe’ve got.\nCompared to the vast sums squandered throughout the pandemic, this\nis a low cost, straightforward and tangible step forward. It’s no silver bullet\nbut it would make a life changing difference to those children on the wrong\nside of the digital divide.\nTake 10-year-old Abi in our constituency. In lockdown, she secured\nentry to Tiffin Girl’s, one of the most prestigious grammar schools in the\ncountry, working in a cramped homeless hostel with only a refurbished, donated Tesco\nMobile to get her connected.\nSocial mobility… Levelling up… Call it whatever you want. The\nimpact for Abi will be lifelong.\nWhat will it take before we all agree that no child should be left\nbehind because of their internet connection?",

After going to Essex University, she worked as a clerk at the DHSS and a receptionist at Wandsworth Council's Homeless Families Unit, before becoming Development Manager at Battersea Churches Housing Trust. Siobhain joined the Labour Party when she was just 15, and in 1982 became London's youngest councillor when she was elected to Merton Council. As Chair of the Housing Committee she set about demolishing the tower blocks in Phipps Bridge, replacing them with proper homes and gardens. Siobhain was the Labour candidate for Mitcham and Morden in the 1987 and 1992 general elections, before eventually winning in 1997. As a local MP, she has led a variety of campaigns, including to open a new train station at Mitcham Eastfields, to improve exam results by replacing 3 struggling schools with brand new Academies, to introduce new community ‘Safer Neighbourhood’ police teams, and to tackle graffiti, abandoned cars, vandalism and other anti-social behaviour. In particular, she has campaigned to improve local health services, leading calls to re-open the Wilson Hospital in Mitcham and save the A&E and Maternity Units at St Helier Hospital. Most recently she has campaigned to get TFL to consider a new station at Tooting Broadway, rather than Balham. Siobhain is renowned as one of the country’s hardest-working MPs, and regularly heads the list of MPs who have written the most letters, taking up thousands of new cases on behalf of constituents every year. She regularly speaks in Parliament, championing the importance of social mobility and affordable housing both to buy and to rent. You can read about Siobhain's most recent interventions here. She lives in Colliers Wood with her sister Margaret, within 5 minutes’ walk of the house where she was brought up and where her mum, a retired nurse, still lives.

Most of the children who died were under the age of 1 and died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Many of the children died because they did not have access to a cot during their stay.\nIt is shocking that in the 5th largest economy in the world, children are dying due to a lack of access to a cot.

Mr Ritchie added: “Many of the retail staff we talk to often work well over normal working hours just to make ends meet.“I’m not sure how many of these workers will view their pay packets and see a ‘living wage’; in fact it’s likely that they will see an ‘existence wage’ - being forced to make tough daily decisions from deciding if they can switch on the heating or do a weekly shop.“The voluntary Living Wage rewards a hard day’s work with a fair day’s pay.”\nLabour MP Siobhain McDonagh estimated some B&Q workers could lose up to £50 a week.\nShe said: “B&Q is pretending to be a great employer by introducing the National Living Wage. But in reality, it is taking money away from their poorest paid shop floor workers.\n“It’s a national scandal and I hope that everybody will realise that popular retailers like B&Q and so many others are all at it.\n“Thousands of shopfloor workers are silently having their wages cut under the guise of the national living wage.”\nB&Q said it was still consulting staff and pointed out the rise would apply regardless of age. It added: “B&Q is committed to being a good payer.”Tesco previously announced cuts to holiday and night-time bonuses under a new deal that will see 250,000 store staff receive a 3.1% increase in basic pay. Last September, Morrisons said it would increase pay for 90,000 shopfloor staff to £8.20 an hour from March.Some of the increase will be offset by changes to benefits - including the end of extra pay for Sundays and paid breaks.'",

It was provisionally rejected on 29 December 2016, which means that it could be withdrawn from new patients as early as June 2017, depending on the final decision that will be made in early 2017.\nIt is therefore very timely to have a debate to ensure that access to this drug is discussed in Parliament, as\nwell as the broader issue of access to both new innovative and off-patent drugs for breast cancer, which thousands of patients are dependent upon. This issue has a great deal of cross-party interest, particularly as breast cancer continues to be the most common cancer in the UK.\nYou can read the full motion below:\n'That this House notes the provisional decision not to provide the breast cancer drug Kadcyla for use in the NHS on 29 December 2016; and calls on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and pharmaceutical company Roche to come together and re-assess this decision to ensure Kadcyla is kept available for patients, and considers how access to both innovative new breast cancer drugs and off-patent drugs used for breast cancer, such as bisphosphonates, can be improved.'\nSiobhain McDonagh (Mitcham and Morden) (Lab)\nI beg to move,\nThat this House notes the provisional decision not to provide the breast cancer drug Kadcyla for use in the NHS on 29 December 2016; and calls on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and pharmaceutical company Roche to come together and re-assess this decision to ensure Kadcyla is kept available for patients, and consider how access to both innovative new breast cancer drugs and off-patent drugs used for breast cancer, such as bisphosphonates, can be improved.\nI thank the Backbench Business Committee for the swift manner in which it allocated time to have this important debate. I want to put the spotlight on an issue that affects the lives of millions of people—those who are living with breast cancer and their family and friends. I am sure that almost everyone here today will know someone who has had this disease. My own friends have suffered from breast cancer, and I am so pleased that many of them are in the Public Gallery to watch today’s debate. I have received a large amount of communication on this, including as late as last night in a message from a Vivienne Ashley, who cannot be here today but will be watching on TV.\nThe disease affects people irrespective of their class or job. Many hon. Members have suffered from breast cancer, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol West (Thangam Debbonaire)—also my Whip—who has had a great recovery. An Opposition Member approached me only yesterday to explain that she was receiving treatment, and that although she wanted to be involved in the debate, she felt the issue was too close to her to do so at the moment.\nI am sure all Members would agree that we need a health system in which the most effective cancer treatments are available to all patients. Today, I want to let people living with cancer, especially secondary breast cancer, know that we have not given up on them and that we all want an NHS that provides us all with access to the most effective treatments.\nSir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con)\nIf the deliberations used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, particularly for metastatic breast cancer, take insufficient account of the needs of young families to spend more time with their mothers, is the remedy something that NICE itself can provide by altering the way it goes about those deliberations, or is it something that we in this House and the Government need to do?\nSiobhain McDonagh\nThe answer to the right hon. Gentleman’s question is both. There are issues with how NICE assesses new drugs, particularly cutting-edge drugs such as Kadcyla. He will know, because of his involvement in the last Government, that they established the cancer drugs fund. It is not an either/or, but something we all need to come together to discuss, and that people with more scientific knowledge than me might wish to consider.\nNorman Lamb (North Norfolk) (LD)\nI congratulate the hon. Lady on securing this important debate. Does she share my concern at news that the Government appear to be ready to leave the European Medicines Agency following the Brexit vote? Many people fear that that will lead to a slow-down in access to new medicines. She talks about the importance of NHS patients getting access to medicines; this could make the situation worse and leave us disadvantaged compared with other countries in Europe.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nBreast cancer knows no boundaries, whether class, social or geographic. Anything that reduces access to better forms of treatment is detrimental.\nThe ability to lead an enriched and longer life as a result of medical advances should not be limited only to those who can afford private healthcare. Those advances should be accessible to us all. This debate will focus particularly on the provision of the breast cancer drug Kadcyla, which is under threat. Most Members will be aware of the lease of life that Kadcyla has brought to thousands of women in England with incurable secondary breast cancer. These women rely on Kadcyla to enrich their lives and to give them extra precious years to live. Indeed, in many ways it is a revolutionary drug. By targeting cancer cells directly, it helps to reduce the number of side effects, boosting women’s quality of life immeasurably. Members who have heard these women talk about their experiences will be humbled to learn of the distress and despair that they face as a result of NICE’s decision to provisionally reject the future use of Kadcyla on the NHS.\nToday we are all supporting Breast Cancer Now’s “Keep Kadcyla” campaign to encourage NICE to reverse its decision and enable continued access to the drug, which both improves the quality of life and extends the lives of thousands of women in this country, on the NHS. Since NICE’s decision was announced at the end of December, thousands of people throughout the country have had their views heard. They have signed the petition and contacted their local MPs to ask that we do not give up on women, on the children who are dependent on mothers, and on the families who want that precious extra time with their loved ones. That is why we are all here today: to raise our collective voice in support of these women and defend the treatment that allows them to live their lives.\nThe focus of much of what I have to say today will be on Kadcyla, but we also need to consider other specific breast cancer drugs, as well as the broader issue of how decisions about access to treatment are made. Unfortunately, we are yet to see any improvements in access to off-patent drugs, some of which can prevent the development of certain cancers, thereby saving countless lives, as well as saving the NHS a great deal of money. Just a few months ago, the front pages of national newspapers highlighted the poor access to vital bisphosphonate drugs, which can prevent women from developing secondary cancer, yet the Government have barely acknowledged the problem of access to such treatment. I look forward to hearing from the Minister about when we can expect tangible results regarding access to off-patent drugs, including bisphosphonates. To be clear, many of the women who today owe their lives to Kadcyla might never have developed secondary breast cancer had they had access to bisphosphonate drugs in the first place.\nNick Thomas-Symonds (Torfaen) (Lab)\nI will discuss off-patent drugs in my own speech, but on bisphosphonates, which are in the category of repurposed drugs, is my hon. Friend as concerned as I am about the UK-wide survey undertaken by the UK Breast Cancer Group in March last year, which showed that currently only 24% of breast cancer clinicians are offering bisphosphonates to patients? That is something that the Government could urgently address.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nI completely agree with my hon. Friend and hope to say a little more about that later in my speech.\nThis debate is about not just Kadcyla, but the lives of the thousands of women who rely on it to survive, so I want to share the words and experiences of two of my friends whose lives have been transformed by having access to Kadcyla. One of my friends is present today—I went to primary school with her, but I shall not tell the House just how many years ago that might have been. Her name is Samantha, and she said:\n“\nWhen I got the breast cancer diagnosis, I glibly thought—oh it’s OK I’ll get cured, but sadly about 18 months ago I found out that this wasn’t the case and my cancer had spread to my liver. And that’s when I really knew that my cancer meant business!\nAnd that is where Kadcyla comes in. You see for breast cancer, although I coped and kept going with surgery, chemo and radiotherapy, it was grim. I worked a bit, but regular chemotherapy is not a doddle. Exhaustion and hair loss is just the least of it.\nPutting on a brave face and wearing a wig is just a surface issue, getting up vomiting and going to work to deal with the VAT is about the hardest thing I have ever done. It wasn’t simply because I don’t have enough sick pay at work to cover my mortgage, I actually like work—work allows me to make my contribution, and I think that’s pretty near the most important thing, making my life make a difference. And Kadcyla? Well that means that my life isn’t over, it really gives me hope.\nThere is a big hole where my 45 mm tumour used to be in my liver, and scar tissue and other bits, but I am cancer free without having to take another year off my life. My work is precious; I have kept the business going. Eight people are employed, because I could keep going, and Kadcyla made it possible for me.”\nMary Creagh (Wakefield) (Lab)\nI congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. She certainly makes a powerful speech on behalf of her friend. Does she agree that when NICE looks at the cost-value ratio, stories such as that of her friend, who kept eight people in work, should also be a factor? We should be looking at women’s economic life and economic role, in both the workplace and the home.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nI completely agree with my hon. Friend. I appreciate that the equations and calculations are difficult, and I do not underestimate NICE’s work, but it is about life and quality of life, and it is about so many more people than only those who have the cancer.\nMy friend Leslie said:\n“In 2013 my world was turned upside down when I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer, a rare and aggressive kind of cancer that develops in the lymph vessels.\nAfter 15 months’ treatment comprising 8 chemotherapy treatments, a mastectomy, 15 radiotherapy treatments and a year of Herceptin, it appeared that the cancer had gone. However, 4 months later I noticed a rash around the scar tissue of the mastectomy and a biopsy showed that the cancer had recurred in my skin.\nMy oncologist told me that I was in a very tight corner. Because the cancer had returned so quickly I wasn’t eligible for the usual drug treatments, radiotherapy wasn’t an option because I had recently completed a course, and surgery wasn’t possible because of the location of the cancer. I was told the cancer was incurable and referred to the Royal Marsden. They confirmed that surgery was not feasible because the cancer had spread so quickly over a large area making skin grafts impossible. I was told Kadcyla was my best chance.\nI have now been treated with Kadcyla for 22 months and I have been told of others that have been treated for 5 years. Signs of the cancer disappeared very quickly and so far I have remained cancer free. Kadcyla has enabled me to live a reasonably normal life and participate in and contribute to my local community. Kadcyla has been a life saver for me and without it my future was very uncertain. I feel profoundly fortunate to have received it and I am incredulous that such an effective drug will now be denied to other people in my situation.”\nI also want to share the story of Adele Hipwell from Plymouth, who emailed me yesterday to say:\n‘I am 46 years old and have 2 children and 2 step sons. I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in March last year. By the time of my diagnosis the cancer had already spread to my spine, meaning it is now incurable.\nThe oncologist has prescribed herceptin and petumazab, and reassured me if these drugs stop working then we can try an effective alternative, Kadcyla.\nKadcyla would offer me precious quality of time with my family. My husband sadly passed away 5 years\nago – and my diagnosis is yet another cruel blow.\nI am not just a statistic. My children are dependent on me. They are relying on me being around.\nI find the decision cruel and unfair to women in my situation, because we are an easy target. Could you imagine the outrage if the NHS stopped hip or knee replacements for the elderly, claiming it was longer ‘cost effective’?\nWhy bother with cancer screening programmes and cancer research if the powers that be feel they can save money by cutting short our lives?'\nI also wish to mention Rosalie, who was featured in Friday’s Evening Standard. She is just 33 and is living with incurable breast cancer. She is a single parent to two children, aged three and six, and is terrified of a future without the option of Kadcyla and terrified of her kids’ growing up alone. These are Rosalie’s own words:\n“I hate feeling like a victim. But I have to fight for my kids. They are more important than me feeling vulnerable about going public. I have to fight for life for them.”\nThen there is Mani. Members may have seen her last week on the “Victoria Derbyshire” programme when she spoke so eloquently about how Kadcyla had given her hope. She said that it had improved her life both significantly and quickly, enabling her to live a much fuller and richer life, going on holiday and playing an active part in her young daughter’s life.\nThese are just a few of the many women whose lives have been made possible through access to Kadcyla. I am sure that many hon. Members will share the experiences of their constituents. The hon. Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp) will no doubt talk about the incredible Bonnie Fox, the face of the Keep Kadcyla campaign of Breast Cancer Now. Thanks to the hard work of Bonnie and of Breast Cancer Now, this campaign has seen more than 100,000 people sign the petition, calling for NICE and Roche to come together to reassess the decision and find a solution to keep Kadcyla available.\nBonnie is an incredible advocate for the Keep Kadcyla campaign, inspiring so many others as she leads the case for this treatment. Bonnie says that her inspiration comes from wanting to have as much time as possible with her two-year-old son, Barnaby. These are her own words:\n“I already feel cheated being diagnosed with secondary breast cancer at 37 with a baby, so having a drug taken away that would potentially add years to my life and give me more quality time with my son is so cruel.”\nNorman Lamb\nI am really grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way again. She will be aware that the Government’s accelerated access review last October recommended that NICE should review its whole health technology assessment processes and methods. Is she concerned that the review of Kadcyla and other drugs under the cancer drugs fund is happening before that review takes place? We might learn the lessons about how the review process needs to improve, but we will not benefit from them.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nI agree with the right hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he knows more about this process than I do. It clearly makes sense to consider these unique, unusual first-tier drugs in the light of that reconsideration.\nI hope that we will hear the stories of the many women whose lives, having been affected by secondary breast cancer, have been enriched by Kadcyla. The drug Kadcyla matters so much to all these women for one simple reason: it works. It is effective. It has already been available on the NHS for more than two years and, compared with other treatments, its side effects are limited. Today, it is nothing short of a tragedy to know that countless women who thought that Kadcyla would be the next treatment they would receive for their breast cancer are having their lives shortened before their eyes.\nI ask Members to imagine this: they are living with breast cancer; there is no cure, but there is something that could give them extra time with the people they love—the people who depend on them. It could be a year, five years or even longer. If they needed the drug today, the NHS would give it to them, but if they needed it in a few months’ time, they may have lost their chance.\nDr Rupa Huq (Ealing Central and Acton) (Lab)\nMy hon. Friend is making a very powerful speech. May I congratulate her on securing this debate, and say how proud I am to be a co-signatory? The phenomenon of there being drugs in the pipeline that would make a vital difference to patients, but which are being held up by conflict between NICE and pharmaceutical companies over pricing or value for money, applies not only to breast cancer but to other cancers, too. My constituent David Innes is one of 20,000 sufferers of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. He was diagnosed in 2009, when he was 39. He was in Parliament earlier this week, making the same argument, and saying that both parties need to end the logjam and come up with a deal to ensure the availability of these drugs. They need to put patients first. Life is too short not to do so.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nI completely agree with my hon. Friend. I wish her constituent, David, all the best.\nHow can we withdraw a drug from the NHS that is working, especially when we are offering nothing in its place? It seems senseless to me, and it is truly devastating to those for whom it really matters. Of course, as my hon. Friend says, Kadcyla is just one drug that we need to look at. What will happen with other key breast cancer drugs now and in the future? I wish to consider just two more examples. Perjeta is currently available through the cancer drugs fund, but unlike Kadcyla it has not yet been re-appraised, although it will be soon. Perjeta is used for HER2 positive secondary breast cancer patients. In many ways it is even more effective than Kadcyla, as it enables women to live for an additional six months without their breast cancer progressing, and can extend life by an additional six months or more. However, because it is administered with two other drugs—Herceptin and Docetaxel—it would not be considered cost-effective under NICE standards even if the drug manufacturer gave it away for free.\nThe other drug is Palbociclib, which is used on women with hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer. It is a new drug, which is being assessed for the first time by NICE. It is extremely effective and enables women to live for at least an additional 10 months without their breast cancer progressing. However, because women are living longer, robust overall survival data are not yet available. Perversely, that will count against it in the NICE appraisal. Overall survival data are given greater weight than progression-free survival in NICE appraisals, despite the fact that the outcome is the same—a longer, more enriched life.\nWe are seeing effective treatment after effective treatment being rejected or facing rejection by NICE. I want to know this: is it really right that we have a health service that plans to take away those lifelines? How is the decision to take away these life-extending drugs beneficial for people living with cancer, or for any of us who might one day need access to them? Who makes these decisions, and how can we be sure that they are the right ones?\nWe have a drug appraisal process, which is certainly valuable and necessary, but I question the factors that constitute that process. It is too easy to assume that the experts must automatically be right. The process is: numbers in, formula used, then a yes or no answer. Let us not forget that we are talking about people’s lives. The lives of those affected and those for whom this decision is all too real are in the hands of a formula—the NICE appraisal process—and yet this life-changing formula has had little examination for many years. How many of us actually understand what factors are taken into account in these life-or-death decisions?\nThe drug Palbociclib is proving so effective that, at present, it only has data on how long people are living without their breast cancer progressing.\nJulie Elliott (Sunderland Central) (Lab)\nDoes my hon. Friend agree that the fact that that drug is routinely available in France, Germany, Austria and Canada shows that our appraisal system is not working in this country.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nI agree with my hon. Friend. It is amazing to think that, for this particular drug, it will take longer to get overall survival data because people are living longer without their cancer spreading. That obvious success is seen as a big disadvantage in the NICE appraisal system. The cost of Palbociclib will appear to be much higher in the NICE formula because overall survival data are given much more weight than progression-free survival. That seems illogical to me.\nConsider also the criteria for determining end-of-life treatment. If a treatment is end-of-life, it is allowed double the quality-adjusted life year costings of other drugs. End-of-life is considered to be two years, but why not three? How have we ended up with such an arbitrary, fixed figure, especially when the figure in Scotland is three years? There is no cure for secondary breast cancer, but as people start to live longer it will place them at a disadvantage when accessing treatments, because it will be harder for those treatments to become approved, as they are no longer considered under the end-of-life criteria.\nTherefore, how can the Minister be sure that the NICE process is still fit for purpose? Will she respond specifically on two suggestions: first, to review the weighting for progression-free survival when overall survival is not available because a treatment is so effective; and secondly, to change the criteria for end-of-life treatment to three years’ survival instead of two?\nI want to return to the issue of off-patent treatments. In recent years there have been two private Members’ Bills on the topic, one of which was introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds). We heard many commitments from the then Minister for Life Sciences, but we have not yet seen any improvement in access, which is hugely disappointing. The Minister committed to establishing a working group to investigate what could be done to enable routine use of such treatments. I believe that the working group is due to conclude its work next month and publish its report. Will the report introduce a clear pathway for off-patent treatments, will the Minister write to me with the details of the pathway and state explicitly how it will work for bisphosphonate drugs for the prevention of secondary breast cancer?\nBreast Cancer Now and others have been disappointed by the extremely patchy availability of this treatment for eligible women. As a result, it recently launched the “43p a day” campaign to highlight the low cost of the treatment and the fact that it would save over 1,000 lives every year in the UK if it was routinely available, not to mention millions of pounds for the NHS.\nChris Philp (Croydon South) (Con)\nI congratulate the hon. Lady on securing the debate. I want to put on the record my support for the case she is making and draw the House’s attention to the case of my constituency Bonnie Fox—she is in the Gallery today—who is suffering in the way the hon. Lady has described, and whose life chances would be greatly improved if something more could be done to preserve the availability of Kadcyla. I once again express my support for the case the hon. Lady is so eloquently making.\nSiobhain McDonagh\nI thank the hon. Gentleman. He is very lucky to have a constituent as exceptional as Bonnie Fox, who has already been mentioned because of all her work.\nAs a result of Breast Cancer Now’s campaign, the Minister has said that clinical commissioning groups are responsible for commissioning the treatment for bisphosphonates. What contact has been made with CCGs on the use of this treatment in these circumstances? As I understand it, the treatment presents a challenge to existing commissioning arrangements because it does not fit squarely into either specialised services, which are commissioned by NHS England, or local commissioning by CCGs. Does the Minister agree that if we want genuine progress on the availability of this treatment, we cannot take the path of least resistance and just say, “It’s up to CCGs; CCGs are independent bodies and can make their own decisions.” That is the “do nothing” option.\nTreatments do not always fit into the neat categories that we create. This is an old treatment that requires a new approach. It requires our commissioning strategists at NHS England to make a considered decision about how to commission the treatment routinely. Will the Minister agree to meet Ian Dodge, the national director for commissioning strategy, to discuss this specific case with him and to keep Members here today updated on those discussions? Will she also agree that it is indeed worrying that a treatment that could prevent over 1,000 women getting secondary breast cancer every year is not routinely available?\nFinally—I think that everybody will be delighted that I am about to finish—I hope that the Minister will consider meeting some of the women affected by the decision on Kadcyla and the women from Breast Cancer Now who are here today. I would like to thank those women in the Public Gallery for coming here to show their support for this debate en masse. I wish every single one of them well. Access to life-enhancing and life-saving drugs should be a right in the UK, not a decision based on a lottery of access to private healthcare. I sincerely hope that NICE will reverse its decision and give every woman with secondary breast cancer their future back.\n14:25:00\nIain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con)\nI congratulate the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing this important debate and setting out her case so powerfully. I agree with pretty much everything she said. I know that several Members wish to speak, so I will not detain the House by simply repeating all those points.\nMy motivation in speaking today comes from a meeting I had at my constituency surgery just a few weeks ago with my constituent Joanna Mears and her husband. Like many other sufferers, they are watching our proceedings from the Public Gallery. Mrs Mears suffers from secondary breast cancer. Although, sadly, her condition is terminal, she is responding well to her existing medication and has already had more than twice the expected benefit span. When the point comes that the medication no longer has that effect, her only remaining option will be Kadcyla. Naturally, she is very concerned about NICE’s decision.\nSir Desmond Swayne\nThis is essentially the same question I asked earlier. I think that we all accept that a mistake has been made and that the decision was wrong. The key question is this: what is the remedy? Does the remedy lie within NICE’s remit, and therefore it could change its procedures and considerations, or does it lie within the statutory framework that Parliament and Government have set for it to work within? We have to come to an answer on that.\nIain Stewart\nI am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that question. My answer is pretty much the same as that of the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden. In this specific case, I hope that there is scope for NICE and Roche, the manufacturer of Kadcyla, to sit down and agree some compromise. I received a briefing note from Roche this morning stating that it was willing to do that, so I hope that NICE will respond in kind. Its consultation ended last week. As the hon. Lady said, and as my right hon. Friend rightly points out, there is a broader issue for other drugs. Perhaps it is time to look again at the appraisal system and the cost mechanisms so that we do not keep returning to this debate every time a new drug is identified and there is a question about its affordability under the cancer drugs fund.\nMr Jim Cunningham (Coventry South) (Lab)\nI agree, because it is not only about the drugs we are debating today; we have had problems before in relation to NICE. In answer to the question from the right hon. Member for New Forest West (Sir Desmond Swayne), I think that the Minister should look at the procedures and at NICE itself, because otherwise we will keep coming back to this issue time and again. The years I have spent listening to the same issues with different drugs is nobody’s business, to use an expression.\nIain Stewart\nThe hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I do not pretend to be an expert on how NICE works, but I hope to bring to the debate the personal experience of my constituent and underline the human effect of these issues. I do not necessarily have a solution, but I hope that the outcome of the debate will be that we not only consider Kadcyla, but take a fresh look at the whole process.\nMary Creagh\nThe NICE framework works very well for mass drugs for the entire population or where a whole vaccination is going to work, but for very small numbers of people, such as the 1,200 women who really need this drug, I do not think it is as effective a process. There are two organisations in this negotiation, NICE and Roche, and we must not have Roche seeing its new drugs Perjeta and Kadcyla as a new cash cow as Herceptin goes off-patent in 2017-18. Women’s lives should not be treated as cash cows by this drugs company.\nIain Stewart\nI agree with the hon. Lady. I have not had any personal discussions with Roche; I can only refer to and take at face value the briefing note that it sent me early this morning, which seemed to represent a genuine wish to negotiate with NICE and get the drug down to an acceptable price. I hope the debate is joined in that spirit.\nPerhaps it is appropriate to mention now something I was going to bring up later in my speech: one area that needs to be examined is the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, which is a five-year voluntary contract between the pharmaceutical companies and NICE. If I understand how it is intended to work, the pharmaceutical companies will underwrite any overspend for a particular drug. For various reasons that does not seem to be working in practice. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to look at that point, which has been made by some in the industry.\nIn the case of my constituent, Mrs Mears, when her current medication ceases to be effective, Kadcyla is the only option. Although she has responded well to the current treatment, there is every likelihood, and her consultant agrees, that she will respond in a similarly positive way to Kadcyla. There is every chance that she would enjoy the benefits of that drug for a time well in excess of the expected nine months. I would therefore argue that a blanket ban on the drug would be inappropriate. At the very least, there should be some flexibility in the system to make the drug available to people such as my constituent, for whom there is a very high probability that it would have more than the expected benefit. She has responded so well to her existing drug, and if her life could be extended considerably by Kadcyla, that would allow more research to be done on the efficacy of her existing medication, which would be an important body of evidence to add to the appraisal process.\nThe hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden rightly said that the prescription of drugs should be based solely on clinical need and no other factor, but when I met Mrs Mears, she made one point to me that I could not really answer. Through her life, she worked professionally in the criminal justice system and has done a lot of work saving the public purse money by innovating programmes to reduce youth offending. That value cannot be calculated, but she made the point to me, “At the one point in my life that I need something back from this country, it is being denied to me.” I really could not give an answer to that. I hope that something can be done to make the drug available.\nThe NICE decision is provisional. I contributed to the consultation and I hope that when NICE meets next—in, I think, early March—it will review the decision.\nI know that NHS resources are finite and that there are many competing demands on its budget. The debate on the overall size of the NHS budget must be a matter for another time, but cases such as this illustrate the need to use what resources we have as efficiently as possible. Just before I met Mrs Mears the other week, I happened to see a story in the media that really made my blood boil. I do not pretend to be an expert in the prescription system, but I simply put this on the table. The story reported that the NHS wastes about £80 million per annum by prescribing simple painkillers such as paracetamol, which can be bought in a supermarket for 20p or 30p a packet. Those prescriptions go through the usual prescription system and cost £80 million a year. Surely there is a way of getting around that, somehow to give GP practices a stock of basic painkillers. I am not asking for people who get free prescriptions to start paying but, surely, there is a way for doctors to issue them when it is appropriate to do so, and stop this merry-go-round of paperwork that costs many millions of pounds.\nMrs Sharon Hodgson (Washington and Sunderland West) (Lab)\nThe hon. Gentleman is making a very valuable point. Does he agree that one way around this issue would be to have prescribing pharmacists who could give out medications such as those basic painkillers, without the need for the patient even to see their GP, which would also free up valuable GP time?\nIain Stewart\nThat sounds an eminently sensible suggestion. As I say, I do not pretend to be an expert on the system, but, surely, something like that could be done. Then the money saved could be added to the cancer drugs fund and make more drugs such as Kadcyla available to people who need them.\nI will end my comments, as I know there are many Members who want to contribute. Please let us try to do everything we can in this House to encourage NICE and Roche to look at the overall system and to look in particular at this drug. It means so much to my constituent and to many others up and down the country. I hope that this debate has that effect. I conclude where I started, by congratulating the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden on securing it.\n14:36:00\nNick Thomas-Symonds (Torfaen) (Lab)\nI begin by thanking the Backbench Business Committee for selecting this very important topic for debate this afternoon. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) for the passionate but very thoughtful way in which she introduced the debate. I endorse everything that she said. On the drug Kadcyla, she said, quite pithily, that, first, it works and, secondly, it has far fewer side effects than many other cancer drugs. I was also very proud to have backed the 43p-a-day campaign that she mentioned.\nI declare an interest as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on off-patent drugs and should also say that one of my first actions as a Member of this House in 2015 was to become a breast cancer ambassador. I was very proud to do that, as the person who inspired me to come into politics, my grandmother, died of the disease some years ago.\nI was lucky enough in my early months in this House to be drawn in the ballot for a private Member’s Bill. I introduced the Off-patent Drugs Bill, and although it was talked out in quite controversial circumstances on 6 November 2015, I was none the less pleased after that to work on a cross-party basis to achieve legislative progress. I pay tribute to the hon. Members for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford), for Bury St Edmunds (Jo Churchill) and for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris), and to the former Minister for Life Sciences, the hon. Member for Mid Norfolk (George Freeman), for the work that was done in those months to make legislative changes which were incorporated in the Access to Medical Treatments (Innovation) Bill, which became an Act and received Royal Assent in March last year.\nI want to come to the pledges that were made on 29 January 2016 and how things have moved forward since. I say to the Minister that in setting out a number of questions about this matter, I do not necessarily expect them all to be answered in detail in her closing remarks. If there are aspects that she feels she cannot answer in detail, I would be grateful if she wrote to me about them after the debate.\nOn 29 January 2016, I and others in the House tabled a package of amendments to the Access to Medical Treatments (Innovation) Bill. Some were substantial and went into the Bill. Others were probing amendments designed to extract the promises that I have talked about. The then Minister for Life Sciences said:\n“Broadly, the intention of the package of amendments is to introduce off-label repurposed medicines in the Bill, and to put it four square at the heart of the agenda.”\nThat is precisely what we sought to do that day. He added:\n“I wholeheartedly supported the intention of his Bill and its predecessor, but not the mechanism. We now have a mechanism that will work”—\nwe had spoken that day about the mechanism.\nOne of the amendments requested an action plan, but the Minister decided he did not want that on the face of the Bill. However, he said:\n“let me set out my commitment and that of the Government to pursuing this agenda with time and rigour.” —[Official Report, 29 January 2016; Vol. 605, c. 543.]\nDr Huq\nI remember very well my hon. Friend’s Bill and the shameful way it was talked out by the professional filibusterers on the Government Benches. However, does he not agree that any action plan needs to look at these things in the round? It should look at the poor post-diagnosis support and information that patients get across other types of cancer, not just breast cancer. It should also look at the limited availability of the effective drugs we have talked about, which do not have side effects, and at the fact that drugs have been de-listed from the Cancer Drugs Fund.\nNick Thomas-Symonds\nI certainly agree that the pathway has to be comprehensive, and I will come back to it in a moment.\nIn addition that day, the then Minister for life sciences said he would\n“explore mechanisms for ensuring NICE can look at evidence and develop evidence-based guidance on off-label medicines, so that doctors are aware of which drugs are being used in an off-label indication…NICE is now looking at ways to collect evidence on repurposed medicines.”\nHe spoke about the “British National Formulary”, and I am pleased about the progress that has been made on it, which I will come back to in a moment.\nWe proposed—this would have applied to NHS England—that there should be a new system of national commissioning for repurposed drugs. Again, our amendment was not accepted, but this pledge was given:\n“The NHS is hungry to look at all options for promoting off-label and repurposed drug use.” —[Official Report, 29 January 2016; Vol. 605, c. 544-45.]\nI hope that that pledge can be repeated by the Minister at the Dispatch Box today. There was also a commitment to consult all relevant stakeholders. Again, I would hope that that is fairly uncontroversial and can be repeated.\nLet me come now to where we have got to. When I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden, I quoted the worrying statistic about bisphosphonates, which really do provide a case in point. They are used to treat osteoporosis, but they are very effective in their secondary form—the repurposed form—where someone has primary breast cancer, and they certainly help to prevent that from spreading to the bone. The statistic that only 24% of clinicians are prescribing bisphosphonates is very worrying, and it does need to be addressed, because there should be no barrier in the system to their being far more widely prescribed than they are.\nLet me come to the working group. I understand that it will conclude at the end of next month. I am very grateful for the fact that I will be meeting officials from the Pharmacy and Medicines Directorate in the next few weeks to discuss this issue. However, if there is to be a pathway, I would appreciate it if the Minister was prepared to share it with me in draft form before that meeting, so that comments could be made on it, particularly going back to the pledges made last year.\nThe “British National Formulary” has begun work. Indeed, I looked up bisphosphonates specifically on BNF Online before I came to the debate. What makes the 24% statistic even more worrying is that BNF Online says:\n“The use of bisphosphonates in patients with metastatic breast cancer may reduce pain and prevent skeletal complications of bone metastases.”\nThat is there already—it is in the prescriber’s bible, if you like—so the Minister really should focus on why it is not filtering through the system in the way that it should.\nIn addition, there is a pilot licensing scheme that brings together medical research charities and generics manufacturers to license off-patent drugs for their new purposes. If the Minister could comment on whether she is looking for that to become a fully fledged scheme, that would be helpful.\nThe scheme is an interesting development, because my Bill, in its original form, would actually have put a duty on the Secretary of State for Health to seek licences for drugs in their new indications, and that was the bone of contention between me and the then Minister, who thought that it was too onerous for the Secretary of State to have that duty.\nLooking back at that debate, I think the other interesting thing is that a point was made about the EU’s licensing scheme. It was said that any changes could run a coach and horses through that scheme, but given that we will not be members of the European Union by the end of this Parliament, I would be interested to hear how the Minister thinks the end of the Brexit process will affect this issue. If the European licensing scheme was seen by the Minister at the time as posing something of a problem, perhaps she can tell us if she will consider whether the pilot licensing scheme can now become fully fledged and how she see things developing here in the UK without the European scheme.\nI appreciate that I have put a lot of points to the Minister. As I said, I am perfectly happy for her to write to me about them. However, we should not forget the difference that this off-patent drugs agenda can make to people’s lives. Those who face this disease show incredible bravery. For example, we have my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol West (Thangam Debbonaire) in the Chamber with us, and Bonnie Fox, a constituent of the hon. Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp), is in the Public Gallery. We in this House, as legislators, owe a duty to all who suffer from this terrible disease to take all possible steps to make what are extraordinarily cheap drugs as readily available throughout our country as possible.\n14:46:00\nMrs Flick Drummond (Portsmouth South) (Con)\nIt is a pleasure to speak in the debate, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing it. I was really honoured to be able to back the application to the Backbench Business Committee. I also thank her for her powerful speech, which was very moving.\nFighting cancer is not just a top priority for the NHS but one of the great scientific challenges of our time. Treating our illnesses with science rather than superstition is a relatively new idea in the history of medicine. However, the acceleration of better diagnosis, better treatment and more successful outcomes is keeping more of us alive for longer, and with a better quality of life.\nThe motion mentions Kadcyla, a treatment that NICE is not currently able to recommend for the treatment of secondary breast cancer, and we await the result of its consultation in March. This treatment is a relative of another medicine, which, in its introduction, was also extremely controversial—Herceptin. After a lot of consideration by NICE and a lot of debate and pressure from this House, Herceptin was approved. It has helped thousands of people—men get breast cancer too—in fighting breast cancer.\nKadcyla is a treatment that could help women who have already been on an Herceptin-based treatment and whose cancer has continued to advance. We must be clear when we talk about secondary, or metastatic, cancer that we are talking about people whose lives will be massively shortened by cancer. Kadcyla gives them and their families more time and a better quality of life. It can add months to the life expectancy of patients whose remaining lives are likely to be measured in only a few months. The hon. Lady movingly talked about some of her friends and some of those in the Public Gallery.\nI think we all understand that there are ultimate financial constraints on the NHS, even though spending on it has increased. I really welcome the new cancer drugs fund, which provides patients with much better access to the most promising new cancer treatments, while providing value for the taxpayer.\nMrs Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet) (Con)\nI was profoundly moved by the case of my constituent, Rosalie Marshall, who sadly is suffering from breast cancer. She told me that she finds it hard to understand why the NHS can spend such significant sums on conditions which, frankly, are not life-threatening and sometimes seem to verge on the cosmetic, and yet not give priority to vital drugs like Kadcyla. Surely something is wrong, and savings could be made in other parts of the NHS that would more than pay for Kadcyla.\nMrs Drummond\nYes, I also get emails on the same subject. We have to remember, though, that there are other considerations such as mental health conditions. Sometimes people do not quite understand why money is being spent on various parts of the NHS, but there are always other reasons behind it. However, I totally agree with my right hon. Friend about drugs like this which seem to make such a difference.\nIn the case of Kadcyla, there do seem to be questions as to why it cannot be brought into regular use. Some of those questions are for NICE and some are for the manufacturer. Kadcyla is a treatment that has been accepted by a number of European countries, despite the expense. I am reassured to see that many cancer charities accept that NICE has made every effort so far to fund it, and that NICE has been doing its best. However, there remains the question of how NICE’s apparent final position stands up by comparison with other European countries—France and Germany, for instance. France’s equivalent of NICE considered Kadcyla in exactly the same way as NICE has, and has approved it.\nAnother query is based on the choice of comparator treatment in assessing the quality of Kadcyla as a treatment. There have been concerns that the comparator treatment—Lapatinib and Capecitebine; I hope that Hansard will be able to report that rather better than I can say it—is no longer available on the NHS. The drug’s manufacturer carries the comparison on its own website, with the outcome of a clinical trial codenamed EMILIA. However, it does not seem realistic to base a decision on a drug on a comparison with another drug that is not available on the NHS either. It would help everyone to understand the comparison if it was made with a drug that is generally available.\nCan the Minister tell us the status of Roche’s study under the name, ESTHER, which is looking at Kadcyla? In the event that NICE does not revise its decision now, will it be open to it to do so when it gets the ESTHER conclusions? That trial is not scheduled to report until 2023, so the immediate concerns about availability remain. However, I recognise that research goes on constantly, and that perhaps the manufacturer will reconsider its position. It is unfortunate that NICE has been subjected to the sustained attacks by the manufacturer, Roche, which has risked undermining NICE’s reputation in a most unjustified way. I call on Roche to get round the table with NICE and look again at the pricing of this drug, as it has done with others in the past.\nTurning to other treatments, I know that the message is going out to clinical commissioning groups about the options available. Many Members will have had campaign emails relating to bisphosphonates, and I was reassured by the response I had from the Department of Health and the Portsmouth clinical commissioning group that they are being made available. Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth has above-average performance in both treatment times and outcomes, and is becoming, if it is not already, a centre of excellence in cancer treatment.\nI know that this is a difficult subject and budgets are limited, but like many others in this House, including those in the Gallery, many of my friends and family have died of breast cancer or are survivors. We need to make sure that we are keeping up with the right drugs to treat them, and that sounds like Kadcyla.\n14:52:00\nMike Kane (Wythenshawe and Sale East) (Lab)\nI congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing this debate. She made an extraordinarily powerful and emotive speech. I join her in wishing everybody who is here today in the Public Gallery and everybody who is watching this debate at home all the very best for the future. It is also a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart), who made a very powerful speech citing the personal testimony of his constituent, whose case he argued eloquently. My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds) spoke eloquently about his grandmother being his inspiration for going into politics, and her dying of the disease. We come into politics for many different reasons, the profession of public pain being one. Nye Bevan did not create the NHS in 1948; he created it much earlier when his father died of pneumoconiosis in his arms before the time of the NHS. I hope that I can pronounce the drugs that I am going to mention just as well as the hon. Member for Portsmouth South (Mrs Drummond) did.\nWe have heard lots of statistics today. Stats, in themselves, are shocking, and it is also important to remind ourselves that behind every statistic there is a human story. The lives of women, all too often young women and mothers, are being cut cruelly short. We have heard many important interventions about access to breast cancer drugs for treatment of secondary breast cancer. At the heart of the motion is also the issue of how we can improve access to innovative new breast cancer drugs and off-patent drugs used for breast cancer. The use of such drugs relates not only to the treatment of breast cancer but to its prevention. I am immensely proud of the fact that my constituency is home to the Nightingale centre— Europe’s first breast cancer prevention centre—and the charity Prevent Breast Cancer. I am a Mancunian MP, so my constituency also benefits from close proximity to the Christie hospital, the largest single-site cancer centre in Europe, treating more than 44,000 patients a year.\nThe Nightingale centre opened at University Hospital of South Manchester—Wythenshawe hospital—in July 2007. It offers state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment services to women and men with breast cancer and co-ordinates the NHS breast screening programme for the entire Greater Manchester area. It also provides training facilities aimed at addressing the shortage of breast cancer specialists, and it houses many of the Prevent Breast Cancer researchers who are looking at ways to predict and prevent breast cancer.\nIn the Prevent Breast Cancer research unit, several drugs that are now out of patent are being repurposed for preventing cancer from coming back. Women with a family history or other factors that make them high risk are known to benefit from these drugs, which prevent the disease. But women in that position find it difficult to obtain these inexpensive, tried-and-tested drugs because they are currently not listed in the “British National Formulary” as specifically licensed for the new purpose of prevention, despite successful clinical trials. There are currently three drugs in that situation: Tamoxifen, Raloxifene and Anastrozole.\nNick Thomas-Symonds\nWill my hon. Friend give way?\nMike Kane\nI would be happy to give way, having got the names of those drugs right.\nNick Thomas-Symonds\nI understand that a new policy is being put together by those in charge of the “British National Formulary”, which will set out how they will get more off-label drugs into the formulary. Does my hon. Friend agree that the sooner that policy is available for us to see the better?\nMike Kane\nI congratulate my hon. Friend on doing so much work in this area since he came to Parliament. We can only hope that what he says is true; perhaps the Minister can give us more information on that point in her summing up.\nThe Prevent Breast Cancer research unit has more out-of-patent drugs under investigation for breast cancer prevention which may be even better for the future. As well as doing everything we can to extend the life of women with secondary breast cancer, we must do all we can to prevent breast cancer from occurring in the first place. As we all know, the adage is that prevention is better than cure. For those with secondary cancer, for whom cure is currently out of reach, many people will be striving to achieve that for the next generation.\nAt the moment, the system is standing in the way. A solution to make those drugs more widely available that would cost very little money indeed would be to ask NICE to list such drugs as approved for the new indication of prevention in the “British National Formulary”—following the evaluation of relevant clinical trials, of course—so that doctors can have confidence in prescribing them. The requirement to obtain a new Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency licence for the new indication is expensive and impractical for repurposed medications, because they usually lack a sponsoring pharmaceutical company to champion the new use of the generic drug. I am sure the Minister would agree that such a small change would be transformative in the prevention of breast cancer. I hope that she will ask NICE to consider that change to the way in which drugs are listed in the “British National Formulary”, to allow drugs that have been evaluated for a new purpose, such as prevention, to be listed as approved for that purpose.\nWhen we lose someone prematurely to cancer, grief obviously follows. It has been my experience that when we lose someone to breast cancer, the grief is particularly poignant. Tonight, my thoughts and prayers will be with all my constituents who have either succumbed to the disease or are battling it, and with their families who carry the consequences. I lost my cousin Maura Kane to the disease, and my two friends Tom and Claire both lost their mothers to it. I stand in solidarity with my constituent and friend Sheila Higgins, who is battling this disease. She has been like a mother to me for the last two decades. Finally, my parliamentary assistant Suzanne Richards came back to work after Christmas with a clean bill of health. She was diagnosed with a virulent strain last year, but she had world-class treatment at the Wythenshawe and Christie hospitals. Today is her birthday, but it is a birthday that many of us feared she would never see—happy birthday, Suzanne.\n15:00:00\nVictoria Atkins (Louth and Horncastle) (Con)\nI thank the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) for securing this debate. It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane). I am sure everyone in the House wishes his assistant a very happy and fulfilling birthday, and many more to come.\nSadly, most families in this country have had some experience of cancer at some point, and we have heard of many compelling examples today. As we debate the difficult topic of the provision of medicines to those who need them, I am very conscious that discussions about prices and the costs of drugs mean nothing, frankly, to the wives, daughters, mothers and grandmothers who simply want to live for the next week, the next month or the next year to see their next birthday or the birthday of a loved one.\nI do not underestimate the task facing NICE, but having listened to the speeches today, we must ask why countries such as France and Germany have approved this drug, when NICE drew the initial conclusion it did at the end of last year. I know that the Minister is listening carefully, and I hope that our questions and thoughts on this process will feed into a larger review of how NICE looks at this and other drugs, and of whether the process is as correct and appropriate as it should be. I am a big believer in saying that any system run by human beings can always be made better, and I wonder whether this is such an example.\nI want to look at Lincolnshire, the county in which my constituency is situated. I am pleased that we have better than average cancer screening in the county. What worries me, however, is that when it comes to diagnosing the early signs of breast cancer, my local clinical commissioning group ranks third from the bottom in the United Kingdom. That is very significant because, as we all know in this House and beyond it, the earlier the diagnosis of cancer, whether first stage or secondary, the better the chances of successful treatment.\nThe treatment of secondary breast cancer is particularly relevant to my constituency. I have met representatives from Breast Cancer Care—I say “representatives”, but they are women, mums and wives—and I was incredibly moved to hear the stories of their experiences of living with secondary breast cancer. I commend the vital work that the charity has done, particularly its “Secondary, not second-rate” campaign looking at the barriers preventing the improvement of care for those with secondary breast cancer.\nBreast Cancer Care highlighted to me the key point that unless our hospital trusts collect specific data on how many people have been diagnosed with secondary breast cancer, they cannot accurately plan services for those patients. I was shocked to learn that two thirds of hospital trusts in this country do not collect those data. Sadly, my hospital trust—the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust—is one of those trusts. I urge my hospital trust and others across the country to start to collect those data, so that the services provided to women with secondary breast cancer can be planned properly and effectively.\nThe Minister will want to tell the House about the success of the cancer drugs fund. We know that 95,000 people have received the life-extending drugs they need through the fund. However, we must always strive to look at new ways of making sure that patients have access to innovative new medicines, diagnostics and medical technologies, as is happening through the accelerated access review plans.\nI also welcome the Government’s commitment to making sure that the prices charged to the NHS are fair and not inflated. I cannot be the only Member who was shocked and pretty disgusted by some of the headlines that have appeared in newspapers recently about the conduct of some companies in massively inflating the price of patent drugs. I am pleased that that loophole will be closed by the Health Service Medical Supplies (Costs) Bill, which is currently in the other place. I urge the Secretary of State to ensure, as I know he is doing, that the Competition and Markets Authority keeps a close eye on the matter. Unfair practices should not conspire against our constituents, neighbours, friends and families when it comes to cancer treatment.\nI know that my hon. Friend the Minister has listened carefully to the concerns raised in this informative and engaging debate. I hope that a solution is reached quickly between NICE and Roche if the problem is that the price charged for the drug is simply too high. I join other Members in wishing every single woman in this country who is battling first stage or secondary cancer the very best of luck. I hope those women feel that the debate has done them proud.\n15:06:00\nMr Steve Baker (Wycombe) (Con)\nI congratulate the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing the debate. Like other hon. Members, I am here today to represent my constituents’ concerns. I should say from the off that I join the cause to make Kadcyla more available.\nWhen my staff and I were discussing the correspondence about the debate and particular constituency cases, we quickly agreed that this is the worst sort of correspondence that we receive—when people are terminally ill but unable to access the medicines that they need. The subject is particularly acute—I do not think that I am the first Member to struggle to keep a quaver out of my voice—because my mother-in-law died of secondary cancer. These things will stay with us all. None of us can know what ladies who are currently suffering from these diseases are going through, but when we have seen it at second hand, we all want to live in a world where the NHS does not have to practise any rationing.\nI want to focus on that point because, as the hon. Member for Coventry South (Mr Cunningham) said, the problem is intractable. I know about some of the great difficulties in bringing forward Abiraterone to help men, in a similar set of circumstances, suffering from prostate cancer. In a sense, I sympathise with the Minister and with NICE because they have an extremely difficult task. While it is easy for all of us to say that of course Kadcyla should be freely available to all those who need it without restriction, I am well aware that the problem is long-standing and applies to many innovative pharmaceuticals.\nI also appreciate that it is no comfort whatever to sufferers of various cancers to know that a profit-making pharmaceutical system has a far better record of innovation than the alternative planned systems. I wish the Minister every success in her crucial task of working out how to ensure that innovative medicines come forward at a lower cost and a greater rate.\n15:08:00\nMartyn Day (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (SNP)\nIt is a pleasure to take part in today’s important debate and I thank the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) for securing it. I am grateful to her for her contribution and the cases that she used to illustrate it. She eloquently put a human face to the problem.\nThe debate about access to Kadcyla and other breast cancer drugs is of immense interest to the public on both sides of the border. Breast cancer is the most common cancer, which was shown by the many individual constituency cases cited by hon. Members of all parties today.\nAs has been said, Kadcyla is an effective life-extending treatment, which gives some women with incurable secondary breast cancer up to nine months longer than the alternatives, and has fewer side effects and a cost of around £90,000 per patient. In Scotland, Kadcyla has never been available on the NHS.\nThe Scottish Medicines Consortium, which makes its decisions independently of Ministers and Parliament, decided in October 2014 not to approve Kadcyla for routine use in Scotland. After considering all the available evidence, it felt that the health benefits were not sufficient in relation to the treatment’s cost. Patients have, therefore, been able to access the drug only in exceptional circumstances through individual patient treatment requests—IPTRs. It is estimated that more than 100 women in Scotland could benefit from Kadcyla annually.\nA Kadcyla discount has been offered by the pharmaceutical company Roche and it recently wrote to Scottish Government officials about a patient access scheme. Roche has now resubmitted its application to the SMC, so that it can be considered for routine use in the NHS across Scotland. That is currently being assessed—\nKirsten Oswald (East Renfrewshire) (SNP)\nWill my hon. Friend join me in hoping for a positive outcome in relation to Kadcyla for our constituents who are affected by secondary breast cancer, to whom this debate means so much?\nMartyn Day\nI thank my hon. Friend for that point and I join her in hoping for a positive outcome. We expect a decision to be made in March with an announcement on 10 April.\nThe SNP Scottish Government have substantially increased access to new medicines, particularly for cancer, with plenty of reforms and investment in recent years. The Scottish Government will build on recent reforms and make further improvements, in collaboration with patients and NHS staff, by accepting the recommendations of Dr Brian Montgomery’s review. Shona Robison, Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Sport, has announced that the Scottish Government will take forward all 28 of the review’s recommendations. Dr Montgomery was tasked to examine how changes made to the Scottish Medicines Consortium process in 2014 affected access to medicines for rare and end-of-life conditions. His recommendations set out how the process for appraising medicines could be made more open, transparent and robust.\nAmong the Montgomery recommendations—the House need not worry; I will not list all 28 of them—is to give the SMC an additional decision option of an interim recommendation for use subject to ongoing evaluation, which will allow collection of more data on a medicine’s real-world effectiveness. Another is the introduction of managed access agreements, under which medicine would be provided at a discounted price for a period of time, again to collect real-world data on its effectiveness. Another recommendation is to make greater use of national procurement in NHS National Services Scotland— NSS—to lead negotiations on cost with the pharma industry to get the fairest price possible. Better capturing of patient outcome data in the real world is vital to enable us to determine whether medicines are bringing the expected level of benefits to patients.\nBeyond the recommendations of the review, Ms Robison has also announced improvements to the processes for non-routine access to medicines on an individual case-by-case basis. The peer approved clinical system or PACS, piloted in Glasgow in 2015 to handle applications for ultra-orphan medicines, has been successfully rolled out across Scotland. A second tier of PACS will now be introduced to replace and build upon the existing individual patient treatment request system. A new national appeals process will be introduced through the new tier of PACS, and that will include consideration of equity of access with other parts of the UK as a material part of its decision-making process.\nIn November Gregor McNie, Cancer Research UK’s senior public affairs manager in Scotland, said:\n“SMC does a difficult but necessary job to assess whether new cancer drugs should be made available on the NHS. Following the SMC reforms, we’ve been pleased to see a significant increase in the availability of cancer drugs in Scotland and we support the review’s recommendations to make further progress.”\nBreast Cancer NOW has said that,\n“Scottish Government reforms give fresh hope for a medicines system that will put patients and their families first.”\nIt also said:\n“Scotland’s approach to reform is a useful example to the rest of the UK about ways in which the system can be improved.”\nKirsten Oswald\nI thank my hon. Friend for his words about the flexibility of approach and the need to continue to keep pushing forward to ensure that we continue to allow access to as many of these drugs as possible for the people who are in such need. Will he join me in commending the Scottish Government and the SMC for that approach, and in hoping that it will continue and make a difference?\nMartyn Day\nI do indeed join my hon. Friend in those comments.\nA new and ambitious Scottish cancer strategy, launched in 2016, aims to stop anyone dying from breast cancer by 2050, and breast cancer is of course a priority in the Scottish Government’s detect cancer early initiative. We need to do many things to move forward in that direction.\nNo debate seems complete these days without reference to Brexit, and this issue is no exception. The Health Secretary has stated that the UK will not be in the European Medicines Agency. If so, there could be implications for the way in which medicines are regulated, and marketing authorisations will be required from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the UK. I am in no doubt that the implications will be less efficiency and possibly longer processes for obtaining authorisations, resulting—I fear—in innovative drugs taking longer to reach patients. Some industry leaders predict delays in the region of 150 days, based on the examples of Switzerland and Canada.\nAccording to a piece that appeared last year in the Financial Times, when Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of the MHRA, was asked whether it would be able to take on all the extra work registering new drugs and medical devices currently carried out by the EMA, he said, “Certainly not”. It seems that considerable investment and recruitment will\nbe required to re-establish it as a stand-alone national regulator. I am keen to hear from the Minister how delayed drug access for UK patients will be avoided.\nMr Baker\nI have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, and of course he raises a perfectly reasonable concern, but the campaign director of Vote Leave had, as one of his particular bugbears, the costs associated with the clinical trials directive and its prejudicial effect on innovation in medicines. I hope that the Government can find a better way through than the previous system and that, in leaving the EU, we will not only solve the problem of the EMA but have a better regulatory system afterwards.\nMartyn Day\nI thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, and I look forward to hearing the outcome.\nIn conclusion, with regards to Kadcyla, I hope the company’s resubmission to the Scottish Medicines Consortium is at a fair price to allow it to be considered for approval for use in the NHS in Scotland. It would give people across Scotland the opportunity to benefit from more treatment options and could give them precious extra time with their families and loved ones. The Scottish Government, the SMC and the NHS have worked hard to reform access to new medicines, but we now need pharmaceutical companies to do their bit by bringing forward much fairer prices for new medicines, so that access is as wide as possible for the people of Scotland. Cost-effectiveness is a key marker in ensuring that drugs are routinely available in the NHS, and I take the opportunity to emphasise that point to the pharmaceutical industry in general.\n15:17:00\nMrs Sharon Hodgson (Washington and Sunderland West) (Lab)\nI thank my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) for securing this debate, following the very sad news that her friend Samantha Heath, who had been receiving this life-extending treatment, had heard from NICE that it was being taken away from her. I am pleased that she was able to secure this important debate through the Backbench Business Committee.\nI also thank all colleagues who have attended the debate and made excellent speeches, sharing with us their experiences and thoughts, including the hon. Members for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart), for Portsmouth South (Mrs Drummond), for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins) and for Wycombe (Mr Baker), my hon. Friends the Members for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds) and for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane) and the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Martyn Day), who spoke for the SNP. I am sure that the Minister has been given lots to think about, and I look forward to her response shortly. I also thank Breast Cancer Now for its work campaigning on this matter, along with Breast Cancer Care for its continued dedication and its support and advocacy for individuals with secondary breast cancer.\nIn my contribution, I will first briefly establish the documented and perceived benefits of Kadcyla, and then, building on that, discuss the broader issues around the provision of off-patent drugs, before moving on to present the problems with determining the funding of a drug based principally on its cost-effectiveness as judged by NICE.\nKadcyla’s continued funding through the cancer drugs fund in 2015 was a great success for patients and patient advocates. At the time, the value of the drug was recognised and the concession was made that, despite its high cost, its positive impact was worth the funding it needed. Yet just over a year later, the alterations to the cancer drugs fund have prevented the future funding of this drug, along with, potentially, that of a number of other secondary breast cancer drugs such as palbociclib and Perjeta—I hope that I pronounced those correctly—as it moves towards becoming a funding mechanism for under-researched but innovative drugs with cost and value as a principal driver, and away from its original principle, which was to finance drugs that were too expensive to be recommended by NICE but proved effective in treating cancer patients.\nWe can all agree that patients have benefited significantly since the introduction of the cancer drugs fund, but the progress that has been made in recent years in improving access to cancer drugs is now at risk. That is unsurprising, given the cash-strapped state of the national health service—we have discussed that in the House recently in the past few weeks—which faces pressures to provide these costly drugs that are developed by large pharmaceutical companies, and is forced to consider costs rather than clinical need. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether those concerns have been assessed, and how she plans to address them. We have heard a number of good suggestions today about how funding may be redirected.\nMary Glindon (North Tyneside) (Lab)\nIs not the situation made all the more poignant by the fact that since 2001, the incidence of breast cancer has been rising by 9% every year?\nMrs Hodgson\nThat is a very good point. It may be that more and more people are coming forward and being diagnosed, but, as my hon. Friend says, this will clearly become more of an issue, not less of an issue, in the years to come.\nAs we have heard today, it is estimated that Kadcyla benefits 1,200 women every year in England alone, and that on average it can increase the length of a woman’s life by six months, although reports suggest that in the case of some women that can stretch into years. Even if it is measured in months, however, the extra time is surely priceless to the women and families involved. I speak from personal experience, as I lost my mother-in-law to secondary breast cancer 20 years ago this year, when my children were very small. I know that she fought for every extra week and day in the end, and that she would have given anything for an extra six months to spend with her grandchildren. We all wanted that little bit longer for her. For all those 1,200 women, that extra time is time with their families. It means seeing their children reach perhaps one more milestone, starting school or university, getting married, or even giving them a grandchild. What is the cost of such moments, such memories, which are so precious and which help families so much with what, ultimately and inevitably, will follow?\nIain Stewart\nThe hon. Lady has made a powerful point. In the case of the most aggressive cancers, the period between diagnosis and death can be very short. As the hon. Lady says, any extension of life enabling women to celebrate family events, or anything else, is incredibly important, and we should not lose sight of that.\nMrs Hodgson\nI agree. What price can be put on those precious months?\nThangam Debbonaire (Bristol West) (Lab)\nI have some investment in this. My own experience of breast cancer treatment over the last two years has left me passionate about the issue of prevention and early diagnosis. Will my hon. Friend join me in not just thanking the breast cancer charities—as she has already done—but calling on all Members to spread the word among all the women they know that they must learn how to examine their breasts? I learnt how to do it from a comic sketch in a television programme: that is how I diagnosed my lump. I want everyone to learn how to do it, and also to learn what they can do to help prevent breast cancer, because, although there is no magic prevention method, there are ways of reducing the risk.\nMrs Hodgson\nAlthough we have not so far touched on prevention or early diagnosis, they are vital issues. We have discussed them in the House on many occasions, but they can never be discussed too often, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising them. Let me add that I am happy every day to see her back in this place, and doing so well.\nWhat also stands out with Kadcyla is the reduced side effects, as we have heard, as opposed to alternative breast cancer treatments, the side effects of which can include the inducement of osteoporosis and an increased risk of blood clots. As some colleagues will, sadly, know first-hand or through experiences of family and friends or constituents, the side effects of some cancer treatments can be truly awful, and in some cases are daunting enough to prevent the acceptance of further treatment entirely. It is a common perception that women make the decision to end their treatment much earlier than planned, despite it prolonging their life sometimes. That is because they feel the suffering they are enduring as a result of the treatment is not worth the additional life it is providing to them, because it is all about the quality of that life.\nResearch conducted by Genentech in the United States on the side effects of Kadcyla found that less than 5% of women taking the treatment suffered any hair loss. Through my work as co-chair of the all-party group on breast cancer, I know that hair loss can be a highly traumatic experience for women undergoing cancer treatment and is one of the most discussed side effects of cancer treatment in general. Given that in this debate we are discussing the treatment of secondary breast cancer, which is ultimately a terminal disease, the best outcome we can offer through treatment is both the extension of life and the preservation of the quality of life enjoyed pre-diagnosis. Therefore, because Kadcyla causes fewer side effects, it represents a treatment that can effectively achieve not only an extension of life, but the preservation of some of that quality of life enjoyed by these women pre-diagnosis. So I look forward to hearing from the Minister about what she is doing to ensure women will benefit from this vital treatment in the future.\nI will now move on to how we can better support off-patent drugs, especially for breast cancer. Drug patents typically last for 20 years—although sometimes only 10 years—and at the end of that patent there is very little incentive for the drugs to be licensed for use in another indication. These drugs are still clinically effective in many cases and can be a low-cost effective treatment, but currently the NHS has no method for making them routinely available.\nBisphosphonates are one such example of an off-patent drug that is not being made universally available to patients, despite evidence showing its effectiveness. It is estimated that, if given to the entire eligible population, this drug could prevent one in 10 breast cancer deaths. It is therefore concerning that research conducted by the UK Breast Cancer Group found that only 24% of breast cancer clinicians were offering bisphosphonates to patients. Solving this issue therefore provides an opportunity to improve breast cancer survival rates, and it is something that I hope the Minister will consider carefully.\nI want to finish by discussing the cost-effectiveness of drugs. Currently NICE measures cost-effectiveness using quality-adjusted life years—QALY—and one QALY is equal to one year of life in perfect health. As I am sure colleagues will agree, it is almost impossible to objectively measure someone’s quality of life, and there are questions surrounding the morality of attempting to do so, as raised in NICE’s “Social value judgements” paper on the moral evaluation of drugs.\nAs is so often the case in these debates, a clear cause of the problem lies with how NICE approves drugs. At the last general election, Labour proposed a top-to-bottom reform of NICE, ensuring that drug acceptance and funding is determined solely by clinical need, not with cost or value considerations. This debate shows there is clearly a need to re-address these issues.\nAs I have already mentioned, Kadcyla patients tend to experience considerably fewer side effects, and this can potentially have a positive impact on their ability to enjoy a higher quality of life post-diagnosis. Because of practicality and cost implications, it is almost impossible for NICE to comprehensively and effectively measure this exact quality of life. However, what we can say, without a doubt, is that these individuals would suffer a lower quality of life without Kadcyla, and this, I believe, deserves more attention and value in the process of drug approval and funding.\nThe current funding of drugs is becoming based on the cost-effectiveness of a drug, rather than the clinical need, yet, as this debate has shown, it should not be the final deciding factor as it disregards very personal reasons for many people who rely upon drug treatments. Kadcyla has benefited many women during their time living with a terminal disease, and has now been pulled, devastatingly, out of their reach.\nIt is the Minister who has the levers of power to address the problems in the system which is letting these women down. Members from across this Chamber have eloquently made their case to the Minister. I hope she has listened—I am sure she has—and will give these women and their families some reassurances today.\n15:30:00\nThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Nicola Blackwood)\nA large number of important and technical points have been raised today, and I will do my best to respond to as many of them as possible, but where I am unable to do so, I hope that colleagues will allow me to write to them. I congratulate the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing this important debate, and I join Members across the House in paying tribute to the all-party parliamentary group on breast cancer for all its advocacy on behalf of patients and families. The hon. Lady has campaigned tirelessly to improve access to breast cancer drugs on behalf of her constituents, and I share her commitment to ensuring that patients are able to benefit from the latest effective and often cutting-edge cancer drugs and technologies.\nCancer is a truly terrible disease, and as has been made clear by the many moving personal contributions that we have heard today, there are few of us who have not been touched by it. That is why the availability of effective drugs to treat cancer is of such importance to all of us and to so many of our constituents. I particularly want to thank all those who have allowed their personal stories to be shared today, and all who are here in the Public Gallery. These stories remind us powerfully of why we are all here, and their importance cannot be overestimated.\nSir Desmond Swayne\nThere is an all-party group for almost every disease known to man, with the possible exception of rigor mortis. If patients and campaigners are to have confidence in clinical decision makers, there will have to be profound changes. At the moment, people lobby their MPs, who are uniquely unqualified to make these decisions. May I suggest to my hon. Friend that one of the changes might need to involve a thorough review of the framework and guidance under which the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence operates?\nNicola Blackwood\nMy right hon. Friend makes an important point. It has been made by a number of colleagues today, and I shall address it later in my speech if he will allow me.\nWe want the UK to lead the world in fighting cancer. Survival rates in this country have never been higher, but we must go further. Medicines are a vital weapon in the battle against cancer, but we must not forget the bigger picture. More than half of people receiving a cancer diagnosis will now live 10 years or more; 96% of women diagnosed with breast cancer in England will live for a year after their diagnosis; 86% will live for five years; and 81% are predicted to live for at least 10 years. Improving outcomes for all cancers remains a priority for this Government.\nOur mandate to the NHS sets out an ambition to make England one of the most successful countries in Europe at preventing premature deaths from all cancers, and we are working to achieve this through the implementation of the most recent England cancer strategy. As the hon. Member for Bristol West (Thangam Debbonaire) said, early diagnosis and prevention are essential to achieving that aim. The new faster diagnosis standard will speed up the diagnosis of all cancers. The new standard aims to ensure that every patient referred for an investigation with a suspicion of cancer is diagnosed or has cancer ruled out within 28 days. It is also important that we support further clinical research, as this can have a considerable impact on cancer survival rates, and that is exactly why the National Institute for Health Research spent £142 million on cancer research in 2015-16. And of course we must not forget the vital research carried out by the cancer charities, supported by the millions of pounds donated by members of the public each year.\nThe Government fully understand how important it is that people affected by cancer are able to access new and promising drug treatments, and we firmly believe that clinically appropriate drugs that are established as cost-effective should be routinely available to NHS patients. We all know that these decisions, which can be fiendishly complex, are never easy. We also know from long experience in this place that they should not be made by the arbitrary interventions of politicians. They must be clinically led and made on the basis of the best available evidence. They must also be frequently reviewed when new evidence comes forward. That is why it is right for NICE to play that role in providing independent, evidence-based guidance for the NHS on whether significant new drugs represent a clinically effective and cost-effective use of NHS resources.\nIf a drug is recommended by NICE, the NHS is legally required to fund it, and over the years many thousands of people in England have benefited from the cancer drugs that NICE has recommended. Those include transformative drugs for cancer, such as Herceptin for breast cancer, pembrolizumab for skin cancer and Zytiga for prostate cancer. Unfortunately, although we would all wish it were not the case, there are cancer drugs that NICE is not able to recommend as clinically effective and cost-effective on the basis of the available evidence, which is exactly why the Government established the cancer drugs fund in England. Since October 2010, we have invested more than £1.2 billion in the CDF, which has helped more than 95,000 people in England to access life-extending cancer drugs that would not otherwise have been available to them.\nIn July 2016, as colleagues will know, NHS England and NICE introduced a new operating model for the CDF that builds on that and ensures that it is placed on a more sustainable footing for the future. The new operating model is designed to achieve three key objectives: to make sure that patients have faster access to the most promising new treatments; to make sure that taxpayers get good value for money on drug expenditure; and to make sure that pharmaceutical companies are willing to price their products responsibly and can access a new fast-track route to NHS funding for the best and most promising drugs.\nAs part of the transition to the new operating model, NICE is looking at whether drugs that were previously available through the fund should be funded through baseline funding in the future. NICE has recently been able to recommend two of these drugs for breast cancer, Halaven and Afinitor, as well as a further breast cancer drug, Perjeta. These drugs will now be routinely available to patients. NICE was able to recommend each of these products by taking into account patient access schemes, a mechanism by which companies can improve the cost of drugs to the NHS.\nAs we are discussing today, NICE also reappraised Kadcyla. As the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden rightly explained, NICE consulted on the draft guidance but was not able to recommend the drug for routine use because it is too expensive for its benefits. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart) rightly said, it is important to stress that NICE has not yet issued its final guidance on Kadcyla and will take stakeholders’ responses to the recent consultation fully into account in developing its final recommendations, which allows time for further negotiation between NICE and Roche. That is why today’s debate has been of value.\nI fully appreciate that this is an anxious time for women with breast cancer, but I hope that all here today will appreciate that these are difficult decisions and that NICE must be able to make them free from political interference. I assure the House that, regardless of the appraisal’s outcome, NHS England will continue to fund Kadcyla through the CDF for all patients who have already begun treatment.\nThe hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden and others raised the importance of access to bisphosphonates for breast cancer patients, as well as the general use of off-patent drugs. The use of off-label and off-patent drugs is common in clinical practice, and there is no regulatory barrier to their prescription. NICE often considers off-label and off-patent drugs in guidance and issues advice to clinicians on new off-label uses of drugs.\nThe hon. Member for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds) made an important and informed speech on the issue that proved, in just over 10 minutes, exactly why he is the chair of the APPG. He is right that progress needs to be made in this area. The working group is about to review its latest progress in the next month, and I will certainly take up the issues that he raised with my colleague, the noble Lord O’Shaughnessy, who is responsible for this policy area. I will ask him to respond, especially on sharing the working group’s progress and providing an update regarding the publication of the “British National Formulary”, which the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane) also mentioned.\nThe hon. Member for Torfaen would perhaps like to know that the Association of Medical Research Charities is also working with the Department of Health to facilitate and improve take-up of new robust research findings on repurposed drugs, where appropriate for the patient. I suspect he already knows that, however, given the nature of his speech.\nFor other colleagues who intervened on this point, bisphosphonates are medicines that are primarily used to prevent or treat osteoporosis. As colleagues clearly know, they are also used for a number of other medical conditions, including reducing the risk of primary breast cancer. That is based on the research in The Lancet in 2015, which found that bisphosphonates can be used to help women who are being treated for early breast cancer after the menopause by reducing the risk of the breast cancer spreading to the bone by 28%.\nBisphosphonates are not licensed for the treatment of breast cancer, but because there is good research evidence that supports their use, they can be prescribed to patients for that purpose when prescribers consider that that meets their clinical needs. There are concerns that access to bisphosphonates and their prescription is variable and that there may be some confusion at local level as to who is responsible for commissioning them for such use, so I am happy to share NHS England’s advice on these points. While NHS England is, of course, responsible for commissioning specialised services, the manual for specialised services makes it clear that the decision to prescribe bisphosphonates for breast cancer rests firmly with the clinician and patient, subject to funding from the relevant clinical commissioning group.\nMembers may also be aware that NICE is updating its guideline on the diagnosis and management of early and locally advanced breast cancer. The use of bisphosphonates will be considered as part of the update. The revised guidance is due in 2018. Given the concerns about prescription, my officials have spoken to NICE about the timescale for the guideline, and I am pleased to say that NICE is looking at the feasibility of bringing forward the recommendations on the adjuvant use of bisphosphonates. It will of course be important to consider what the implications might be for the timescale for the remainder of the guideline. I am happy to keep the House updated on that decision.\nThe Government are not complacent about the availability of breast cancer drugs, and we continually look for measures to drive greater access to innovative new technologies. That is why the Government commissioned the independent accelerated access review, as mentioned by the right hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb). Its final report in October set out how the UK can accelerate access to innovative cost-effective drugs, devices and diagnostics for NHS patients and create a more attractive environment for innovators and investors. The Government will respond to the review in the spring, but I acknowledge that NICE must continue to evolve to adapt to changes both in the development of new drugs and in the health and care system. Given the time, and if it is all right, I will respond on some of the details in writing to the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden. We will continue to work with NICE to ensure that its methods remain fit for purpose.\nWe must remember that improving outcomes for cancer patients is not just about drugs. That is why we accepted all 96 recommendations in the independent cancer taskforce’s “Achieving world-class cancer outcomes” report. The recommendations represent a consensus of the whole cancer community on what is necessary to transform cancer care across the whole cancer patient pathway, from prevention and early diagnosis to living with and beyond cancer, including dealing with the side effects, as mentioned so movingly by the shadow Minister. We are implementing that through a strategy that was published in May and we hope to see great progress as it is delivered. As was made clear in the speeches of so many in the Chamber, breast cancer affects many people in this country today. We continue to invest so much in cancer services so that more people survive cancer and that more people live better with cancer. To do that, they need rapid access to more effective treatment, be it surgery, radiotherapy or drugs. That is what I want to see and that is what this Government will deliver.\nI am sure that the whole House will join me in congratulating all who have fought and survived breast cancer. We want to stand alongside everyone who is living with a breast cancer diagnosis, battling treatment and living with the sometimes hidden day-to-day impacts of breast cancer. We remember all those who fought valiantly but lost the battle with breast cancer. We have made much progress in improving care, providing drugs, and funding research, but there is much more that we can and must do to fight this disease. I hope that each and every Member here will do what they have been doing today and hold the Government to account as we move on and try to do just that.\n15:43:00\nSiobhain McDonagh\nI thank all the Members who contributed to this debate and thank the Minister for her detailed response. Most importantly, I thank the women in the Public Gallery for coming here en masse to show their support for this debate. I wish every single one of them well, and I hope that they will join me for tea afterwards. Perhaps unconventionally, I also invite any hon. or right hon. Members here to join me and those women for tea to thank them for their campaigning efforts and to understand more about their case. I expressly invite Suzanne from the office of my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)—there is a cake in the Pugin Room with her name on it. Happy birthday, Suzanne.\nQuestion put and agreed to.\nResolved,\nThat this House notes the provisional decision not to provide the breast cancer drug Kadcyla for use in the NHS on 29 December 2016; and calls on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and pharmaceutical company Roche to come together and re-assess this decision to ensure Kadcyla is kept available for patients, and consider how access to both innovative new breast cancer drugs and off-patent drugs used for breast cancer, such as bisphosphonates, can be improved.",

Under the current plans, the Mitcham War Memorial would be in one constituency, and the Mitcham branch of the Royal British Legion would be in another.\nSimilarly, the Parish of Morden would be divided nonsensically. The Parish Church – St. Lawrence’s – would be pushed in to Sutton, and Morden Town Centre would be merged in to Wimbledon.\nWhen areas and communities with such distinct identities are divided in this kind of indiscriminate way, it dilutes their collective voice. Who will stand up for the interests of Mitcham when it is split three ways? Who will speak out for Morden residents when it no longer has one representative?",
  "http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_/http_www_siobhainmcdonagh_org_uk_campaigns_cost-of-living_aspx/content_35.html": "After finally agreeing that Labour’s long called for Windfall Tax was in fact a good idea, the Chancellor appeared before the Treasury Committee to dissect his cost of living announcements. Because, as always, the devil is in the detail. That’s why I was so furious to learn that anyone who owns multiple homes will take home multiple payments! The more houses they own, the more support they will receive!\nAnd so I asked the Chancellor how many second home owners would receive an £800 discount for their energy bills. The answer? 772,000 - a £620 million pound windfall!\nI asked him how many people own three homes and are therefore in line for handouts totalling £1,200. The answer? 61,000 - a £73 million pound windfall.\nI then asked him how much support he would be receiving for his energy bills. He quickly jumped in to say that he is giving his rebate to charity. Which is all very philanthropic. But as I pointed out to him, isn't this being philanthropic with other people's money? I reminded him of Margaret Thatcher's famous quote that there is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayer's money. At a time when the total tax burden has risen to\nthe highest level since the 1940s, is it really good use of taxpayer money for\nsomebody on the Sunday Times Rich List – or indeed for any MP or Government\nMinister – to receive second home support when others are choosing between\nheating and eating?\nI then asked him about the timing of this support and what it was about the week of Sue Gray's partygate report that made him finally decide to intervene.
