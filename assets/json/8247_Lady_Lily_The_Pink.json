Like I’m in a Banksy installation. “Un-fair”\nI’m on the helter-skelter… only it’s slide is not very slippery so some moments I’m slipping slowly down and in others I’m grabbing the edge and bumping myself further down by force. Not only am I slowly heading down the spiral but the spiral ends in a dark pit of sticky clay so should I get to the bottom by feet will quickly be caked and I’ll be fighting to wade my way back out.\nThere’s a sombre inevitability about it. I’m on the ride and gravity suggests the easiest option is to keep on the ride.\nBut it’s a shit ride and I want to climb off.\nBut do I ride the spiral and try to get off at the bottom? I don’t like the claggy thick clay. It’s really tough to wade through and I’m not sure I have the physical strength to do it.\nThe other option is to stand up on the unslippery slide and walk back up the slope, like a teenager in a kids playground. Declare the ride ‘crap’ and come back down the steps into my Spring garden which I know is just the other side of the gate. Resplendent with tete-a-tete, daffodil, crocus, snowdrop, primrose and camellia all in full glorious bloom. I need to get back to my Monet.\nAt the moment I’m wedged a third of the way down this narrow slide and my too fat frame is friction-wedged against the rough metal. It’s a choice. Push down or pull up.\nThat . My, friends, is the beginning. I’ve been stuck in this bloody Un-fair for days and nights.\nSo I’m stuck in an unreal reality. My head is showing me a gloomy backdrop which is blocking the real view. Some bastard has messed with my mirrors. It’s another exhibit in my Banksy Un-Fair. All the mirrors create a body dismorphic reality. My face is a Jackson Pollok. It’s me but it’s not ME .\nI know what I’m seeing and feeling is not reality, but that doesn’t make it any less REAL.\nIf you suffer from depression , anxiety or hormone related emotional imbalances (and many of you do, I know I’m far from unique) then perhaps you can relate to this.\nI’m sad. I’m angry. I’m guilty. I’m frightened. Shall I ramble on? If I haven’t bored you to press the ‘back’ button yet the next chunk of self-indulgent morose rambling may just tip you over the edge.\nSo here I am in my rose-tinted world still yet, this week, I’m entangled in this heavy thick net from which I am desperately trying to extract myself but it’s becoming such a tangle I’m all tied up and tripping in the chaos of it.\nI can see John out there trying to free me from it. I can hear him telling me to stop struggling as I’m making the tangle tighter. He’s trying to unknot me so I can squeeze out through a gap. I keep managing to get an arm out and he and friends are pulling and holding onto me to stop me getting more entangled.\nFor that I am simultaneously grateful for the wonderful people around me. Sad, at the worry I’m causing. Guilty about being so pathetically self-indulgent. Angry that this has happened, to varying degrees, since I was a teen and still the medical profession fail to recognise or deal with women’s hormonal cycles. Never has a doctor suggested, acknowledged or acted on the obvious fact that I clearly have both a monthly and a quarterly spiral. Never.\nSo. I am grateful to you all for being. I’m apologetic to you all for the lack of rosy-tint in these latest posts. And I am hopeful that the act of writing it (as grey and gloom filled as it is) will give my mind the strength it needs to lift itself up and drag my being back up the slope and so I can climb off this shitty ride.. .\n.\nOne thought on “It’s real but it’s not reality…..”",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_04_20_lies-damned-lies-and-statistics/content_1163.html": "I believe it was Mark Twain who popularised the saying “Lies, damned lies and statistics.” It basically means the use of numbers as a persuasive power to bolster a weak argument. Numbers don’t lie. But their interpretation can.\nYesterday evening I went along to one of the consultation meetings in relation to the South Powys High School restructuring (Builth, Llandrindod, Brecon, Gwernyfed). This came about as a result of a Cabinet approved School Transformation Policy (Nov 2014).\nLet’s be clear, I have one son, he’s 18, finishes his High School education this June and in theory I need no longer worry on a personal level about the state of schools and education in Wales. However, I believe the quality and availability of schooling in an area is a primary factor for families looking to move in and invest there. All communities require the arrival of new young families. They also need to ensure that the area remains attractive to the youngsters already there and that services are in place so they don’t elect to move away when they have children of their own to educate. Without local schools, any town or village is in danger of becoming a retirement village.. not that I have anything against retired people, I hope to be one myself in the not too distant future. Communities need a demographic mix.\nSo I went to the meeting because I was interested , and also because as a standing Assembly candidate I had been prompted with an invitation. There I was sat in my reserved seat at the front of the large sports hall, swiveled round to observe the audience. I went to show support and listen. I did have some thoughts and would have spoken had those points not been raised, but the community had it together. They were informed, clear and articulate in their disapproval, contempt and lack of faith in the plans and the abilities of those in charge of them to effectively implement them.\nThe mood was clear. The parents do not want to give up their Welsh stream or sixth form, The students do not want to give up their Welsh stream or sixth form, The local councillors don’t want to give up their Welsh stream or sixth form. The teachers do not want to give up their Welsh stream or sixth form.\nThe panel appeared disinterested, obtuse and sullen. In the interest of disinterest I have ‘forgotten’ their names. They were however ‘important people’ in high power positions who were not able to say anything that ‘might incriminate them’; so mainly they said nothing. One looked like he was having a snooze. One was being particularly obtuse, seeming to deliberately pretend to not quite understand a question if the person presenting the question was a little nervous or tongue-tied in his/her delivery of it.\nTheir were two representatives there from NPCT who were, embarrassingly (a) not on the panel despite being the only people with answers (if you could call them that) to most of the questions (those in relation to A level provision), and (b) were suitably vague with all their responses mainly ‘we can assure you we can ….”. . The Chief Exec was even what I would describe as both exasperated and slightly aggressive in his responses.\nSo back to those statistics.\nThey don’t take into account that already some o the pupils in the schools travel so they only talk about shipping the pupils from, say, Brecon to Builth… Hence those families to the Carmarthenshire side of the school are likely to remove their children from the Powys to Carmarthenshire schools to reduce their kids travel times… numbers will fall (thank you Kirsty Williams for as ever, clearly, concisely and accurately pointing this one out to the panel). They didn’t allow for those families who would just “go with English” rather than have their kids travel for a Welsh language education; and they didn’t allow for incomers who might have embraced the Welsh language and grown the culture had the language tuition remained at local level.\nThere were no budgeted costings or impact numbers in the statistics to analyse the increased transport costs for busing/taxiing children further. Never mind the carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions, and increased need to repair roads as a result of the extra traffic.\nThere were no numbers to examine the loss of hours, earlier starts, later returns home of children and parents to get to these merged/centralised classes.\nTo me these points and more were made perfectly clear by the attendees:-\n1. small schools in rural communities help maintain and develop community spirit and care\n2 16-18 year olds gain from being in a school environment by mentoring and leading younger pupils. They learn to communicate, interact and care. It is an opportunity to take on some responsibility for others\n3 11-15 year olds benefit from 16th formers as mentors and aspirational role models. Younger children often respond differently to another (slightly older) child than they might a teacher, thus improving pastoral care.\n4.Dual language provision is essential for sustaining the Welsh culture and is important that it be kept at local level so that it is not diluted or lost\n5. NPCT should stick to what it does best and teach, even extend, its vocational base of subjects to broaden the selection of subjects available to 16-18 year olds nd leave A level delivery to the High Schools\n6.Families do not want their children spending up to an additional 2 hours per day travelling to and from school to get the education they deserve. It will be detrimental to their health, their learning and their family\nSo finally I have three things to say.\nThe first:\nRural communities should not be presented with an urban solution to the delivery of education.\nSecondly, but maybe most importantly, lest we forget:\nStatistics can make any point you want depending on which statistics you elect to use and what point you are wanting to make.\nso:\nplease, if you were at any of the meetings or not, whether you spoke or not, I urge you to put your thoughts into writing as well as filling in their questionnaire. The higher the pile of paper they have to wade through the more visual the message they will receive.\nOpinion Research Services, FREEPOST (SS1018), PO Box 530, Swansea, SA1 1ZL\nor\nconsultation@ors.org.uk\nyou have until 5pm on 23rd May\nI agree with you. It seems that everyone thinks the proposals are quite mad. Young people have in South Powys have suffered enough with loss of services, without having schools further and further away from their communities. I know having once upon a time been a young person growing up in South Powys. Where can I get a copy of this questionnaire?\nLikeLike\nI’m afraid you’ve just missed the deadline http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-36413478\nLikeLike",

I haven’t had to make the decision to not work because the jobs I can get hardly pay enough to cover the childcare. I haven’t had to justify staying at home to raise my own child or been forced to take minimum wage, zero hour jobs because being a ‘mum’ is not considered work. I’ve not been forced to go to work to spend all my wage on someone else who gets to see my child grow up. I’ve not been shamed for making the choice to be a stay at home mum. I have a partner, I had family around for childcare support so I had choices. I was not a waster in society for having kids I couldn’t afford, or having kids just so I could claim benefit. Oh no I haven’t had to wear those labels.\nWhilst we’ve both been made redundant in the past, it’s never been in a town or city largely supported by one specific industry so hundred/thousands of people with similar skills found themselves on the job market at the same time. We did get other jobs. We hadn’t slogged the years away in mining towns or manufacturing towns where the whole industry disappeared. Where the job market didn’t exist any more.\nWe’ve also not been out of work and whilst been prepared to take anything, found every single employer considers you are too skilled for the job and won’t take you on because they think you’ll leave for something better. We’ve never not been rejected job after job after job because we’re too old (although they’d never tell you that); we’ve never had to experience the indignity of sitting in front of a job search advisor (or whatever they are called this month) and had to prove that we’ve applied for X amount of jobs no matter how inappropriate in order to get a little bit of money to feed ourselves.\nWe’ve always worked and paid our taxes but never earned enough to take advantage of the tax evasion loophole the corporations, bankers and fat cats have access to.\nAnd, whilst we don’t have a penny of savings and our credit cards are maxed out but we haven’t been in a situation where we’ve defaulted so, we haven’t had bailiffs at our door. Or had to take out extortionate debt enhancing payday loans We have had the good fortune of having parents who could help us in difficult times. And despite no savings and huge debts, we’ve never been struck down by illness that has then forced use to the food banks. We are not vilified by the media and government as wasters or scroungers because we haven’t found ourselves in any of these situations.\nThere have been periods of time where I had to give up work because of my health, but we have always managed to sustain ourselves; so I’ve not had to justify myself for ESA or PIP and suffer the shame and embarrassment of assessments and trick questions, and assumption that I’m a benefits cheat when I’m at my lowest ebb. I’ve not been threatened with sanctioned because I’ve missed an appointment at the jobcentre which is 20 miles away and the bus didn’t show up or I had no money for petrol in my car. Or been too unwell, or confused to turn up on time.\nI never been in a situation where I could choose private healthcare to avoid the long waiting list in the NHS due to the continued cuts in funding. I’ve not had to be on benefits for years because my health was such that I needed an operation or medical intervention but the waiting list was so long I had no choice but to claim social support. So I’ve not been stuck at home wanting to work but not fit to be there, physically declining in fitness as my movement deteriorates from the long wait and my mental health deteriorating from the lack of social interaction.\nI can occasionally (maybe once every month or so) go out for a nice meal with my hubby and kids. I can afford to meet my friends for coffee and cake or grab a pint at the end of the week in the pub. I can even afford a cheap holiday abroad every year.\nMy son did get a good education to A level. and although we couldn’t afford to pay for him to go to university ourselves we’re in Wales and he worked hard and got A’s in his A levels, so he did get a good amount of financial support as a grant plus several bursaries. So whilst he’ll still leave university with several thousand pounds worth of debt from having to get student loans, it will be nothing like the amount many students have. And because of this he has gone to university, he hasn’t had to worry about starting his working life with £20-£30 K of debt and bottled out (and I don’t blame those who do).\nI’m so lucky that I was born in the UK. I’ve not found my family in a war zone or under tyrannical rule. I don’t fear every day for my life, We haven’t had to risk our lives on treacherous journeys because the risk of dying in transit is less frightening than staying where we are. We’ve not arrived in the UK looking for a safe haven, where we won’t be raped, tortured or killed; only to find ourselves in the UK in a border ghetto, or sent back. I’m not considered a drain on society. lazy, a freeloader or a terrorist just because of having the good fortune of being born in the UK.\nI’m not one of the millions of people in this country who have slogged their entire life on a below average British wage, unable to save and reliant on a decreasing government pension despite having paid in my whole life. I’ve not slogged away my whole life and paid into a pension I believed was ring fenced only to discover that a fat cat corporation has squandered my cash or the finance companies have mismanaged my money. (Actually that’s not true, Hubby has lost tens of thousands from his pension pot due to financial mismanagement – but I’m sure those boys still took their admin fees and bonuses as his pension money was frittered away) However, we are not retired yet, we’re not yet reliant on our underfunded and dysfunctional social care system. We’re not yet having to live solely on our State pensions, although we won’t know yet if our compulsory NI contributions through our life have been spent elsewhere and we may yet find there is nothing in the pot for us. However, we do own our house or rather the bank does) but if the worse came to the worse we are in a positive equity situation and could move somewhere smaller But my heart bleeds for those who did their best on their low incomes and paid their stamp and having planned for their future only to have arrived there to discover the coffers are empty.\nIt’s easy to (mis)judge others. Especially if you are one of the ‘lucky ones’ like me. Even more so if you are one of the 13% of the population with private healthcare. Or someone who can go to university without taking out a student loan; or if you earn enough to accumulate savings,; or have inherited substantial wealth; or have no rent to pay; or no mortgage debt; or never have to think twice before eating out; or take luxury holidays as a given.\nIt’s easy to (mis)judge others. Especially, in our society that uses a politicised media to spread propaganda and fear to terrorise and control us.\nIt’s easy to misjudge and to formulate a view based on your own life and how good the system is for us as individuals. But we are all people living on the same planet, going through our daily lives with our individual and shared joys and struggles.\nWe should remember that wealth is often a matter of luck: the country in which we are born; the location in which we are raised; the education system to which we had access; the wealth and education of the parents we are born to; the pay rate for the job in which we have to or choose to work; the health issues we may have inherited or befallen…..\nIf you have been fortunate in these and other areas and the system leaves you comfortable, then that is fantastic, but as human beings we have an obligation to care for those who are less fortunate; to advocate for those who are less articulate; to subsidise those who are less healthy; to feed those who are starving; to protect those who are in danger. We should not just swan along in our rose-tinted little worlds where “we’re alright jack” is the order of the day, and the issues around us are not important because they do not affect us. We have a human and moral obligation to care. And if you have a religious faith, you also have a God-given duty to do so.\nAnyway, I will end this rant in the hope that just one person in the ‘I’m all right jack’ camp reads this and thinks ‘bloody hell, look at what this government is doing to our middle and poorer classes, look at the shame and pain and disregard it is affording our disabled, our sick, our children , our future” .\nIf one person reads this and properly looks out beyond their own comforts to see that the current system does not work for the majority. If that one person then takes action to change the current course; if that happens then this long prose has been worth its while.\nThank you for persevering and reading to this point. Much love, kindness and consideration to you and yours.\nThis blog was inspired after I read a very long but rather wonderful article yesterday by someone called Killy S Jones “The erosion of democracy and the repression of mainstream media in the UK”, I’ve linked to it and you may like to scan though it, but I can understand if you don’t, its pretty full on. At the end are a few excerpts tha may peak your interest.\n“…..Neoliberalism always gravitates towards increasing inequality, extending and deepening poverty. Fear mongering is sometimes used with a diversion or misdirection propaganda technique to mask this,……. …… The process often begins with a marginalised group being singled out and held to blame for the socioeconomic problems created by the system of socioeconomic organisation itself. Using the construction of folk devils (welfare “skivers” , “workshy” “something for nothing culture”, “culture of entitlement” or “dependency” for example), the political class and media generate moral panic and outrage…..”\n“…The Conservatives commonly use a nudge technique called “social norming” …..or “bandwagon propaganda technique”…… It’s about manipulating a false sense of consensus, and normalising (their) ideology……Political slogans like “a country that works for everyone” and the previous “all in it together” are examples of poor attempts at social norming. …”\n“….(The media) process of delegitimisation occurred in several ways: 1) through lack of or distortion of voice; 2) through ridicule, scorn and personal attacks; and 3) through association, mainly with terrorism….”\nHi, it’s Kitty S Jones 🙂\nLikeLike\nHi kitty lovely to meet you x\nLikeLike\nLovely to meet you too, Rose 🙂\nLikeLike",

Having always fancied being a columnist I figured why not share my rose-tinted ramblings with anyone out there who might want to listen- and if no-ones out there, why not write them anyway - bit like a public diary - but hey I have no dirty little secrets that I'm not prepared to share....!!!!\nFeel Good Friday #2\nOMG this makes me want to get on the Heart of Wales Line Train and start a PARTY… #feegood people #anythinggoes # positivenews #sharethelove Source: Feel Good…… Read more “Feel Good Friday #2”\nHow To Tell If You’re A Parent\nOriginally posted on All In A Dad's Work:\nYou might be a parent if… you’ve argued about socks you had to explain the reason for washing…\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2018_02_24_4749/content_144.html": "Today I am in a reflective mood. There’s an air of melancholy. The ground below our feet is a tad rocky. There’s a rumble and it’s rocking our inner core. I can’t discuss much other than the emotions. Alongside the local community tragedy that rocked our little village, is traumatic news relating to a friend. There’s nothing I can do about these things other than try to get to grips with my feelings and emotions relating to them. And decide how to react and behave in the wake of them… and how to interact with and support those close to me.\nAt the moment it would be easy to look at the news;: gun violence and tragedy in the USA; unsettled economy and political infighting in the UK; increasing numbers of people living on the streets; sexual misconduct by (it feels) just about every man in a position of power and trust; greed and selfishness. I’m not even going to start listing all the other tragedies in the world new. But just like all this terrifying political news, wars and natural disasters; those incidents and happening nearer to home are equally out of my control. Yet being closer to home the nerves they touch are more raw. The impact more personal; the aftershock more pronounced. Yet I remain helpless to change anything. This morning I was reading a blog post by Lucy of What My Fridge Says, entitled You Are What You Love and it reminded me that all we can do is be better people ourselves. We can be what we want the world to be.. we can love ourselves and be loving. Be kind. Be compassionate. We can give, listen, care.\nIf each one of us individually strives to be a better person then eventually this world will be a better place. Ok we can’t stop all the tragedies; natural disasters will happen; people we love will get ill and die; but we can all be more caring. We can be more open; both in our heart and our minds. We can choose love. And if we can choose love despite everything we see in this world, internationally and close to home, we can help make the world a better place.\nToday I am the warm sun cutting through a cold crisp winter morning…\nWhat a beautiful post – choosing kindness and openness would definitely help this world be a better place to live. I’m so sorry you’ve had some bad news in your village and about your friend. #thesatsesh xx\nLikeLike\nWhat lovely words that are so very true x\n#thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nThe world can seen so depressing and our role in it do helpless… We have to start with ourselves x\nLikeLike\nWhat a lovely post. I’m hating the news at the moment, but you’re completely right – if we want the world to be a better place where better to start than spreading the love from our little corner of it. Thanks for linking up to #Thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nBeautifully written\nLikeLike\nThank you x\nLikeLike",

We’re all excited at the pace of the project but also sad at the thought it will soon be over.\nThis is where we are now:-\nHowever, like I said before, its more than just a community class. Friendships have blossomed; confidence has been built; laughter has filled the air; stresses have been relaxed; bonds have been forged; support has been shared.\nOur first group consisted of 14 people, 2 left due to commitment at the day of the first block and 8 more joined for the second. So by week seven we had 20. Only 1 left after that, 4 more joined. We are now 23. Next week we start our final block. I think we will be 26 plus us teachers. Eleven of these ladies have been with us since the beginning of January.\nMany have taken up stained glass as a long-term hobby. Several have gone as far as finding a spare room in their home and buying all the kit. So who knows, as well as new skills and new hobbies, possibly even new livelihoods,\nAs a group we have shared our strengths and supported each other through weaknesses and doubt. We have recognised and enjoyed new friendships, formulated new working associations; started new voluntary and community projects for after this one; a social project is developing as a result; business opportunities have come through our networking.\nMyddfai Hall gains from the regular custom; we generally have dinner together after class. Visitors to the centre have been delighted and astounded by the achievements to date. Photos have been taken and word has spread (possible across continents!). Many visitors want to return to see it in situ. This project is strengthening Myddfai’s reputation as an enterprising, cohesive and supportive community. Its impact in its location in the Brecon Beacon, far outways its size (population c300), This is a village that has worked together to create a community and has created a strength, a business and an extended family as a result. It is truly a cohesive and loving community.\nThe enthusiasm for the class is such that most arrive much earlier than the official start time to ‘get going’ and many don’t leave until way after the official finish. Pretty much everyone has taken something home to work on. Everyone has made enormous progress and managed to make several pieces for themselves (or their friends and family).\nIt has become a social club that participants anticipate with delight each week. They want it to continue after the project is done. That’s fantastic news,. I guess will have to come up with a plan to carry on just for fun……\nCan only second what Jane has said. Can’t imagine life without meeting everyone for glass work, coffee, cake and comeradery. Please can we get together and agree what’s needed to ensure this group has the opportunity to continue. Well done Bernie and Lesley, not just for what you’ve helped amateurs create but for just being the most amazing, inspirational and lovely people. You should be really proud of yourselves and the Trustees if Myddfai Community Hall should be thankful that they have you to fulfil such an amazing project. Sue xx\nLikeLike\nI can whole heartedly say this has been one of the best moments of my life, I love the class and seeing our project taking shape fills us all with such pride, to be part of this community project is truly amazing! The new friendships I have made and the chat and support we all get and give to one another is the best ever! Berni and Lesley are the most encouraging and supportive teachers in the world, you have given us all so much confidence to be able to do this…we all love you heaps! Thank You!!!! The staff at Myddfai Community Hall are so welcoming and the food is lovely and the gifts that are for sale are quite unique…as is the Myddfai Community! Just shows what can be achieved with the dedication, commitment and hard work of some great people! Please don’t let this class end! Jane xx\nLikeLike",

What a blast. What a testament to friendships and family. John, my hubby (we’ve been happily not married now for 22 years) had his 60th.\nAt this point I must remind everyone that I am much MUCH younger than him. I may have mentioned it once or twice before.\nFriends and family began arriving on Friday, the pre-party party wound up at 2am after much merriment and a little practice drinking.\nI, and my amazing friend Kate, had been at the party for a week. She created the most incredible chocolate overload of a cake ever (plus an extra one for our son for his birthday 4 days later). Between us we prepared enough food for a hot buffet to feed sixty people. Wonderful friends from Essex , acquired fireworks (well a 5th of November birthday really does need a display), as they really are the experts in that field having hosted annual displays for god knows how long. Family and friends began to arrive throughout Saturday in camper vans and cars, so we headed to the pub.\nMusicians. Who knew we knew so many who would generously offer their talent for the longest open mic session know to Llanwrtyd 9pm until 3;30am was filled with jamming and talent and more talent and more variety of great music – we had blues and rock n roll, folk and rock. Guitars, drums, bass, djembe, harmonica, violin, vocals, percussion. Music, dancing, friends and laughter. A wonderful, wonderful night.\nAnd what does one buy a man of sixty? It seems alcohol is they way to go!!! We have enough to open an off-licence…. or see us through to Christmas anyway 😉\nSo, now I’m recovered (recovering), I want simply to tell you all how blessed I am and how loved he is. So many people. So much love and laughter. So much joy and happiness. So much generosity of time and spirit. So much wonderful community. We, because of you all; friends new and old; near are far make our community; our world; our life.\nI spent some time trying to finish that sentence with another word. You make our world “good” “joyous” “safe” “happy” “whole” “fulfilled” …all those things and more….but simply, you really do “make our world”, and we love you all for it xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

I’d fallen a little behind due to not wanting to garden on Saturday what with it being National Naked Gardening Day; I honestly felt that my elderly clients and the passing traffic could do without it!\nAnyway it was with glorious sunshine and fully clothed I cleared two big gardening jobs yesterday and managed a couple of hours in my own garden too.\nHowever, in the first garden I’d been bitten 3 times by red ants. By the time I finished the second job my arm from elbow to wrist was swollen to twice its size. I took antihistamine as soon as I got home, but it was really hot, red and tight.\nI put a bicarbonate of soda paste poultice on it to try to neutralise the formic acid but mainly to cool it and reduce the aching. But it didn’t help and being my writing/ typing hand I just didn’t get a blog written.\nAs you can see, I’m writing now. Swelling has halved, itching has tripled, and bite points have blistered; but a course of steroids and stronger antihistamines are doing their thing.\nAnd after that tale of woe I owe you something cwtchy from Cerdyn Villa…",

He’d also been a dad before (two boys now in their 30s).\nHaving discovered #TheDaddyTag via the responses on twitter from @ShinnersBrood who has nominated me to do it (Thank God! I was desperate to give it a go and gave a HUGE HINT); and as a result of my unofficial New Years Resolution to ‘get to grips with twitter’ (yes that means #hashtags and #linkys but DOES NOT commit me to being an organised and predictable blogger- I shall be continuing my Random Ramblings at random intervals as life continues to inspire me) I have discovered both #EatsleepblogRT and #wineandboobs ( #snigger)…. anyway, as ever , I digress….\nI wondered how my man viewed his first and second times as a dad.Here’s his responses to #thedaddytag challenge …\nAre you a Stay at Home Daddy or a Working Daddy?\nI’ve been lucky enough to have been both, given two shots at it.\nWould you have it any other way?\nFirst time I always felt I wasn’t home enough. Second time I was older and not so financially strapped so was able to balance life better\nDo you co-change dirty nappies? Even the very smelly ones?\nI did with all of them… thankfully he (they) can change his (their) own now!! First time round it was my job to wring out the stenching nappy bucket (back in the 80’s it was still terry towelling… I did it with a tea-towel masked to my face. Modern dad second time round it was a breeze – no poo scraping and bleach soaking.\nA little fairy gives you the possibility of breastfeeding? Are you going for it or do you run away?\nooo err, I’d probably have been too busy playing with my tits!!! Seriously though it would be great to give it a go. Hell of a bonding experience.\nWhat is the one must-have item for a daddy?\nIt’s not an item its a mind-set – the ability to not be embarrassed to act like a child. Climbing trees, jumping in puddles, crawling around on the floor to play cars.\n(I must chip in here – he always acts like a child and is happy to make a fool of himself – even if the ‘kids’ aren’t around…. I find it quite endearing)\nHow many kids do you plan on having?\n(Sniggers), not any more certainly! Threes anti social enough! I planned on two but then again didn’t expect to find myself having a second chance. B wanted kids and I think it’s every womans right to do so. I was, needless to say, more than happy to oblige\n(Chipping in again , I might point out that he’s a very lucky boy and I’m MUCH younger than him, I wanted a child before I was 30 and J was born 10 days before my 30th birthday – well done John!)\nLads’ nights? How often do you have them?\nI’m not really a ‘lads nights’ sort of guy.\n(Even now I’m the one for the nights out and he stays in to enjoy the peace and quiet)\nYour children’s favourite achievement?\nnow they’re grown I can honestly say there are so many and I’m proud of every single one of them from all of them… Proud Dad\n(truly proud, and rightly so, all his (our) boys are gorgeous inside and out – he even has a YouTube channel called Proud Dad 1956 – yes he really is 60 now!!! Did I mention I was much younger? 😉 )\nWhat is your best memory with your kid(s)?\nJust playing. whatever that may be ; board games, cars, train sets, running around, kicking a ball, whatever that may be. Playing…\n(we still play – the good thing about boys is they never really grow up so if there’s a game going, they’re all up for it… whenever any of them are home all the board games come out and everyone has always played to win, no discretion even when they were toddlers – john is very competitive , especially at Monopoly)\nName one thing you miss since being a daddy?\nnothing. honest.\n(In my opinion, he was born to be a dad, he shines when he’s with his kids… now he’s keen to do it again on a Grandpa scale…. #hinthint)\nWeight gain, before pregnancy, during, after and now? And we meanYOU DADDY, not the mummy!\nTee Hee, that’s all to do with beer and bread!!! Contentment = fat; Worried = thin. Kids make me content\n(John has never and probably will never be fat he may gain then lose the same stone. As a teen his waist was 28″ as an adult its been 30-34″, usually 32″… if only mine had stayed at that)\nDream holiday with your kids?\nthe beach – sand castles, dams and digging holes\n(to be honest he does that on the beach even without the kids – it’s just less embarrassing if he’s not building dams alone!)\nDream holiday without your kids or even without the other half? (You’re allowed to dream)\nInternational Space Station\n(I guess he’ll be leaving me at home then, I don’t even enjoy flying!)\nHow has your life changed since having kids?\nBloody hell its been so long! first time I felt the traditional need to be a provider and as i was much younger and newly married I had constant financial worries. Second time round I sill wanted to be the provider but was able to provide in a more well-rounded way …so it was less stressful. But change? I think you would have to go back to the teenage tear-away me to see anyone different than you see now.\nFinish the sentence “It makes my heart melt when…”\nWhen my boys laugh. (Especially if its me that is making them laugh!!)\nFavourite beers brands and football team?\nThe local brew from the walking distance micro brewery “Big Red Chopper ” by Heart of Wales Brewery\nI have no interest in professional football but always enjoyed being on the sidelines in the junior leagues when my eldest played. The other two are like me and have no interest in it (playing or watching)\nHuggies or Pampers?\nBeing a second time round dad, anything is better than terry towelling\nHave you always wanted kids?\nyes\nBest part of being a dad?\nSeeing them learn and grow into happy, responsible adults\nPS: I’ve just let him read it t hough now I’ve added the photos and my comments’ he said , and i quote “well, if I don’t pull after that review …”\nFantastic answers! You got all that out of him very quickly! I had to coax my lad into it! Haha. Well done. He sounds like he’s a keeper! 🙂\nLikeLike\ni think he thought it might help him pull 😉\nLikeLike",

But today marks the culmination of an idea that began as a seed over a year ago, when the possibility of a grant to fund a project was first discussed.\nThen the planning, costing, being on the periphery of providing information for the bid writing; not really expecting it to come to fruition. Then the announcement that the project would run: the time-tabling, the advertising, the organising; again I was on the periphery dropping in my two pennies worth on occasion but largely uninvolved in the process.\nThen the reality; the first class on 4th january 2017; the teaching; the design planning; the drawing; the design approval; scaling up; creating templates; chosing and ordering glass\nAnd now here we are.

Very early for me. Usually I refuse to consider Xmas until after all our November birthdays. Still, I have to accept it’s not been weeks but nine whole months since New Years Eve and it’s just gone in the blink of an eye.\nIt’s been fabulous to be fair, but now Hubby and I are reaching melting point. Personally I feel pretty much physically and mentally broken. And looking at Hubby (despite all attempts to put on a brave face and cope with everything I can’t), it’s pretty clear he’s in much the same place.\nI’m at the point where everything is exhausting. Even the fun stuff. And we all know how I love the fun stuff. But I’m so exhausted I’ve started declining party invitations (shock horror!). The idea of doing anything at all can sometimes feel overwhelming. Not so much the actual ‘Fun’ bit of the fun but the getting to and from the fun. The travelling anywhere at all has become fun prohibitive. I have got to the point where I miss out because I can’t face the journey.\nA few weeks ago, I had a long trip to a social event . I had stressed and cried and panicked about the journey. 500 mile round trip for an event I could not and did not want to decline. But (and I know how melodramatic this sounds) the journey near broke me. Nothing untoward happened. I travelled alone with the radio for company. There were no road traffic incidents; just the usual delays and holdups you would expect entering towns and city and at major road junctions; but the sheer number of hours on the road just wore me down . Both physically and mentally. I hurt for days after and my brain went into ‘essential processes only mode’.\nThe FUN between the two long journeys was fabulous , but the recovery from the travelling made me declare ‘NEVER AGAIN’.\nDespite this, two weeks later we had to do the same journey, this time I had Hubby and Teen in tow. I did none of the driving. And the FUN between the travelling was truly the most fabulous of fun times (that being true even though I’m ‘Sober September-ing and Stoptober-ing… another day , another blog)\nI can’t say the mental and physical trauma I felt was lessened by not having to take responsiblity for the driving. I felt at least as terrible. Physically I ached for days after from sitting for so long; body being ‘rattled’ by the movement of the car and the passing of the never-ending miles; head lolling from the dozing off etc. Mentally it was exhausting and disorienting; the drifting in and out of consciousness into fitful sleep; the sudden awakening from a jolt, sharp braking, sudden lane change, impatient acceleration, road rage rant from Hubby; the hours of conversational silence but at the same time the constant white noise of road and traffic; and then the momentary panic when you open your eyes to find yourself seemingly hurtling towards the back-end of a lorry; or simply being somewhere completely different and not knowing where you are (how do little kids cope with this?!). you get my drift. Drifting in and out of sleep is a mind-fuck. I just can’t handle it.\nA friend of mine struggled for many years with quite severe ME. Her brain would over-react to even the slightest stimulation. Her body would cramp with pain to the slightest of exercise. In order to get a decent nights sleep literally everything had to stop by about 8:30pm. All the things I would think of as relaxing eg: watching a movie, listening to music, chatting on the phone with a friend. Physically she had the same problem no leisurely walks, bike rides, train trips for her. To visit me to recuperate would just be too much to consider. The journey would physically debilitate her for days/weeks, that gentle rattling of the body would render her bedbound.\nI know I don’t have ME, and for that I am very grateful. However, this friend, in her fight to manage her illness and recover some semblance of normality into her life, really did teach me a few valuable lessons. Some years ago, on another occasion when I was far nearer the brink of life overwhelming me, I ‘ran away from home’ and hid out at her house. I literally got in the car to pop to the shops and ended up driving 250 miles to her front door. During those few days we often sat together for hours, in the garden or at the kitchen table; mostly in silence, with gathered windfall fruit and slowly peeled, chopped, cored. It was her self-imposed mindfulness for her own wellbeing and it became my first experience of it. The first time I ever gave myself permission to live just for that moment and no other. To sit there and just be. without the guilt of ignoring the ‘to do list of life’. Self imposed mental recovery.\nThese days I recognise the signs of impending meltdown. Usually before it’s too late and, usually, I find the time and space to do something about it. And usually that something only needs to be an afternoon, a day, an early night, a long bath, a vocalisation, an admittance, a cancelling of an activity, a reality check with Hubby.\nHubby who is a marvel always recognises my need even before I do, and has prepared for it, made space for it. Usually I can (almost) guilt free allow him to take up my slack and not feel (too) guilty for being a wuss and a light weight. Generally I can accept my need to stop for a bit and have learnt to see this recognition as a strength not a weakness. Generally he will just take up the slack and cover for me. And, (trust me Hubby if you are reading this), that part of our partnership is so very highly valued, I recognise it and love him for it.\nHowever this year. Right now. I can tell that he too needs to stop. We both need to seek out the silence and still our minds. Find ourselves. Find each other. We both need a few days without agenda. when we can go or not go; do or not do; talk or not talk. We both need to lock away our ‘to do list of life’ and wallow in a period of free (non) thinking….\nSo our challenge is to find a gap big enough to make this happen…….\nI desperately need a break. I am so tired and being pulled in so many directions it’s untrue. Enjoy your trip. #bloggerclubuk\nLikeLike\ntake the break! why is the person we each take the least care of is ourself ? x\nLikeLike\nReally enjoyed your blog.

Now I have been free of it for 5 years but the lessons I learnt from that dark period of my life still accompany – the need to pay attention to my body’s cues and to care for myself, even when I have other responsibilities. I am glad to hear that writing about this has helped to bring you some clarity and I really hope you have a fab time in Rome! #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nthank you and so glad to hear you are recovered.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2015_11_23_the-illusion-of-time/content_1053.html": "The earth rotates through light and dark; seasonal changes; constellations come and go from our skies. We make sense of this movement by dividing it into chunks: years, seasons, months, weeks, days and nights, hours, minutes, seconds. Man-made constructs to conform our lives and inter-react across homes, towns, countries, continents. We can measure the generations; relate to our ancestors; make sense of centuries and even discuss in terms of millenia.\nIt’s the most fundamental level of conformism that we all participate in. Imagine the chaos if we all did our own thing..\nAnyway the whole point of this is that I just had several family birthdays to contend with. It’s all very inconvenient because they all fall in the same month , in fact, in the same fortnight and right on top of the busiest time of my year and far too close to the celebrations called Christmas. Maybe we should just move them to a more convenient time?!\nAnyway. My son reached 18 earth years and I reached the unwelcoming number 48. That amounts to (roughly) 17,520 days or 420,480 hours. I wonder how many of those I have wasted? I prefer to think there were all of value.\nWhat is interesting is how some of those hours seemed to pass more quickly than others. Some of those summers raced by. Some of those seasons went on for an eternity. Some of those memories seem to have been eons ago others only days. How can it be 18 years (6570 days) since my son was born? It seems to have gone so fast. How can we have only have lived in Wales 11 years? It feels like a whole lifetime.\nIt’s a man-made construct but its far from linear, it bends and stretches, slides and folds. We might be able to measure it but we still have no control over it.\nWe measure our lives in years; for me, so far , that’ll be forty-eight of them.\nMy husband pointed out to me that if I was on Mars I’d only be twenty-four. Sometimes life is so strange I think that everyone must be from another planet. Maybe it’s me. So, I think I’ll go with that. I officially declare myself a 24-year-old Martian. Happy Birthday to me. I’ll be celebrating my 25th in two of your earth years.",

I laugh heartily; love wholely and live completely. I write what I think. Sometimes its fun, sometimes its political, sometimes its frustration, or angst.

I am stuck slumped on the sofa, bloated gut, unable to unfurl, and reading some of my fave bloggers. I’m waiting for the excesses of another ‘eating-as-many-left-overs-before-the-diet-starts’ supper to subside enough to enable me to move again. And I’m sitting here trying not to vomit and feeling thoroughly disgusted with myself…. I’ve just eaten half a carton of Madagascan vanilla custard after a huge bowl of pasta with a four-cheese sauce made with a small portion of the remaining Christmas cheeses.\nThen I come across this hilarious but oh-so-true poem by the very funny and talented Dawn of Rhyming With Wine, and I think ‘I feel your pain’. it begins like this ….\nDear Christmas.\nI’m sorry to write you this rhyme,\nAnd it’s breaking my heart but I think that it’s time.\n…… and if you follow this link you’ll get to the rest of it, plus (bonus) easy access to more of the poems on her lovely blog.\nAnyway, I’ve been meaning to sit at my proper computer and write my personal plan for 2018 but as I can’t shift my lardy butt at the moment I’ll make do with my phone app.\nI never, I repeat, never. Never ever. I never do the resolution thing… especially the ones where you stop things, lose things, give up on stuff. They’re such negative starts to goals. If I do anything (and I usually don’t), I set a positive challenge. …go to at least one live music gig a month; organise date days out with Hubby at least twice a month (that’s this years one); but this year I need to incorporate some of those stop/lose/give up things to my goals. So I need a way to reword them with more positive phrasing.\nThis is my positive plan to improve my lifestyle and well-being in 2018\n- FEEL GREAT in my own body by maintaining a healthier diet and staying hydrated\n- ENJOY LOTS of fresh fish, fruit and vegetables\n- TREAT myself to a fresh pineapple every week. Make loads of fresh fruit salad to nibble on\n- ENERGISE – start the day with a protein rich breakfast – its nutritious, lasts longer and is easy peasy as I have my own hens to provide super fresh eggs\n- SUPPORT my friend and belly dance teacher by turning up to class every week and practicing my shimmying in between. Remember how happy I am when I’m dancing.\n- DANCE- go see all the great local live music that is available most weekends near home, and boogie the weekends away\n- GET MORE fresh air and exercise by planning better to allow myself the 10 minutes to walk to the village rather than jumping in the car. also far kinder to the planet\n- ENJOY MORE date days out with Hubby with ROMANTIC country walks in the gorgeous Mid Wales countryside\n- PLAY MORE. If I want to play in my garden, i shall play in the garden. I love my garden. I love digging, weeding, raking. I give myself permission to spend more time in my own garden\nI refuse to set a weight LOSS goal or an inch LOSS target, but with this little set of POSITIVE actions I’m hoping that I’ll be treating myself to some skinny jeans before the year is out.\nHow do you feel about New Years Resolutions?\n#thesatsesh I love this take on enjoying the fab things life has to offer, rather than wallowing in the misery of cutting out things we enjoy because we feel a certain way about our physical experience, I also adore Rhyming Mums poems 🙂\nLikeLike\nits all about the angle from which you view things x\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nLove this! I never set New Years resolutions either but small achievable goals are perfect 👌 I defo need to go on more date nights with the hubby. I’m always out for dinner with friends but never hubs Lol!! 🤣🤣🤣\nLikeLike\npoor Hubs! I’m also guilty of it… nights away with the girlies, lunches with the girlies, Hubby left at home holding the fort\nLikeLike\n😂😂 at least we’re having fun 😂 poor hubs!\nLikeLike\nDiets are nonsense: slight readjustment of attitude will do it. Sounds like you have it well in hand!\nLikeLike\nhope so. No doubt I’ll be writing about it in a few weeks\nLikeLike\nLook at you, making resolutions fun! Love your take and hope that 2018 is a happy, healthy and prosperous New Year for you and the fam! BTW, diets just suck! #thesatsesh xoxo\nLikeLike\nThanks Lisa. I don’t do diets but am aiming for a ‘lifestyle’ change..aided by the fact that Hubby wants to do a low carb thing. I’m just making my mums recipe chicken soup right now but i might be naught and make kneidlach to go in it, mum sent me matzo meal… can’t get it in rural Wales\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nOh, you just literally took me to my Nanny’s house! A great kneidlach! Enjoy! If you need more it is very accessible here in philly! 😘\nLikeLike\ni can get it when i visit my mum in Southend. big jewish community there and so the supermarkets have a section. But maybe i should take a trip to Philly anyway….\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nHow cool would that be!\nLikeLike\nWhat a fab way of setting resolutions. You’re right, telling ourselves to lose or give up things is really negative so I much prefer your wording. Setting plans for date days etc is definetely the type of resolution I should be setting for myself this year. Lovely post. X #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nthank you. Did you set yourself some?\nLikeLike\nThese are some good positive plans, I’d definitely like to get outside more #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nOh wow I love this! These are my type of resolutions. I think January is miserable enough without finding a brocolli shaped stick to beat ourselves with. I love the positive resolutions and thank you so much for all the bloglove! 😘😘😘 Happy New Year to you lovely!\nPs. Is it wrong that I now really fancy some custard? 😂 xx\nLikeLike",

I bought it early this summer with a view to converting it into a mobile gallery/craft outlet complete with sofa bed so I could attend festivals, fetes, car shows – sell my wares and have a comfy, canvas free sleeping plan.\nThe second impulse purchase was following our camping trip to Perth in early August. As a result of Jill’s\nfabulous tardis of a Rapido we decided that life would be impossible to sustain without one of our own. Ebay helped us and for a bargain price of less than £400 – delivered. i now own this. I figured that if the old couple on the campsite in Scone could do it, how tough could it be. I came home to it erected in the garden – 3 people , 2 hours to erect !!!!!!!!!!!!\nSubsequently I contacted the Rapido Owners Club (there really is a club for everyone out there1) and purchased an e-brochure with the the schematics – wiring diagrams, part numbers ,folding and erection details. We shall fold it away later today. john and I. I plan to video the experience – on request , the unedited version of this process with be uploaded to Youtube and this blog for all to learn from (ha).\nNow I am looking for your advice. The idea is that the folded Rapido is light enough to be towed by Ffloyd – in anticipation I have purchased a tow bar….\nIts also big enough for 2 6ft double beds although my plan is to have one top bunk height double on one side with loads of storage\nunderneath – or a double airbed for guests and leave the other half as permanent seating. I’m going to remove the table and make an extra sofa section under the window leaving in ‘U’-shaped. i may even make the additional base bit in case we want more people sleeping in there – cosy communal sleeping for six. complete with kitchenette to fry up the bacon in the morning and outside fridge in that ‘box’ on the outside to keep the milk and champagne.\nAnyway, enough of inviting friends over. first i need to get rid of the musty smell, improve my collapsing and erecting times and make it all pretty and in keeping with Ffloyd. with that in mind, I’m can’t deside whether to paint the wall panels or wallpaper them, probably cream (or green-white)\n.\nI’ve seen this cerise pink leatherette which I thought I’d use as seat covering -recover all the foam- easy to clean. What do you think – too much?\nAnd curtains/cushions/tiebacks from one of the following materials. this is where you all come in – i need you to vote as I can’t choose. Or feel free to offer alternatives. I would like to use her before Christmas. Also folks, she needs a name. Help me – you’re an imaginative bunch.\nSo, sorry , this is the first time I’ve asked you to be interactive and I’ve come in hard with 3 question.\n1. Cerise pink leatherette – yes or no\n2. which curtain fabric- or can you offer a better option\n3. What shall we call her (and ‘no’ i don’t want ‘Captain Rapido’ or ‘Swing Wagon’ – despite the mention of communal sleeping my mind wasnot in the place to which I’ve just led yours!)\nOver to you. I’ll keep you posted\nI really love “Thornbury” and “Daisy ” fabric, plus cream or green paint would probably be easier to paint over marks ect and wouldn’t peel off if she gets a little damp in Winter. I guess it would be difficult to dissuade you from having pink leatherette, Bernie ! As for her name, what about Rosie (or Rosey) or even Rosielee – i think it connects her to your ramblings- both seemed to become part of your life around the same time, good luck with it all, Kate G\nLikeLike\nhiya, i have gone for the ‘daisy’ with the Cerise – now i jst need to learn how to sew!!\nLikeLike\nthis might give you some inspiration:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheHappyCaravan\nJulia x\nLikeLike\nI love the Happy Caravan – am an avid followers x\nLikeLike",

Humour, laughter, (some) vulgarity, a penchant for a wee dram of the strong stuff, Impers, fancy dressers, owners of teenage boys…. we have a fair bit of common ground.\nThe conversation was in relation to a silhouetted man in the tent opposite (from what I remember). It was quite late in the evening after a couple (!) of small (or should I say ‘wee’) drinkies during our camping experience at Perth Race-course, Scone, for IMP 50. I am still laughing about it. Incidentally, this was not the same tent as the one in which the chap was holding a large pig captive…..\nAnyway, after years of attending Imp nationals and choosing the ‘family area’ so as not to be disturbed, this year we chose central ground because of having teenagers in tow. This is THE FIRST year, we (or rather me and my rather raucous laugh) were asked – ever so politely by the club chairman, to keep the noise down -ooops – obviously this only made the laughing worse! Sarah – you are a bad influence!\nNeedless to say we were all getting on rather well. And funnily enough the Liscoes had previously been to Llanwrtyd Wells (in 2008) to take part in a spot of World Bogsnorkelling (which, incidentally falls on 25th August this year and I am organising it on behalf of Green Events Ltd) . Their eldest, and I have to say extremely handsome and gifted son, Sam (no really, I have to, I’m being blackmailed), Sarah and possibly even Rob took part in the WBS Championships & being players of underwater hockey, were particularly good at it too.\nThey also own several Imps and derivatives thereof. And, like us, their boys are also Impers with both Sam and Ollie having Imps and I suspect Jake has a (cunning) plan to obtain one. They had chanced upon Ffloyd in her previous FAB1 guise, outside my (sadly no longer) Powys Creative Crafts shop “In The Pink”.\nTheir Husky is called Kelly. I think kindred spirits have found each other. Need I say more?\nPossibly even Rob??? I may have taken part once or twice… I may even have been the World Champion.\nLikeLike\njust checking you were listening properly!!!\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_08_08_cider-cycling-and-real-ale-wobbling/content_1899.html": "When you drive a pink car, dye your hair pink, have a loud laugh and are prone to spouting your opinion whether its popular or not, you’re hardly likely to be a ‘blend-into-the-background-so-no-one-notices-you’ type of a person. Lucky, I guess then, that I happened upon the quirkiest of locations to call my home.\nThis weekend (Saturday 10th August) sees the inaugural Summer Cider Cycle . Spawned from its father event, The Real Ale Wobble, the few females who lucked up on R.A.W thought it would be ‘nice’ to have cider & sun (although we can’t guarantee that in August in Mid Wales), rather than testosterone, tap beers and snow, for a more civilised weekend of madness in our wonderful little town.\nThe umbrella organisers, Green Events have added this date to their calender of equally wacky and sometimes wackier events. The Summer Cider Cycle falls mid Llanwrtyd Festival; offers a selection of delicious local brew ciders and perrys , disco, live music, camping and 2 separate mountain cycle routes to suit both fun riders and more serious MTBers\nHaving lead the organisation of the father event, The Real Ale Wobble for the previous 5-6 years, I can guarantee you that this weekend is going to be ‘wicked man’ (or ‘sick’ – if you are a 90’s child rather than a 70’s one). It might not attract 700 riders this year ,as is the\nmass of testosterone that arrives in Llanwrtyd in November, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there is quite a turnout for this first event. Certainly the sub committee of Green Events Ltd – Linsey Davies, Neil Delafield and GE Chair, Lindsay Ketteringham have put together some excellent marketing and promo. Whatever the numbers – with 3 pubs – lots of cider, Sir Dangerous Dave, a DJ, a campsite and a microbrewery – its sure to be and continue to become another great Llanwrtyd weekend.\nSadly (!!!!yeah right!!!!), as I’m tied up with The Big Skill in the grounds of Brecon Cathederal , and the Brecon Fringe ( with our sons band, (Lindsays Shirt) playing two sets ) on Saturday, I will have to forgo the opportunity to ride the Cider Cycle (says she who last got on a bike aged 13, unless you count the orange one I rescued from the tip on arrival to mid wales and wobbled about on into the town square a couple of times – but there’s another story). I shall however be joining the reverie at the Stonecroft Disco on Friday night and Sir Dangerous Dave’s gig a the Neuadd on Saturday, probably take a pit stop at the Belle Vue too.\nWhy not join us – cyclists or not – its gonna be ‘sick man’!",

But hey ho.\nWhat an emotional week. I have gone from elation to frustration; seething anger to overwhelming joy; been engulfed by angst to feeling calm and serene; guilty to blessed. I have arrived at this destination, a point in time of emotional joy and bursting with an overwhelming sense of my own good fortune.\nPlanning our 20th anniversary for later this year and realising the depth and breadth of friends & acquaintances we have, has been the major soother and reality checker. Gathering together the important people from each and every chapter, making contact, touching base, and hopefully tempting a few to join us later in the year.\nThat, coupled with overwhelming pride in my son , his commonsense, maturity and general demeanor. He has more patience, maturity and rationale than I.\nI feel proud to have raised such a considerate, well-balanced and emotionally prepared young man. Kudos to me 😉\nThen there were a couple of timely quotes that came to my attention – that one by “Rotten Cards” at the top of this blog was one.\nAnd this was the other.\nI know and my friends know, I will give of my time, energy, knowledge and the little money I have to support or help anyone, but they only ever screw me over twice. Yes, sadly, twice. The first time, I’m prepared to forgive and move on, but the second… more fool me if I do and their loss eh?\nThose two little quotes have enabled me to calm down, assess and re-evaluate. The irony in one instance has made me randomly start giggling to myself. Don’t take it personally if you were caught with me giggling in your general direction – haha.\nPerhaps the most significant was a little throw away challenge in the form of one of the many “nominee challenge” posts any regular Facebook user might come across.\nSomebody posted five photos of herself entitled ” Five photos that make me feel beautiful”. (They also happened to be beautiful photos of her), but the point was images, hence memories, that made her feel special. I commented , she suggested I do it.\nFor some reason, it struck an emotional chord. I enjoyed several days of contemplation, deliberation and looking through old photo albums and picture files.\nI came up with these:\nSo followers, if you are ever in need of reaffirmation try this challenge. I nominate YOU. Find 5 images that make you feel beautiful/blessed. I promise you, the process will take you on an emotional journey and you will feel more whole as a result…\n…and finally…\n..on taking the challenge I snuck in a 6th. OK, not strictly in ‘the rules’ but (a). things were getting a bit heavy up there and I felt I needed to lighten the mood and (b). Hell, the ‘rules’ can be whatever we want them to be….\n..anyway heres image 6…",

I’ve spent about forty plus of those fifty years knowing I can’t sing and being embarrassed to sing where anyone can hear AQ me. It started at junior school when everyone was in choir and I was asked to mime my words. That devastating blow to my self-confidence and shame about my voice has been with me my whole life. I never do karaoke, I mime at gigs and on the odd occasion I do sing out loud I become mortified by any funny look I perceive heading in my direction. And on those occasions I’m asked to ‘shhhh’ I’m traumatized for days.\nThis last year I have been a bit more ‘to hell with it’. After all singing is good for the soul. We should all be able to sing and dance as if no-one is watching or listening. There are only a few places and occasions I just get on with singing but my self-consciousness and knowledge of being terrible at it do haunt me.\nBut. And to me it’s a massive ‘but’. Hubby has taken literally my comment at the beginning of 2017 when I stated that this was my fiftieth birthday YEAR!!! I’ve been receiving ad-hoc gifts throughout. ( I know, I’m a very lucky girl)\nToday though I got a gift that has terrified me\nThis was inside…..\nO M G !!!!!\nSo…..\nDo I laugh? Do I cry? Do I hide myself away in shame? How will I cope with the embarrassment? What if she visible cringes?\nHubby says ‘think how magic it would be if you could learn to sing and felt comfortable joining in”.\nI’ll do it. But it’s going to be the most embarrassing and frightening thing I’ve done since… I don’t even know when. I’m 50 nearly. I should try things that scare me….\nBut what if I’m a lost cause? I’ll be mortified. It’s terrifying! And poor Mrs Galletta!….\nSo what is it you have a hang up about? Or don’t you? Come on, share. Make me feel less freaked…..\nDancing. I love to dance and I’m so rubbish the boys cringe if I dance in front of them.\nLikeLike\nall kids are embarrassed by their parents dance moves!

Buy the correct size\nor\n2. don’t buy it at all\nIt’s easy to buy the correct size, every single item of similar clothing in that females draws, cupboards, wardrobe, ironing basket will have a size tag on it. Buying the right size will not only be appreciated but show thoughtfulness that you have done your research.\nbuy the wrong size at your peril\n1.

Someone somewhere told them (I think this started with Tony Blair) to pause_after_every_word; to keep their hands and arms in an open posture and gesticulate in an up and down motion to the rhythm of their voice; to open their top button to be ‘down with the people’; to use “street speak” to mirror the youth as it would gain their trust… to quote Ed Milliband “Hell Yeah” that really worked out well. All politicians in all parties lost all credibility and most of the voting population.\nWelcome Jeremy Corbyn. I’m not a Labour voter myself, but thank you JC. Real policies which you are prepared to stand behind; your own mind; your own words and your own clothes…. and no stupid hand gestures. Phew It was beginning to look like aliens had taken over the House.\nHow many other people never, ever , ever watch PMQT? But I did (on catch up) yesterday. I think this new era of politics will engage voters. We will have a Socialist Left and a Corporate Right and a space for Liberalism in the middle. And, with a little luck, hopefully nowhere for the extremist Britain First, UKIP, to seep in.\nAlthough equally hopefully there’ll always be a small gap for us Loonies…\nWe must always remind ourselves that in the scheme of the universe, life really is all a bit of a joke and we must always take time to laugh at ourselves. Life is short. Be kind to each other. Enjoy the ride.\nOr we might just end up with egg on our face!\nNice clip, Hariod. Thank you. (in the absence of a Like button….)\nLikeLike\nAnd meant to add: very good article, interesting, and I agree about the penultimate para too.\nLikeLike\nYes, how wonderful it is to see the mainstream media completely flummoxed by Corbyn’s popularity and approach. Straight away, they began their tired old methods of looking for differences of opinion between J.C. and his cohorts, as if the public at large found this relevant at this stage – the death throes of New Labour – and they do not; they can see further than the end of their noses. Your observations on contemporary political methodology and presentation are astute, and it seems to me that Blair’s infatuation with, and mimicking of, Clinton’s style has swept like a virus through British politics. I like your closing observation:\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2015_07_28_the-supermarket-comparison-test/content_1446.html": "I often think all this supermarket advertising is a scam, all these special offers and price match deals.\nI mean, if you think about the “Price Match” it really is a safe bet for the supermarkets. Over say an average £100 shop (average for me anyway) some items will be on ‘a deal’ , reduced or on promotion or you select ‘own brands’ which aren’t included; and others will be dearer. So, over the course of totting up the 70 or so items in your trolley the odds are the price total will even out . However, just in case, the supermarkets add a proviso to their price promise… for Tesco, (who I’ve used for this experiment), they set their refund to a maximum £7 (I think).\nOf course they only offer this price comparison over the ‘leading’ supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsburys, Asda, Morrisons. I would at this point argue that Lidl and Aldi may have a claim to that title too but I don’t think the BIG FOUR dare.\nWatch the Aldi ad and you’re encouraged to: “Take the Aldi Challenge”\nSo I have. I wanted it to be a day I had a large shop to do so I ended up with a broad range of products.\nI went to Aldi today and bought 94 items at a total cost of £86.45\nIt was an interesting experiment because as I was adding things like yoghurt and frozen desserts I noticed that the portion sizes in Tesco were SMALLER. In these instances I have added extra units to get the same grams. With the meat I added the slightly smaller pack sizes (Rump Steak for example- 2 in Tesco =500g in but in Aldi =566g that’s 10% more meat).\nAs such, the comparable Tesco order was made up of 109 items ( The luxury yoghurts in Aldi were 150g I had 12; the Tesco Finest were 125 g so I had to get 4 more: The Aldi Chocolate desserts were 190g; the nearest equivalent, a Tesco Chocolate Surprise, was only 125g so instead of 12 I needed 18. The other differences in numbers were the loose red onions)\nThe total in Tesco was a staggering £123.03.\nTried Lidl last week for the first time in 2-3 years and was AMAZED at the savings. Gradually trying out different things in there, so that eventually (and hopefully) I will hardly have to go into the big supermarkets again for my favourites.\nLikeLike\ni generally find the quality as good if not better – especially with frozen meat/fih and dairy products – the only things i haven’t yet moved away from: Heinz ketchup, Persil Non-Bio (only one my lot aren’t allergic to), Twinings Everyday Tea. And i buy my bacon and sausages for the B&B from local butchers\nLikeLike\nYou mean like politics? 😉\nIn my view, we ought to have a nationalised food supplier to act in competition with private suppliers. It would be managed to produce a profit in-line with those of private concerns, but instead of it going to shareholders, it would return to the national pool of collected taxes. Food is a public good, just as is money, energy, transport, and in fact all utilities. Sadly, the supply all such public goods has been under the control of private enterprise, wherein even money can be brought into existence by virtue of debt creation. This is all proving disastrous of course. As to British supermarkets, then they have been running a cartel in cahoots with suppliers for years, as evidenced by the fact that only when non-cartel competition was introduced from Germany, did prices slowly begin to fall.\nLikeLike\nI am very pleased that Aldi & Lidl have come in and created some competition – but as you say, cartels and corporations still have the control and the politicians are in on it too. Supermarkets don’t offer’great deals’ to benefit poor consumers, they offer ‘fake deals’ to line their pockets. They price small suppliers and independant retailers out of the market and thereby kill the competition and gain more control…. one of my gripes for example – living in Wales is that Welsh lamb isnot only unaffordable but New Zealand lamb is the main supply in the supermarkets and is much cheaper – just one example of control of the market place. AS a nation we made a huge mistake privatising services (gas/electric/transport) and now possibly the NHS – it ceases to be about the consumer and becomes about maximising profit\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nI’m pleased that my little political rant met with your accord Berni – I’m not usually so heavy!\nI used to live on the Pembrokeshire coast by the way, in the Preseli Hills, and miss it at times.\nAll best wishes, Hariod.\nLikeLike\nfortunately you can see from the variety of blog posts that i have many lighter facets!\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nBloody marketing people have ruined life as we once knew it.\nLikeLike\nall marketing is a ‘play’ with words, using positive phrases and convoluted sentences to sound like you are offering something extra, miraculous or better value… my pet hate is “up to 100%”. I always new Aldi was cheaper without compromising quality – in fact , often the opposite, i just didn’t realise how much.\nLikeLike",

From there we took the Santa special to Lapland, where we drank in an ice hotel, rode on dog sleighs, and ventured into the frozen forest to find Santa in his cosy cabin. It was a magic moment, Santa gave him a gift, which was a different Action Man to the multitude of Action Men he already had in his vast collection. How did Santa know he loved Action Man and that he’d not got this one? (Even i was impressed my that I have to say!).\nAfter some hot chocolate and food we sped back across the frozen lake on a skidoo back to the plane. The pilot thought he had seen Santa and the reindeer practicing their take-offs and landings so all the kids were glued to the windows trying to catch a glimpse .\nThen we were home again.\nOn the big night that year as in the previous and the subsequent, we tracked Santa with the help of NASA, noting where he had already been and how many presents they thought he had already delivered. Most importantly , how long before he arrived with us!\nWe’d put milk and carrots outside the back door for the reindeer. Quality Street and Ribena for Santa (we didn’t want him to get too tipsy before he’d finished his nights work). The reindeer always spilt some of the milk. Santa never managed to eat all the chocolates… but who could blame him, mince pies, biscuits and chocolates in every house… he’d eat one or two and take a sip of his drink.\nOne year our son was amazed ‘look mummy Santa’s used the same wrapping paper that you had last year!”…close call that one.\nThat magical trip to Santa’s home cemented his belief in Santa beyond that of his friends with elder siblings and those who had never really met the ‘real’ Santa, (just his helper Santa’s who covered the stores and streets taking messages on the run up to Christmas).\nOne teary afternoon at school pickup a couple of years later my son had a disagreement with a lad who tried to tell him Santa didn’t exist. He was so frustrated and angry at that boy.\nOf course over the next year or two the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny became games we played rather than reality. A tooth under the pillow meant a shiny coin in the morning. and to this day we still have an Easter Egg Hunt (he’s 19, but he and his friends insist!).\nI fretted and became quite anxious about the day he would ask if Santa was made up. In my mind I over-analysed the potential damage I had done to him through ‘lying’. I over talked it with my hubby and it became quite a nuisance in my mind. Then I worried and fretted that he was the only one who still did believe and was arguing vehemently with those who disagreed. I became concerned he’d be ridiculed or bullied.\nOf course none of my fears played out. The doubts about Santa crept in slowly, we kept playing the game, he kept pretending because he thought if he didn’t he might not get gifts! And anyway it was FUN. Eventually the conversation had to happen.\nI told him that whilst Santa himself isn’t real the ‘magic’ really is. The fact that everyone plays along and joins in the fun makes it pretty amazing. NASA has Santa tracking software for Christs sake! The pilot on the aeroplane that time had been in on it. All the adults, all the older brothers and sisters all played along to make it special. Never mind the fact that families all got together and had a lovely time together; charities raised extra money; humanity showed itself to be altruistic and generous; empathetic and caring to the wider community. All of that goodwill and kindness; all of those stories and symbols made for a pretty spectacular kind of human magic.\nOK so these days we don’t put out carrots and milk or chocolates and ribena. And we don’t have to keep sending him back to bed because its only 5am, 5:30am, 6am… In fact for a few years through his early teens it was hubby and I knocking on his door asking if we could go down for a fry up and to open presents! These days we have a wonderfully leisurely morning on Christmas Day. Then, whilst dinner is cooking, we take a stroll to our local pub where the community gathers for a pint and to wish each other a merry Christmas. Sometimes in the village square there are carols on horse back with riders in tinsel handing out song sheets to the families milling around. Then its home; a couple more pressies; a few drinkies and then a late lunch/early tea. A Christmas festive bonanza. Usually with at least some members of the family are with us; always with a spare place set to remember those who can’t be with us. Later its board games, laughter, phone calls, drinking, more present opening (we do tend to take our time).\nIt truly is a magic time. Sometimes it happens several times in the year. With family spread far and wide and parents getting older by the year (as they do), we might have several mini Christmases in several locations over the coming weeks. For some years, for hubby’s parents , we held a special Christmas during their visit to us in May… seeking out a tree and putting up some decorations, ensuring we had crackers left over so we could pull them with lunch.. and of course Christmas dinner, with all the trimmings, presents and board game playing. Yes, magic indeed.\nJust because something isn’t real, doesn’t necessary make it any less valuable or meaningful. For our family at least, the magic which was passed to us, has been handed down to our son. One day, he will be adding little traditions of his own to create a unique magic for his own family….\nIn the meantime, don’t worry about your kids as they grow. I don’t know why I worried about scarring our son when he discovered I’d been “lying”. I never felt scarred by my parents. My own magic and enjoyment of Christmas has continued to grow as additional practices get added to our family traditions. so on the run up, I shall very much look forward to this coming Christmas; to the extra effort we all make to touch base with our friends afar; to the arrival of family members; and the spending of extra time with friends.\nMerry Christmas, Happy Festivities, Goodwill, peace and kindness to you all\nSee you next year xxxxx\nI can’t event remember when I found out the truth really, I think it was from someone at school maybe! I think it’s good to keep up the pretence and kids just naturally figure it out. They have the presents and food to distract them as well! #fortheloveofBLOG\nLikeLike\nLovely post, made me feel quite emotional. My boys are 6 and 3 so we’re in the thick of the magic. Reassuring to know that the Santa magic simply changes into different sorts of magical times. Funnily enough, I don’t remember when I stopped believing. #brilliantblogposts\nLikeLike\nAaah. Lovely post. I’m in my 30s and choose to believe in it all. It is magical and that magic is real. #fortheloveofBLOG\nLikeLike\nHooray for love and magic x Merry Christmas, I hope Santa brings you something lovely xx\nLikeLike\nHappy New Year to you and yours. Don’t stop believing in Magic. xxxxx Graham and Sue.\nLikeLike\nThanks. I won’t. I can’t. It’s all around me xxxx Happy New Year to you both\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_08_10_d-i-why/content_1733.html": "We moved here eleven and half years ago. Feb 4th 2005 to be exact. The house was run down and dated but we could see past all that.\nWe needed to start receiving B&B guests that May so, as we walked through the door on that first morning we started ripping out carpets as we wandered from room to room. Thirty years of coal and wood grime and a good inch of dog hair; we wanted them out before the removal van arrived.\nThis was followed by the fun bit, four weeks of knocking the crap out of the place; chipping back plaster; taking walls back to brick until they stopped crumbling away; scraping off wallpaper; whacking stuff with hammers. You would not believe some of the findings. Wallpaper held down with masking tape to keep the crumbling walls in; slivers of soap and old newspaper to fill holes and bridge gaps!! Four weeks later our plasterers who had helped us finish our old house (so we could move on), arrived to cover the walls back up again. We followed them around painting and decorating.\nBy May Bank Holiday 2005 we had the house ready from the front door, through the hall and into the guest dining room; up the stairs and into the two guest en suite rooms. All our own space was in the same sorry state we found it.\nWe did get our bathroom finished. John was amazing. I wanted twinkly lights so to create this effect (baring in mind the added complication of a curved ceiling). John build a false ceiling, drilled 250 holes and threaded them with 1/2km of fibre optic cable before I helped him manhandle it into position.\nThis involved me standing on the edge of the bath, balancing that end of the ceiling on my head whilst he fixed the other end in position. I also wanted black tiles floor and ceiling to create a feeling of ‘floating in space when standing in there at night. I know , I’m demanding, he’s patient and obliging. Especially considering that the glue dissolved the mosaic tile backing meaning that each 2cm square tile had to be attached individually. (I imagine lots of swearing under John’s breath and fake smiles through the 50 hours it took to create my dream).\nAt some point during the last eleven and a half years we have managed to (almost) finish our living/dining room, the floor is still as we found it having lifted the carpets on day one. We just can’t find time or energy to sand the floor boards. Plus there’s a troublesome little DIY conundrum to get our heads around before we do …. the room was previously two rooms but had been knocked through at some point in its past. The floor on the living room side and that in the dining room are slightly different levels and the gap in rough, uneven concrete. For eleven years we’ve ‘dealt with it’ like this…. a sheet of wood and gaffer tape…its become a bit of a feature…\nThe kitchen we acquired with the house was a 70’s extension to the 1907 original build with the added quirk of a second ‘fix’ whereby a larder had been knocked out and a back porch had been added. The floor with quarry tiles suffered the same idiosyncrasy as the lounge/diner; a line of concrete where the wall had been between kitchen and previous larder space and slightly different levels.\nThere were two different types of 70s cupboards and two different types of 70’s laminate worktop. I coped for a couple of years and then John promised to build me a kitchen. It’s about 60% there!!\nJohn built the cupboards; they’re so substantial you could save yourself by hiding in the during a bombing raid. They never quite got finished beyond the primer. I added the mural in Spring 2016.\nJohn has however resolved the floor issue here; leveling and quarry tiling throughout\nAs for the worktops. The kitchen is bespoke, lots of curves and odd-shaped worktops required. I don’t like to make it too easy. so we cut out some temporary ones for the shape some years back, and there they remain! We wanted stone. Five years or so ago we got round to sourcing some . Too expensive. We could never raise the funds. We had some grandiose idea of using recycled glass composite and moulding our own with the help of a local entrepreneur; John even researched how to go about it using YouTube videos; but it all got a bit complicated. We considered polished concrete. We even acquired a DIY kit to do it ourselves. I have no idea what happened to it.\nLast month I called in a carpenter. He’s coming in September.\nThen there’s the outside. It needs painting. its needed painting since we arrived. At some point we started glossing the window frames. and at some point we slapped a coat of cream/beige on the front lower half. I’ve always wanted t sunshine yellow. Starting yesterday we’re getting sunshine yellow.\nI have no idea how I’m going to tackle the front upper half over the veranda. Perhaps John can dangle me out of the first floor windows and hold onto my legs…..",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_03_19_smoke-and-mirrors-life-in-the-real-world/content_1527.html": "I recently dipped my toes back into what has become to be known as the ‘real world’. You know, that place of business and commerce , success measured by title, possessions, wealth and hierarchy. It was a short lived, interesting and welcome experience. It reminded me of my own success and wealth in my ‘Alternative World’.\nI’ve never been driven by money or title, had my eyes blinkered on climbing the ‘career ladder’ striving for recognition, advancement, ‘power’. My motivators have been ‘simpler ‘ things. and as I’ve aged and gained in self worth my achievements and goals have been easier to identify and recognise.\nWe grow up going through an education system that trains us to obtain the best academic results in order to earn the most money in the highest position within our chosen mainstream profession that we can. That our success in life is based on our future job title and wealth. We are offered ‘careers advice’ helping us choose between accountant, lawyer, builder, plumber, funeral director, engineer.\nMany people spend there entire life aspiring to reach the ‘next level’ step up the job title list, the recognition of higher salary bracket. They spend their life working towards future success.\nI believe I have managed to recognise and enjoy my current, present and real successes that exist in MY real world in the here and now.\nWhen I worked in society’s structured and measured world I was driven, not by money or title but by the people I worked with and who I did that work for. I have never (except in my first 3 months between education and work), been in a role that has made me unhappy. I have taken jobs based on the personality and ethos of the ‘people in power’, that is to say I have worked for people I admire and respect. I have worked hard for them because I wanted to ‘help’ their business, my motivator being ‘not wanting to let them down’ and ‘desire to deliver on my promise’. I’ve worked in roles where I at least have been motivated by the end result that matters.\nI’ll explain that more clearly. The business world is a bit like magic – its all smoke and mirrors. The reality is largely irrelevant, its all about the PERCEPTION. Take, for example the recruitment industry. To me success was getting a job seeker into a job they really wanted, finding a business the employer they really needed. To my employer the success was the commission rate and the income outcome of that transaction.\nI was, by default ‘successful’ in a real world sense. I was top earner, consultant of the year, I got promoted, I got promoted again.\nHowever, as much as the money was handy what motivated me was the new skills I learned, the confidence I gained, the customers I helped, and the thank you letters I received.\nI left the ‘real world’ when I could no longer balance the smoke and mirrors game and the time that took to uphold with MY need to feel good. It took a really long time to tire of it completely. My frustrations with the game often out-weighed by my desire to ‘achieve’ for the CEOs and MDs I admired and still admire (as individuals for the way they run their businesses and treat their staff). I guess I liked the pats on the back and the adulation. However, in the end the pointlessness of it all drove me forward.\nThis ‘real world’ success came at a price I wasn’t prepared to pay. Too many compromises in the time I had with my son, my husband, my friends, my hobbies. So whilst I was a success in a business sense I felt I was failing and compromisng in other areas.\nWhilst working and affording new things and driving nice cars and gaining kudos I was tormented by not having time to do homework with my son, being too tired to have a romantic dinner with my partner. Whilst working in this real world several things happened. A friend died of inoperable cancer at the age of 34, very successful sales and marketing manager , working all the hours . A colleague two years off retirement with plans to travel and climb mountains when he hit 65, dropped dead without warning. A friend split from her husband.\nJohn, my partner was very stressed with his job and the commuting. He also hated it. The office politics, the ladder climbing. It was taking its toll on our life. We were’ successful’ in this ‘real world’ – company cars, large house, the word ‘manager’ in our job titles. But it had no bearing on our real lives. We were tired of the pointlessness of it all. The smoke and mirrors bullshit.\nMy recent ‘toe dipping’ came as a result of wanting to support a person I respect and like. Who is achieving at a faster pace than the infrastructure around her is evolving to facilitate it. I wanted to offer her a little relief from the stress and I fancied learning a little more about whats going on in the big wide world.\nThe experience made me remember how much I hate the bullshit. People ‘liking’ you for what you can bring to THEIR success and wealth, a constant need to watch your back, keep an eye on the competition and remind people of your status. Suspicion, back stabbing, false praise. Your eye constantly on the prize. The prize; more financial wealth , higher social standing, bigger contacts, larger contracts. It might be for some. And that’s fine. But its not for me.\nSuccess for me is in the here and now. I have no savings, no spare cash, I drive an old car, my mortgage debt is through the roof, I wear clothes from charity shops and Primark, I think twice about everything I buy. I have, however achieved riches and success beyond my wildest dreams.\nIn my ‘alternative world’ I am as rich as I could hope to be. I have a partner of 20 years who loves me unconditionally , and I love him the same. I have a son who loves me; who is happy,well balanced and enjoying life. My house (my bank’s house!) looks out across mountains and fields with prancing lambs and budding trees. I live in a community filled with people who love me and of places where I can be me. I meet people every day who are here to have a good time and want to share a glimpse into their world. I paint and cut glass and share in a community of sole traders who revel in each others skills and strengths. I spend my days at home with my partner, and I’m here every day when my son comes home. My success is now. My happiness is in the present.\nSometimes I forget how successful I am, and I have a blip or downward spiral but real life, no matter how ‘perfect’ comes with its trials and challenges . The outside world gets in and you have to deal with it. However, on the whole I can truly say I have found my utopia.\nThere is no greater achievement in life than finding love, recognising its worth, enjoying the here and now, and being happy in your own skin. Measure your wealth by the people you love and who love you. Not by your bank balance and job title.\nI couldn’t agree more, my job doesn’t pay great but I earn enough to live on with little extras if I watch my spending, its a job I enjoy because I deal with children and I have all the school holidays off to spend with my husband and children, life is wonderful.\nLikeLike\nhi Teen, glad your life is good. We do miss you though xxxx\nLikeLike",

Two months of bulk cooking and freezing. Arranging accommodation,organising musicians , liaising with the venue.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_04_06_well-im-awake/content_1615.html": "Of course I bloody well am. Wide awake, mind racing at a hundred miles an hour, dredging up long-lost incidentals from my archives and chucking them onto the top of the ‘read now’ tray. So I’m lying in bed for two hours trying to concentrate on my breathing and sleeping and up pops the words of an old song, I find myself humming ” Red Light Spells Danger” Lala bloody la!. “Shut up” shouts my internal antagonist. “You must sleep.”\n“Stop chucking these random tunes into my head” my diminished other self screams back!\nThese days I am a self-employed lay-about and professional time waster (Artist and crafter is what I tell my partner). Mornings are not my strong point these days and my lifestyle is such that this matters very little. As such I generally sleep very well. Two exceptions: the night before a period; and the night before a time specific (relatively) early start. When both of these circumstances coincide my brain’s little joker starts up the “cataclysmic misdirection” protocol. The little devil opens files at random, filling the screen with pop ups and causing the “close all programs and shut down” protocol to fail “Error – Program not responding” messages cram my brain as I try to close down the open files. Its like I’ve kicked over the bloody trash bin and am desperately wishing I’d emptied it before it got so full.\nBeing an old version my brain doesn’t seem to have a “Ctrl/Alt/Del” function and demands an emergency download and full back up .\nHence I am sat here at 2amish downloading onto lists and calenders, creating hard copies of data ,basically performing a long-winded manual shut down. There is no way this bloody thing is going to be ready for a 7:30 reboot.\nAnyway it got me thinking. Firstly about why my life isn’t punctuated by songs that invoke very clear images (those of you who get this – like my parter, are very lucky). Then about the paintings I needed to hang at an exhibition in May and where to get new fittings to comply with the contract. Then I thought I needed the bathroom. Then started thinking I was hungry. Then searching the memory banks for the name of the guy I danced with at a certain nightclub 24years ago. Then that I need to make a note to call a gas engineer. Had I missed the deadline for planting early potatoes? What had I done with the car keys? What should I get my partner for our 20th anniversary? What was I going to wear in the morning -the list of random shit goes on and on coupled with the random playlist which includes “Jingle Bells” (its April!), and a nice bit of Human League and that bit of classical music that was ruined by that chocolate bar advert. You know the one “Everyone’s a fruit a nut case…” (well they’re not wrong there!)\nIn case you were wondering, the guy – the one I danced with – his name was Paul Cushing (“Hi” if you happen to be reading – I am slightly embarrassed now).\nAnyway, last week I actually dreamt that I couldn’t sleep ……….",

Hubby referred to it as my birthday year.\nPresents from Hubby arrived sporadically and with excited squeals of delight and surprise from me throughout the year …it was all very exciting.\nThen there was the party planning. Although most of it was dealt with by Hubby and his team of delegates, I was privvy to snippets and had access to the private party page on FB so I new who was saying they could come and was able to “e-squeal”, every time I got overly excited thinking about it\nI must be the most fortunate woman alive. The amount of love and energy that was poured into that party weekend that overflowed into the whole of the following week, throughout the following weekend and trickled into the next few days. Friends from near and far; loads of live music, laughter, chat, dancing, hugging and drinkng.\nI have never ever seen so many wonderful gifts and cards. I love receiving actual cards. I received about 55 of them and I shall keep and treasure them all. The flow of pink gifts was astounding. Pink wine, pink blankets, pink gin, pink gloves, pink hats and scarves, punk vodka, pink balloons…. A beautiful sight. And everyone seemed to get my message about my view on cut flowers. Not one. But I think I have a bit of a reputation for a drink !!! Honestly I need another fridge to house the champagne, prosecco, wine etc etc. (Must add at this point that I am not complaining at all)..\nRecovering now at the beginning of my 51st year. Feeling immensely positive about the future.\nSomeone said to me “here’s to the next half century”, personally I doubt that I’ll make the century the way this body is abused! However, I shall aim to continue to live every day with an open heart and mind and grab every opportunity that presents itself with open arms.\nThat just leaves me to, once again, thank every single person I know and love for helping me celebrate and making my life fuller than it would be if any of them were absent from it. I love you all.\nThat cake! Wow! Happy birthday – I’m glad you had such a wonderful time 🙂 #dreamteam\nLikeLike\nHappy birthday! I’m approaching the big 40 and I’m loving the idea of a birthday year! So pleased you’ve had a wonderful time celebrating. Thanks for linking to #DreamTeam x\nLikeLike\nWow, sounds like a fabulous celebration and you are clearly loved very dearly by many people.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2018_03_10_because-youre-worth-it/content_12.html": "I consider myself a pretty open, kind, friendly person. Not meaning to big myself up but I would say I’m the type of person that not only is compelled to advocate for those unable or unwilling to defend themselves but also the type of friend, whose aim it is to improve your day, help you feel better about yourself or your situation and generally give you a life ‘leg up’.\nI’m not saying that I’m special or unique in this, I have great friends and acquaintances who will brighten my day; bolster my ego; help me believe in myself; lift me up when I fall; even scrape me off the ground and help fix me when I’m broken.\nWhen I can I aim to live a life ‘paying it forward’. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think I’m some sort of saint. I definitely have wicked thoughts; times when I might wish ill on a person (criminals, politicians, arseholes, wankers… those sorts of people…), but generally I think I live altruistically and in consideration of others. And to be honest, it’s almost a selfish thing, because living this way makes my own life better. Yes, maybe it is just about me(!).\nLiving like this can start with small things like a smile; an offer to help with a bag; a comment about a nice pair of shoes someones wearing; a coffee for a homeless person; a queue jump for someone with only a couple of items… nothing earth shattering just common courtesy and human consideration\nThere have been times in my life when I have felt helpless and hopeless: worthless even. In those times I have had many great and varied friends who have helped me. One friend would just come and sit in companionable silence with me doing her sewing or knitting; others would take on small tasks; some would send a card with a comical or meaningful message; the odd phone call; an invitation for coffee. Basically they were kind and considerate. When people provide some of their precious time for you – be it a whole day or just a fleeting moment; they are seeing you, and at those rock bottom times in life where you feel worthless or invisible those fleeting moments can carry you through a day.\nI am sure that those who gave of themselves to me benefitted from doing so. I know I feel great if I can make someone smile, cheer someone up or help them out. We are social animals, we work best in communities. As women our nature is to nurture. Happily for me, I’m a natural at it, I’m almost addicted to it.\nWe all need our friends and family to remind us how extraordinary we each are. Sometimes we need to dip in and take from the pool of strength and support; other times we pour into it.\nKindness and empathy, what the world needs now. #LGRTstumble xox\nLikeLike\nI have a few people in my life who lift me up when I really need it and others who just by being near them, cheers me up. I think that wanting to lift others is a wonderful thing. I do that for the ones I love all the time. It does make my life so much better when I lift up deserving people who also lift me up as well:) #Globalblogging\nLikeLike\nI don’t know where I would be without my friends! I count myself very lucky to have them. Thanks for linking up to #ablogginggoodtime!\nLikeLike\nThis is a really feel good post, I’d like to think I’m there for people in the way you’ve described #LGRTStumble\nLikeLike\nThere’s so much here that is true and good — and risky.\nAnd that’s the crux of living given. We lose control of our time and even our hearts, but we gain so much more.\nLikeLike\nthat’s such a lovely way to be and you are not only making others happy, in doing so you are making yourself happy too. x\n#LGRTStumble\nLikeLike\nBeautiful. Kindness just needs us to pause and notice that someone needs it. Love this.\nLikeLike",

I had a clear path I needed to walk in order to reach my goal\n1. I need to use twitter lists more effectively\n2. I need to monetize (I hate that word) my blog\nSo I started reading blogs and posts about these things. They all made sense until I tried to action the points.

I now have a ‘premium’ site (only as of today) so I can apparently do a lot more. For example I can customise my CSS! ???\nSo now I need to also know what the f** k my CSS even is! How did I live without it and what do I do with it now I have it? So I follow a hyperlink which tells me how easy it is and leads to another and another hyperlink of information. I’ve lost the tab I originally had open. I’m lost\nI also discovered I would benefit from StumbledUpon. Does this premium WordPress account allow this? I think not, maybe? Maybe I need a business account to ‘Stumble’? I haven’t even got to grips with this plan.\nBut now I also need to learn how to use and find time to regularly engage with ‘StumbledUpon’ …I’ve set up an account….\nI discovered that there are several ways to ‘monetize’ (yep still hate it)… I can ‘affiliate’… now I need to learn what and how to affiliate myself… I joined a couple of ‘Influencer’ sites but I think they’re USA based and I really want something in the UK (or do I?)\nI can engage in pay-per-click.

At what rate should I offer it?\nI am told I need to set up Google Analytics… I thought I had. I tried to link my blog… there are no stats for my blog. I have to add some code to my blog – cut and paste, very simple… where the f**k do I put it in WordPress?\nI think I need the icons for the linkys I’m part of on a side bar… how do I create a new side bar. were do I put the code?\nThe more I read the more questions I have. The more I realise I need. The more I realise I don’t know. The more my confidence dwindles. The more my frustration rises. The more time I lose. The more I realise I don’t even know what questions to ask or even what answers I need.\nI have so much part information in my head I feel like I might explode. I’m flitting from one thing I must do to move forward to another . I am a rabbit in the headlights.\nI’m missing a trick or three but I don’t even know where to begin to look for them\nI’m not stupid but I feel like a complete moron. Am I really as inept as all of this is making me feel?\nIn forward offered gratitude, with mental desperation and feeling decidedly thick and useless; I am offering the one thing I am confident at being able to offer at its best. A weekend away for 2 at my beautiful, cosy B&B in the Heart of Wales . In exchange all I ask is for a couple or 3 hours of expert one to one guidance with my WordPress blog and maybe a little bit of advice on better using Twitter. I know I’m missing something(s) but I don’t know what they are.\nPS: I have wine….and gin\nI have been there and stepping back helps me. I also think to stumble upon is brilliant to get traffic to your blog, however, I do have to do manually.However, I am used to it now and it is automatic X #anythinggoes\nLikeLike\nthanks for being supportive x. I’ve stepped away for a couple of days and am less frustrated (probably because I’m not trying to do it!)\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nHi Berni, I can help you with many things you are mentioning in this post. I used to be a WordPress developer and I have very good technical skills (I know HTML, CSS and PHP) but I’ve also worked in marketing for the past 5 years so I am well versed in SEO, PPC (pay-per-click) and marketing analysis. I think the best is to get in touch with me via email, telling me a little bit more about your goals, what you are trying to achieve and just give me as much information as possible. Here is my email: petra@behealthynow.co.uk\nPetra\nLikeLike\njust emailed you. Many thanks xxxx\nLikeLike\nI thought I needed all those things but they stressed me out just thinking about them. I decided whatever makes me feel contracted and tense I’m not going to do! It’s tough and I wish you luck. BTW I gave myself a heart attack trying to be perfect at the end of last year. Makes you rethink what you really need. Anita\nLikeLike\nomg Anita.. Hope you are recovered/ recovering. What a terrifying thing to happen. normally I’m very chilled and rose-tinted. Its only when i step away from running my B&B, making lovely glass things and reading/writing blogs; in order to try and raise awareness, market and make a living from them that my patience and confidence are tested xxxx thanks for commenting. xxx\nLikeLike\nHeya! CSS is basically coding for your side and how you can customise it. I would definitely recommend finding someone who can make you a customised CSS site. Also, I was really worried about my services page like I offer 3 for those wanting it but it doesn’t really matter how much you put on the page just so people know you offer something. If you want help, you can email me: katy_mackenzie@yahoo and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have!\nLikeLike\nHi Katy. Will ping you an email it will come from Cerdyn Villa (my B&B ). thanks for your time.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nOkay no worries!\nLikeLike",

Before we’d so much as allowed the kettle to boil, sat down and exchanged the usual niceties: “so good to see you”; ” don’t you look well!”; “its been too long!”; “hows the family”. Before the steaming mug of traditional welcoming hot beverage was in our hands came the sentence ” Haven’t you put on weight, you had lost so much on that diet when we last saw you” (coupled with a friendly pat on my love handles and a sympathetic smile as if it was necessary to show concern at my lapse of self-control).\nI was thrown, I shouldn’t have been as there are several people of the same generation whose life is generally controlled by etiquette, decorum and social pleasantries, whose manners slip into this common insult in the name of familiarity and concern.\nOK, I have put on a bit of weight. i LIKE social drinking and dinner parties; food festivals and wine & nibbles with a movie. I’m a size 14 – not exactly an elephant – but even if I was, what is it with the older generation that prompts this Tourette’s like behaviour born of familiarity?\nAnyway , it got be thinking about etiquette and ‘old-fashioned’ good manners. (even that phrase is saddening – why are good manners old-fashioned?). I love a bit of old-fashioned pomp, respect and courtesy. Holding open doors; giving way; pleases and thank you s. A hand written letter of acknowledgement for a gift etc. Recently I was at a local agricultural show and it was lovely to see all the class judges in bowler hats and tweed jackets. It was really something to enjoy a spot of tradition.\nI used to have this lovely elderly gentleman visit me in my shop. His name was Chris, and when he visited me he always wore his blazer and medals. Before I knew him I referred to him as ‘Sir’. When we spoke I would always comment on how ‘dapper’ he looked. I generally great an elderly man as ‘Sir’, generally I use it in line with that generation who have reached the point where they are boasting about their age. I still remember feeling old the first time a shop keeping called me Madam instead of Miss – these common courtesies can fall on a minefield of personal insecurities if not handled with care! I was, despite his good manners, devastated at the realisation that I was considered (relatively) old.\nI love it when my sons friends greet me or thank me . But that in itself surely suggests it’s no longer the norm. To be thanked for having them or for the meal you’ve cooked, or for the lift – it goes without saying, surely, that a ‘thank you’ is in order.\nI would like to think my son will always be thoughtful enough and polite enough to say please and thank you, acknowledge a letter or gift and hold open a door if someone has their hands full. (I hope the same for my husband!) But at what age, as a mother, should I just assume i have instilled the good manners and leave him to make his own choices. Once hes married or living with someone else should I really still phone him to remind him to thank his grandmother for the Christmas present or to not forget his sisters/brothers/uncles birthday/anniversary/graduation?! These are choices and behaviours we all have to take our own responsibility for. And, as a result, the consequences for if we fail to deliver and subsequently offend.\nAs frustrating as this may be, we raise our children to be independent and in all other things we leave them to do so, so why interfere when it comes to our own take on social etiquette? Only this year I found myself berating John’s older boys for not making some sort of contact with their father on Fathers Day. I was cross with myself immediately after. They are both grown and in relationships. If they choose to not see it as important, not want to do it, that is their choice, not mine. John will decide if he is offended or not and comment, or not, himself. As it was, the offense and etiquette issues were mine. John, I’m pretty sure, wasn’t bothered as that’s not what they do and I am sure both boys girlfriends saw me as an interfering old bag!! Touche – been there done that.\nHowever, there are occasions where you wonder where the cut off should be. On one occasion having received a gift, I wrote a letter of thanks and updated the recipient on the latest goings on in the Crompton/Benton household. A week later I received a very nice letter thanking me for thanking her. For a moment I did consider sending a “thank you for thanking me for thanking you” letter. Too much perhaps?\nAnyway, ‘thank you’ all SO much for reading, following and/or commenting on my blog posts. Your input is most appreciated and I hope to hear from you all in the near future.\nxxxx\nI don’t do thank you notes (although a quick text or email will be sent if I won’t be seeing the person in the flesh in the next few days), but I think manners are so important – it’s important to be grateful to others for going out of their way to help you. #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nPolite manners are an absolute delight to witness. I think that over the years, people just get busy and worn down with life and things get pushed to the way-side, unfortunately. Manners are something that is to be taught from a young age, as well as what is considered rude or not.\n#BlogCrush\nKatelynn, hampersandhiccups.com\nLikeLike\nMy mum always brought me up to have good manners. I do get offended when people don’t say please and thank you. Manners cost nothing after all! Iust confess I’m pretty bad at getting D to write thank you notes but we make a point of at least sending a shirt video message saying thank you! #blogcrush\nLikeLike",

The senseless death of an innocent, vibrant young woman (mother, daughter, career woman, carer, ambassador, advocate), shocked me beyond words. The images of her with her children brought me to tears. The words of her husband broke my heart.\nThis morning I feel sick to the stomach. This senseless, tragic death has become the advertising board for the average Brexit voter. Jo Cox, peace keeper, humanitarian. What would she think of us all? She has, overnight become an excuse for hate and a political shit covered stick with which to beat 50% of the population.\nThe Referendum is simply a UK wide OPINION POLE. The result, unless it’s Remain, is unlikely to bring forth any government change that will result in a Brexit. At best a large vote or a majority vote for Brexit will cause a much needed shake up in UK politics and EU structure. But, based on the fact that no Brexit plans have been revealed to back up a political (as opposed to race hate) campaign, suggests that there are no plans to follow through on a Brexit vote if that’s what the referendum (opinion poll ) suggests.\nWhen the Referendum first began, I was (and still am ) a Brexiter. However. This is a MASSIVE HOWEVER. Brexit campaign has been commandeered as a race hate, xenophobic, fascist platform. I can’t imagine that the majority of Brexit-to-be-Voters ever wanted or expected this. For me it’s never been about immigrants. But the campaign has come to represent ONLY immigration and race hate. Honest, honourable, humanitarian, Brexit campaigners have been drowned out by a collective VoteRemain spin and an extremist VoteLeave front man, Nigel Farage .\nAnd now poor Jo Cox, whose life was dedicated to peace and humanitarian causes has become, overnight, the ‘evidence’ of a divided, race hating Britain.\nI am sick. Sick to the stomach of what we have all become since we were offered a referendum. On both sides we have become savages. I place some of the blame on the politicians, much of it on the media. But as human beings I blame most of it squarely on the shoulders of each and every one of us . Every individual who has lost sight of the facts and leapt onto the hate and spin bandwagon.\nShame on the people of the UK. Shame on the people of Europe and the world who are choosing to add fuel to the fire. Shame on us ALL\nJo Cox; Human Being, Woman, Mother, Wife, Daughter may your memory cease to be tarred with anything other than your goodness and kindness . RIP\nTruly a tragic and senseless tragedy. We, in the U.S. can relate to that with our recent tragedy.\nLikeLike\nthe attack in Orlando was terrifying and tragic. sadly attacks and tragic accidents involving guns happen too often in the USA – we in the UK can’t understand the lack of gun control implimentation , Every other danger that presents itself is resolved with new H&S or risk management plans. Hooray for the filibustering that went on in the Senate last week. Thank fully here in the UK gun crime and accidents are very rare\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nSome of us here can’t understand the lack of gun control either. Many of the politicians in Washington get large contributions from the gun manufacturers so that it won’t happen.\nLikeLike\n“Every individual who has lost sight of the facts and leapt onto the hate and spin bandwagon….”\nNobody has lost sight of the facts, for the simple reason that nobody has been given any facts… just loads of opposing predictions, suppositions, scaremongering and chest-thumping. Facts would be lovely, so the masses have at least a chance of in informed choice.\nLikeLike\nthat is true – we have no facts. We have no details of the plan you would assume would be in place if they planned to follow through on a Brexit vote. We have no idea how the EU , Europe and the British Parliament will act and what will be implemented after this vitriolic, divisive and downright horible and (i suspect, pointless) referendum. What is clear is that feelings are strong, political engagement is high and all our heads are being filled with dangerous propoganda and bullshit – thats both sides. And now THIS\nLikeLike\nDear Berni,\nFirstly, thank you. You’ve tackled many difficult topics on your blog and you always do so with honesty and writing from your heart.\nThis is a tragic day and I do feel a sense of shared responsibility for the death of Jo Cox and the general tone of hate in our country.\nAs you know, you and I have differing views on very few things; the EU referendum is actually the only thing I can think of where we have differing opinions. And I love that we listen to each other, respect the fact that because we have different thoughts does not weaken our friendship or make me love you any less.\nThe overwhelming opinion has been taken, on both sides, by the extremists. I feel shame at how every side has used anger, hate, lies and speculation to attempt to scare us into a result that suits them.\nThe loss of an MP scares me too; what are we becoming when a member of our parliament, there to represent us, is killed on the street? And when I think of her husband and children, my grief overwhelms.\nWhat a fitting tribute it would be to Jo if the tone of British politics took a turn, learned to educate and explain with facts, engage in real debate not shouting and drowing-out, but respect and celebration of the fact we can voice our opinions, take steps towards change and make our country a better place, for everyone who lives in it.\nWith love\nDinah x\nLikeLike\nhear hear, D. thank you xxxxxx\nLikeLike",

I’d been a king, a handsome prince, a wicked witch, and a blue genie with gold wings. I have a new little friend, a reminder of playing without self-consciousness and a wonderful flashback to when my own son was three.\nWe had some amazing adventure together Jason and I. Plus we built some of the BEST snowmen (I’ll have to dig out an old photo).\nChildren don’t need lots of money spent on expensive toys, moulded plastic in bright primary colours. They need an old box, maybe a scatter cushion or two, access to your heart and time, and the freedom to allow their imaginations to work their magic.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_04_04_the-dreaded-d-word/content_1117.html": "I refer, of course to D I E T\nA four letter word that is offensive, upsetting, disappointing, obsessive, demeaning. A word that more often than not, in all its four letter innocence, leads to failure and disappointment. A word that has made a few people millions. A word that has left millions of women (and men) fatter than they began.\nIts a word that sounds simple yet is complex beyond belief; a word that promises easy solutions and delivers lies and shattered hopes.\nOver the years (say from aged 18 to now – which is a few decades) I have only ever lost weight twice. The first occasion I was already a willowy teenager with little spare flesh anyway but I had gastric flu and couldn’t hold anything down for a week. The balance quickly restored as my health returned. The second time was two years ago when I believed I had found the easy solution in the capable hand of Dr Eades and his multi-million pound best seller “How to Lose your Middle Aged Middle”. I lost a stone and a half. I regained two stone.\nThat’s the issue with these diet- Weight Watchers, Slimming World, Atkins, Cabbage Soup, Grapefruit, Boiled Egg, Feast & Fast, Low Carb, Low Fat….. they work if you don’t cheat. They don’t always provide a pleasant lifestyle eating solution for the future. They are a chore, they rely on you eating differently from the rest of your family, They make it nearly impossible to enjoy social gatherings. Protein shakes, weighing everything, special packets, unsociable flatulence!! Whatever diet undertaken, it will have its rules. My diet two years ago made me (and hubby) completely anti social. At the time it only succeeded because my partner was doing it too. and, to be honest, at the time, I did for the first time ever think ” this is easy, why can’t everyone do it”. In hindsight, it was completely unsustainable. We didn’t go to friends houses as there was nothing we could eat at a vegetarian dinner party. We weren’t drinking anything, not even a cup of tea . going to the pub was a bore and a temptation, No cafe, restaurant, hotel, party, coffee morning. We pretty much stayed at home.\nWhen I went back to weekend treats and social eating the weight piled back on and then super ceded the original start point.\nThe facts are that most of us love food, social eating, parties etc. Most diets in reality are a chore, Most diets are doomed to failure, if not at the time then after they finish. Statistically, I read, the majority of people who engage in a diet gain more weight after the diet than they lost during it.\nDiets lie. I read an interesting, humourous article in (dare i say it) the Daily Mail’s “Femail” section this week (also printed in Good Housekeeping). The article could have been written by me, it was like the words were falling from my own mouth. Entitled “Can’t lose weight? How pathetic. You just need willpower”. The title got my back up initially and I wasn’t going to read it. I’m glad I did. Carol Sarler, knew the diet lies. She knew that most diets meant being hungry at times, eating things you don’t like, tasteless food, self denial and misery.\nShe said the words that we all know and we all are too scared to speak. The only way to lose weight is with willpower. Whether using a diet and helping fill the coffers of the diet gurus or by reducing your own intake. You will at times feel hungry and you will have to accept that.\nShe also said the other thing that we all choose to ignore. Diet gurus make us stupid. We all know that a fried potato is worse for you than a lettuce leaf or even a boiled potato. We all know that a cake is fattening, that half a broken biscuit when no-ones looking is cheating.\nThe only real way to lose and maintain weight loss is to really want to do it and really have the willpower to do so. It can only happen through consuming less calories than you use. Which means that you will, almost certainly , at times feel hungry and have to choose not to satisfy that hunger. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.\nIf you are one of the lucky few who can follow and is happy to follow a ‘guru-led’ diet then lucky you. Well done for you willpower, congratulations on your weight loss and long may you be at your achieved goal weight. You are one of the rare few.\nIf you are one of the many millions who diet unwillingly to comply with social stereotypes and media imagery telling you that your perfectly healthy size 12/14 body is ugly, then I beg you to stop and look instead at what is making you unhappy to be you.\nIf however, you are like me, one of the many many millions of people who, if honest with ourselves know we overeat, cheat and lie to ourselves, fool ourselves, then our only answer is going to come from within. We have an unhealthy relationship with food, whether we admit it or not. And deep down we know our weight is affecting our health. I don’t have a simple solution. I don’t actually have any solution; I can only sympathise. I have no easy answer and neither did Carol Sarler. I am still overweight myself.\nWe are so entrenched in our unhealthy relationships that no amount of bad knees, backache, failing joints, acid reflux, pending diabetes worry ,misery over our own self image; will make losing our excess weight any easier.\nWe are not amongst the rich and famous with our personal dietician, chef, trainer. Even our healthcare system doesn’t support us. How many of us have been to the doctors (whilst overweight if we were truly honest with ourselves) for back ache, bad knees or hips, breathing problems, digestive problems and been treated for the symptoms? However, shouldn’t they have discussed with us the cause, made us face up to our various food obsessions, been able to offer us some dietary support? Dealt with us holistically?\nI can take acid reflux medication for my whole life but surely I would be better off eating more healthily and dropping a couple of stone. I’m sure my health problems would be relinquished if I did that. However so damaged are our psyches that we live in denial, our subconscious selecting to ignore the real and obvious facts and real and obvious solution. That is that we would alleviate our symptoms if we ate different amounts of food and didn’t weight so much.\nIs it politically incorrect to say such a thing.? I wonder how many of us are on life long medications and have both minor and serious illnesses that would be alleviated or even disappear completely, if we could control our weight. I wonder with even more alarm, how many of us undergo surgery rather than accept with honesty that are symptoms are largely exacerbated by our weight. We have such an unhealthy relationship with our eating habits that we even ‘go under the knife’ instead of facing reality. So entrenched is our national bad relationship with food and our collective unwillingness to face up to it. How much, I wonder does this denial cost our NHS. How much does it cost us as individuals? What is the cost to our families, our quality of life, our enjoyment of old age? We live a long time these days. I want my later years to be active, exciting, mobile. Do I want it enough to face my demon, and face the only truth that will get me there. The answer can only come from within, but I have not yet found the way to tap it. And neither have the majority of us.\nThis is the ONLY TRUTH and everything else is only fooling myself:\n” I am overweight because I consume more calories than I use & I need to find the willpower to stop for the benefit of my health and my future”",

I hadn’t been there for quite a while as I’d got in quite a mess last time I tried even though I’d managed and even enjoyed it many times prior. It’s easy to navigate going forward, slightly uphill and a bit narrow in places, but straightforward.\nIt’s just about negotiable for me in reverse. The road was fine, even though the weather was a bit grey. I made it to the destination, did what needed to be done. But by the end of the day it was dark, and wet and miserable. I misjudged the kink in the slope and ended up with two wheels on boggy ground. I tried to move forward to get out of the mess but i was stuck so i moved a bit further back in an attempt to extricate myself. By then i was pretty much sliding around and getting nowhere. I still had two wheels in sight of solid ground but they had no purchase. I could not get a grip. I was well and truly bogged down. The car was stranded. I turned everything off, locked the doors and left it alone. It was too dark to do anything but sleep.\nThe next day it wasn’t so wet and grey. I realised needed some people with more strength and the right tools to help me out. It may have been a bit too late before i recognised i was getting myself more struck but once I asked for help it came.\nThe car is safely home. Its pretty muddy and got a few bruises but its back on the road. I’m pretty sure when i next drive it everything will work as normal.\nThanks to a few friends, and their time and support, I’m back on the road. Parked. But on solid ground.",

Sound track available as a download from ‘scribbleman’.\nBrecon in Mid Wales saw the world premiere of Greed at Coliseum Cinema last night (Monday April 10).\nA sold-out invited audience were ironically glammed up for the politically zeitgeist movie, which has won two film festival global awards already.\nGreed was shot in Brecon and Aberdare in 2016 on a micro budget – no budget actually. The cross-generational cast (with actors between 14 and 74 years old) are mostly residents of Brecon, a town struggling in these challenging austerity times.\nIt’s subversive, it’s anti-establishment, it’s a musical. It’s Welsh and like nothing else.\nGreed writer and director Nigel Evans says: “Greed has done okay so far with film awards from the Monkey Bread Tree Film Awards in London and the Monthly International Film Awards in Copenhagen.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_02_22_my-mate-ted/content_2098.html": "As a self-employed person and home worker (amateur artist, B&B proprietor) there is a tendency to spend a great deal of time alone.\nIt took me a good year to adjust to not having my little craft shop and its slow but steady flow of friends and visitors who came in for a chat, free cuppa and occasionally to shop (!!). I was also a proactive member of many groups and a bit of a political activist within local politics.\nI resolved this year to step back. So, whilst I still keep abreast of all the groups and politics , this year , unless I really have to, I have no intention of attending a single meeting or demonstration. Although I can’t promise not to send a stern letter or email or make the odd controversial statement on FB or twitter! Those who are friends will be relieved. Others who know me may well sigh at this point.\nAnyway, I have finally got myself very comfortably ensconced in being ‘out of the loop’ and reclusive at my work bench.\nQuite often I enjoy the silence but more and more frequently I spend my time with TED.\nThat is to say I tune my computer to TED talks. TED standing for Technology, Entertainment and Design. Tag line “Ideas Worth Spreading”. Initially I would listen to talks that reflected the opinions I already had but then I started picking random playlists: design, technology, art, evolution, creationism, humanism, atheism, social change, scientific development, psychology, education, health and debates. Everything is there.\nI’ve laughed, cried, been motivated and astounded. I’ve gained knowledge, grown opinion, discovered great people, had views affirmed, been surprised and occasionally been horrified. Some talks and debates have been so surprising, funny, or inspirational I’ve already shared them with certain people I thought might enjoy them, via FB.\nI’m off on my holidays tomorrow I shall be taking myself ‘off grid’ for the duration. No phone, no computer, no internet, Nada. It’ll be great.\nAnyway, I didn’t want you to miss me too much (yeah right!) – especially those of you who talk to me via the other social media channels. So, I am sharing with you my favourite TED Talks to date. With a little reason why so when you listen you can think of me crying or laughing, shouting at the computer, or dancing round the studio. If you listen to TED or similar yourself you might have something you want to share back. Please do, I often pick the talks that come by various recommendations and go off from there.\nHere are my favourite eight to date – one for every day I’m away! If you listen to the whole lot it will take you less than two hours (and note – I have not included controversial anti-religion, pro atheism talks although some do assume a basic acceptance of the earth being billions of years old and the acceptance of evolution.)\nEnjoy .\nJill Bolte Taylor – My stroke of Insight – (19 minutes) powerful, emotional and insightful. Jill is a brain scientist and she herself had a stroke and this provides a detailed insight into what goes on during a stroke mentally, emotionally, medically and practically. I cried.\nNeil Harbisson – I listen to colour – (10 minutes) Neil is colourblind. Completely. He’s also an artist. He HEARS colour in notes, cords, harmonics and discords. He can now dream in colour and has favourites but in the most beautifully creative way you can imagine. He “used to dress in a way that looked good, now he dresses in a way that sounds good”, for the talk he is dressed in C Major.\nJuan Enriques – The Next Species of Human – (19 minutes) a very comical yet startling look at the problems with the economy, consumerism and the banking crisis (OK this talk is about the goings on in America and we’re here in the UK – but still relevant comparison); and bioengineering taking us forward into the not too distant future. Great images, poignant points, amazing technical advances in medicine. It’ll amaze you, make you laugh and think .\nLee Cronin – Making Matter Come Alive -(15 minutes) evolution, chemistry, and the amazing possibilities of life. What can I say? Lee is an inorganic chemist and he’s talking about ‘inorganic biology’ – this talk puts ‘biology in its place’. Eighteen minutes of jaw dropping possibilities about life and evolution that will change the way you look at life as you currently know it.\nKen Robinson – How Schools Kill Creativity – (19 minutes) Nurturing creativity. It’s really funny and will make you smile and laugh whilst questioning the way we ‘educate’ and prepare the next generation. He’s animated, articulate and thought-provoking. “….Professors look at their bodies as a form of transport for their heads – they are a way of getting their heads to meetings..”\nJill Sweeney – Its Time for the Talk – (5 minutes) – it’s just hilarious. If you have kids and have dealt with sex education this will make you cry laughing\nShea Hembrey How I Became 100 Artists – (17 minutes) what a talented man . Beautifully visual talk. An explosion of creativity.\nFrank Warren – Half a Million Secrets -(11 minutes) it started with a crazy idea where he printed out 1000 blank postcards with instructions on one side asking people to share a secret. the idea went viral. He founded PostSecret.com. Its awesome, emotional and life affirming\n❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤",

I laugh heartily; love wholely and live completely. I write what I think. Sometimes its fun, sometimes its political, sometimes its frustration, or angst. Always its real and heartfelt.\nI now live in Mid Wales having found a home with my family (John, my parner and Jason, our son) here in Llanwrtyd Wells where everyday eccentricity is celebrated. a place in the UK that attracts those from outside the mainstream and has created an identity based on its quirkiness.

How do you react when you pass a homeless person?\nAvoid eye contact? Feel embarrassed? Feel helpless? Offer a sympathetic glance? Cross the street? Give cash? Strike up a conversation? Report him/her? Buy him a coffee? Feel offended?\nToday I had the luxury of two hours of time-wasting and coffee drinking with my partner in central Cardiff before an appointment. We were strolling along happy and carefree. Laughing I expect. Holding hands. A young lad, maybe in his mid 20’s is sat on a dirty duvet in a shop doorway. Rucksack by his side, blanket on his legs. Teardrop tattoo by his right eye. He looks sad. Freezing.\nBy the time I see him I am in the process of crossing the road away from him. I catch myself looking at him and turn away… I’m embarrassed. It looks like (to whom I don’t know), I’m crossing the road to avoid him. My mood changes. I feel sad. Helpless. Embarrassed. I tell my partner I want to go and get him something warm. We turn around and walk back to the market. I avoid eye contact with the pathetic looking lad.\nHaving purchased a cup of hot soup we head back. I say to John, “what if loads of people have bought him food or drink and he doesn’t want it”\n“At least it will keep his hands warm for a bit” says John, “but I doubt it”.\nPoor lad, sat there in the drizzle, a lost soul, invisible in the commercial, consumerist chaos and greed surrounding him. I feel guilty for the money I spent on a meal out the evening before.\n“You look freezing love, here’s something to warm you up”\nHe looks terribly sad and quite confused. Has he been crying? “My mum’s just died” he says\nI ask how he knows.\n“I go to the library every Monday and use the public phone”\nWe continue to chat. Another person arrives and hands him a roll and a coffee. Asks if she can help.\nI don’t know if his story is true. I don’t even know if he knows. But I’m told his mum has died since his last call. His son is at school, he doesn’t know what to say to him. His mum is his son’s legal guardian. He’d been in prison because of some incident of violence and he needs to get to Caerphilly where his mum and son are. He tells me he asked the police to take him there but they told him not to waste their time.\nSo. What should you, or would you, do at this point? More cash? Some sympathy? Walk away? Find a policeman? We don’t know how to react do we? We’re not trained for this. There’s no manual we can refer to.\nI offered to take him to the station and buy him a ticket. In my mind this is the obvious solution. I would have ‘done my bit’, I could feel right with the world again. I am so saddened by my helplessness in the situation and of his plight. It’s embarrassing to admit it makes me feel uncomfortable and its put a bit of a damper on my day.\nAnyway, it’s all too much for him. He can’t get his head around his options. He thinks he should stay put for a bit and try to get some money. Talk to his aunt who’ll be by after schools out. As I said before, he’s confused. Whether or not the story is real is irrelevant, he believes it and his heart is breaking. Well mine is.\nSo? What would you do now? Say ‘Ok’ and move on? Try and persuade him that your help is the right option? Report him? Give money? What is the etiquette here?\nI offer to come back in an hour with the car and if he wants a lift and a ticket I’d get him one.\nAs we walk off he calls after us ” you will come back and check won’t you?” “Of course”, says I. “I promise”.\nI wonder at the chain of life events that has resulted in this point of time. At the pain and sadness, trials and tribulations he and his family and friends may have endured. A small part of me is angered by this negative intrusion into my rose-tinted world. Another small part of me is ashamed of that.\nWe do go back. I have John driving down the taxi only lanes and parking in the disabled bay so I can get to near him. So he can see the offer is genuine. Its been about 40 minutes since the food, soup, coffee, chat.\nBut he doesn’t think he should come. Not yet. He should wait. Who knows what for. I’m sure he is struggling to grasp his thoughts. I’m not sure about his reality. I want to give him a cwtch. Should I? All I can think about is how vulnerable and small he looks. I hesitate. But I don’t offer the cuddle. I also don’t offer cash. Even though he asks for the latter.\nI’m reluctant, but I walk off back to the car. “Thanks anyway” he calls.\nI wish I’d offered the cwtch. I wonder what he’d have done with the cash.",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_01_22_thank-god-im-an-atheist/content_1286.html": "Interesting isn’t it.\nMy last blog in which I openly discussed my beliefs, ie: my conviction in my understanding that there is no one true god, or collection/selection of Gods, or a creator/supreme being; has created more response than any other blog to date.\nIt’s a subject that can divides Nations and drive people to war. For me it creates interesting discussion. Well interesting discussion amongst mainly amongst Atheists but generally, from those with a ‘God’, almost no discussion at all. It truly is ‘blind faith’. A ll the conflicting and hypocritical bits in their respective ‘book of rules’; changes in which God; number of different Gods; choices of which bits of the ‘rule book’ to ignore because they no longer suit modern society, etc, become non-issues and are points of zero discussion in the eyes of the ‘faithful’. The Bible, Koran, Torah; in huge chunks (although I accept I have not read all of any of them) will openly marginalise women, oppose homosexuality, encourage the harsh punishment of children and rule breakers etc etc. Ancient religions (which the current faithful dismiss now as ridiculous) encouraged sacrifice, multiple god worship etc.\nI find the ability to believe , irrespective of education , science, and the continuous changing and bending of the order of the faith, absolutely fascinating. I have friends who are Buddhist, Creationist, Catholic, Baptist, Pagan, Wicca, Atheists, Agnostics, Humanist. Those I have known since young generally, if they have a ‘God’, have the one indoctrinated in them by their family or school. Many lost their belief about the same time as they realised that Father Christmas was a sentiment rather than a reality.\nI don’t ever remember believing in a God; I do remember the pain of Jewish Sunday School and the conflicts in our household to keep up the pretense to avoid confrontation with grandparents/aunts/uncles. My parents may remember differently. I do remember believing in Santa. And the Tooth Fairy. I believed in them because my parents told me they were real and society collectively kept the illusion alive. Then, as I grew older I realised that it wasn’t a ‘lie’ as such but a ‘fable’, a ‘sentiment’ and it retained and still retains a ‘magic’ for the joining together and joy it brings within the western world. But the ‘individual’ , ie: the actual ‘Santa’ is not real. the stories are based around folk-lore and stories passed down the generations as a way to promote a certain behaviour within society.\nWhen our son was a child we raised him to have an open mind. We told him that different people believed in different things and they couldn’t possibly all be ‘right’; that he should listen to all the different views and make his own choice. Whatever choice he made would be the right choice.\nOne of his main adult contacts was a family with whom we were very close friends. they are a devout family of Creationists and Baptist church goers with two children around the same age as Jason. Jason would learn their beliefs from them. Plus, his school taught him theirs. John and I, being Atheists, generally kept our views to ourselves. Until he asked.\nAt about aged seven I remember him being very emotional and fearing for us. He asked us if we believed in God and Heaven, we both said ‘no’ , he cried “you’ll see I’m right when you die!”. I guess we will!\nToday he is, I believe, an Atheist, but like us he has friends from different and often opposing faiths , all of whom believe blindly that theirs is the only true and righteous path. I enjoy hearing him and his friends ‘philosophise’ (to quote Bill & Ted) on the subject.\nI have friends who ‘ pray for me’. Great. It is of no consequence to me or my sense of well-being, but, if it makes them happier, safer or gives them a feeling of being helpful, then that’s great. If it turns out that I’ve got it wrong on the God front, they have my back covered !\nI don’t mind what people believe as long as they act morally, and considerately and treat others as they would like to be treated themselves, irrespective of their gender, race, sexuality, colour, age and the like. I love all my friends, family and acquaintances for their individuality irrespective of which set of indoctrinations they follow. I don’t care (unless it affects their happiness negatively) what their sexuality is, their social standing, their wealth, their age, their race. So why would I would I worry about which God. I love them for the way they behave, their actions and their interactions.\nTo quote Albert Einstein, “A man’s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.”\nFeeling free to comment here thanks! 😀\nBlind faith huh?\nHere’s is what I would consider to be a more accurate definition of Christian faith…\nBeing persuaded and fully committed in trust, involving a confident belief in the truth, value, and trustworthiness of God. When it comes to Christianity, ‘faith’ is defined by three separate but vitally connected aspects (especially from Luther and Melancthon onwards): notitia (informational content), assensus (intellectual assent), and fiducia (committed trust). So faith is the sum of having the information, being persuaded of its truthfulness, and trusting in it. To illustrate the three aspects: “Christ died for ours sins” (notitia); “I am persuaded that Christ died for our sins” (notitia + assensus); “I deeply commit in trust to Christ who I am persuaded died for our sins” (notitia + assensus + fiducia). Only the latter constitutes faith, on the Christian view.\nConsequently, notitia and fiducia without assensus is blind and therefore not faith. This shipwrecks the egregious canard that faith is merely a blind leap. Faith goes beyond reason—i.e., into the arena of trust—but never against reason. From the Enlightenment onwards, faith has been subject to constant attempts at redefining it into the realm of the irrational or irrelevant (e.g., Kant’s noumenal category); but all such attempts are built on irresponsible straw man caricatures that bear no resemblance to faith as held under the Christian view: notitia, assensus, and fiducia.\n(NOTE: “Christ died for our sins” is an example, not the sum, of notitia or informational content.)\n______\nI don’t consider ancient religion to be outdated or “ridiculous”. The metaphors employed in ancient theology skilfully defy intelligent interpretation. The intelligent modern mind finds itself incapable of understanding such a simplistic literary trick. Woe is us!\nIf my zeitgeist is as it is, atheistic, then wouldn’t my brainwashing most probably entail atheism? How independent is our thinking if it follows most closely what the majority professes? Not something I could justifiably make a fuss about I think 🙂\nI was born into a non religious household. My parents, with no belief systems of their own to pass down, sent me to Sunday school for a short while. When I was rumbled for stashing the collection in my coat lining my religious education ended.\nI think Einstein is wrong in that quote. What he is describing is a religious basis by another name. It already has a name, no need to try to invent another. His overarching meaning seems correct though. Life is for grabbing this moment. Not putting off.\nTake care 😉\nLikeLike\nM8RK !!!\nWe have found some common ground!! There is hope for us both 😉 Life is definitely for grabbing for the moments we have . Do not put off your enjoyment and participation in it for a moment\nThank you again for taking time to read and reply. It must be very frustrating having to deal with me!!!\nkindest Regards\nB\nLikeLike\nThat’s interesting. When I was growing up, talking to another person’s child about religion would have been perceived as extremely hostile in our community. I hate to think what might have happened if someone had tried it. I’m in my late forties and never had children, so I don’t know how it is today, but I suspect it would not turn out well.\nLikeLike\nI’ve never considered it really. My partner was raised in a Methodist environment but at a relatively young age, came to his own conclusions re religion. I was raised with a bit of a Jewish influence but completely rejected the rules which appeared restrictive,nonsensical and controlling, (as well as obviously written by men to marginalise women!).\nI wanted our child to have access to information to make his own choice. Our wonderful friends could answer his questions, share their church culture, as Jason liked to attend the play group at church with their kids. As he grew he then had the ‘information’ he needed to make his own decision based on fact and not bias from our views.\nI can’t understand why anyone who strongly believes in their ‘god’ or whatever should have any issue with different points of view being presented to them or their children. the only reason to have a problem would be for fear of their child realising the reality might be something different.\nLikeLike\nI really have to disagree. Children are very impressionable. Trying to brainwash someone’s child is a very sick thing to do. I guess your kids okay, but that would have upset my parents. We lived in a highly pluralistic community and I think the only reason we all got along is that people understood that there were unstated lines that you just don’t cross. My best friend was Jewish and I attended things like the Purim festival at her temple, but if the Rabbi started trying to convince me to believe in God (I know Jews generally don’t, so this is a highly unlikely hypothetical.) that would have been seen as too aggressive. If I had sought him out and asked questions, I’m sure that would have been fine.\nPerhaps, when you said that he came home saying that you and your husband were going to hell, I assumed that was the result of aggressive proselytizing.\nAlso, our town was about a third Jewish and it’s Christians who usually proselytize, so the situation would probably be Christians trying to convert Jewish kids. That really would have been a nightmare. (I’m neither, btw.)\nLikeLike",

Sometimes its fun, sometimes its political, sometimes its frustration, or angst. Always its real and heartfelt.\nI now live in Mid Wales having found a home with my family (John, my parner and Jason, our son) here in Llanwrtyd Wells where everyday eccentricity is celebrated. a place in the UK that attracts those from outside the mainstream and has created an identity based on its quirkiness. A perfect home for someone like me who tends not to follow the crowd, doesn't have a quiet laugh, and tends to speak first, think later! Life has reached a juncture where I have become aware that when you live your life through rose-tinted spectacles, every experience becomes one including joy, laughter, friends, meetings, experiences and great memories. Having always fancied being a columnist I figured why not share my rose-tinted ramblings with anyone out there who might want to listen- and if no-ones out there, why not write them anyway - bit like a public diary - but hey I have no dirty little secrets that I'm not prepared to share....!!!!\nHair Raising…\nI don’t get the opportunity to go to a ‘real’ hairdressers very often these day.

A bitter sweet mix. Ffloyd was heading away on holiday without me. Worse still she was going without me AND going with Clifford. I guess i was a little jealous. Alongside a large dollop of pride. Clifford is my son Jason’s Singer Chamois. He’s been going along to Imp Club Nationals since he was two.\nThis will be the first one he’s driving to with the added bonus of doing so in a car he built himself. He turned 17 last November and passed his test this April.\nOriginally the plan was for John, Jason and I to go in convoy the 260 miles from Llanwrtyd to Darlington in Thunderbird 4, Clifford and Ffloyd respectively. However, TB4 remains on SORN and our B&B is full . So this amazing adventure is a Crompton only, big boys adventure. John is leading the way in Ffloyd and Jason is following in Clifford. His brother; John’s son, Graham will meet them there in Reg.\nThey’re going to have a ball. Camping, Cars and Cromptons. A winning combination.\nI’m looking forward to the updates – hint hint boys 😉\nOne thought on “Ffloyd and Clifford go Camping”",

Having always fancied being a columnist I figured why not share my rose-tinted ramblings with anyone out there who might want to listen- and if no-ones out there, why not write them anyway - bit like a public diary - but hey I have no dirty little secrets that I'm not prepared to share....!!!!\nLife is a celebration …..\nI think I am almost recovered from the crazy shenanigans of last weekend.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2018_02_28_spring-st-davids-day-and-the-sunshine-flower/content_38.html": "It’s supposed to be Spring, yet (and not for the first time at this time of year) it’s snowing, halting the daffodils in their push to shine bright in our gardens and roadside borders. Its rare, to be fair, for us here in Mid Wales to have many, if any daffodils in flower for St Davids Day , 1st March. Yet every year, as the daffs begin to poke their snouts out of the cold ground in January we hope impatiently and unrealistically , that they will be bobbing their sunny heads in the early days of Spring, before winter has said its final farewells. They never do.\nSo today, the very last of February , there is a blanket of snow covering the grass, hiding the daffodils with their still covered heads, and camouflaging the snowdrops.\nTomorrow is St Davids Day, and living here in Mid Wales for the last 13 years , it’s pretty hard to ignore. Why would I want to anyway?\nSo who is this St David you may be asking…. (or not, but I’m going to tell you anyway).\nDavid was a Welsh bishop of Mynyw ( now St Davids, Pembrokeshire) during the C6th. He lived from 500 – 589 AD and died on the 1st March that year. He was canonised in the 1120AD by Pope Callixtus II and since then 1st March has been a festival day to celebrate him; St Davids Day, Dydd Gŵyl Dewi.\nHe was born to an aristocratic family in SW Wales, descended from the royal house of Ceredigion.. He was a teacher, highly disciplined and during his life helped found a dozen monasteries in all. He founded a Celtic monastic community at Glyn Rhosyn (The Vale of Roses) in Pembrokeshire (where St Davids Cathedral now stands).\nThe Welsh (quite rightly in my opinion) think St Davids Day should be a National Holiday as is St. Andrew’s Day in Scotland and St Patrick’s Day in Ireland. In fact cross-party support resulted in the Welsh National Assembly voting unanimously to make Saint David’s Day a public holiday in 2000. A poll conducted for Saint David’s Day in 2006 found that 87% of people in Wales wanted it to be a bank holiday, with 65% prepared to sacrifice a different bank holiday to achieve this. However a petition in 2007 to make Saint David’s Day a bank holiday was rejected by the office of the then PM Tony Blair (grrrr).\nThe national symbol being the leek, The 7th century king of Gwynedd, Cadwaladr, is said to have ordered his men into battle wearing them for identification purposes.\nBack to the Daffs. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales, the origins of the national flower of Wales appears to be as an attractive interloper, introduced during the 19th century, as a replacement for the humble leek. David Lloyd George, the only Welshman to serve as PM, was a public advocate of the daffodil and its appearance in early spring as a symbol of nature’s optimism neatly coincides with St David’s Day on March 1.\nSo there you have it, whilst we have no daffodils in flower here at Cerdyn Villa yet, there are plenty , I’m sure, in full bloom in England. there are certainly loads in the shops but I shall wait until my garden is abundant with them.\nIn the meantime I’ll make to with the stained glass ones I’ve been working on.\nReblogged this on Boxofmisc and commented:\nMy friend Berni, you might want to pop over to her site and enjoy her ramblings too.\nLikeLike\nMy hubby is Welsh and my kids are very proud of their (half) Welsh heritage! I love Daffodils so we always try to have some in the house for St David’s Day but I never knew any history of the day so thanks for sharing.\nP.S. Your stained glass daffs are gorgeous – so delicate! #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nhiya. So glad you enjoyed the blog and like my glass. We moved her 13 years ago from England and feel very at home in Wales. Our son grew up here. He had the best childhood. When he was about 7 he said he wanted to be Welsh and could he chnge – told him he could be whatever he wanted 😉\nLikeLike\nIt is Autumn here, summertime is over although it is still 30 degrees and swimming weather. It sounds lovely the snow, the beginning of Springtime and the Daffodils. The stain glass is so pretty too. Thank you for linking up with #ablogginggoodtime\nLikeLike\nwe never get 30 degrees! 21 is a good summer and it suits me just fine – means I still have the energy to potter in the garden . Delighted you like my glass. Will be making more flowers over the next few weeks – seems to be quite a demand for them\nLikeLike\nI’ve always felt a bit sad that St David’s Day isn’t a bigger deal than it is.I do love to dress my children in their Welsh outfits and feel very proud of our roots.The stained glass daffodils are gorgeous! #LGRTStumble\nLikeLike\nI agree. Especially after my son left infant/junior school, it kind of gets lost. It was nice to spend some time writing about it. It has strengthened my determination to visit Castell Coch this year too… its not that far away and its one of the few castles I’ve not visited. Glad you like the daffs – am adding them to my Etsy store today\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nwow i did not know all of that about st davids day! great post x #LGRTSumble\nLikeLike\nthank you x\nLikeLike\nI used to live in Malvern, close to the borders and my teacher was Welsh so we used to celebrate and I miss it. Love your stained glass daffs! #bloggerclubuk\nLikeLike\nthank you. xx Am making a batch (bunch) for my Etsy shop and the WI\nLikeLike",

Maybe it’s because its Christmas Eve and Santa will already be flying around dropping off pressies in the relevant time zones. More likely it’s because I received a demo copy of a 6 track EP of original songs by a young band called the Hurricanes of which Jason is part. I’ve listened to it a zillion times and my tummy flutters , I get goosebumps and have even shed a tear. Best Christmas present EVER. Sadly at this time I can’t share it as they’re sorting out copyright protection and sending it to recording studios. If I get any prouder I might burst.

It’s a statistical calculation used by the ‘failed’ side in most elections. It’s the fascinating thing about statistics. They really can say anything. By ‘fascinating’ read ‘frustrating’, ‘annoying’ or downright ‘misleading’.\nYou could use the same statistical method the other way round. That is , apportion all those who abstained (didn’t know, didn’t care, or didn’t make it to the polls) on the Brexit side.\nDoing so we could conclude that 67% of the population didn’t vote Remain!!!!\nIn the hope at this point Remainers continue reading, I would say “stick with me, I’m writing here about statistics, not Brexit”. I’m using Brexit as an example of statistics in use.\nPersonally, I used a similar statistical argument after the May elections when I was aggrieved that the Tories were voted in. It’s not quite the same because we run a FPTP voting system so the Tories did actually only have 36% of the vote. I still used the argument and added the non-voters to the other side reducing the Tory leadership to representing only 16% of the electorate. Shocking huh?\nClever old stats. Marketeers, politicians; economists and businesses around the world rely on statistics to prove their point and to make life altering decisions. but statistics can say whatever you want. simple use and compare the numbers with different things to get your point across. I worked in Sales for a while I always managed to make the results sound positive , I just compared them with a different period or product or person….\nWe’re all human and we all have an opinion, so remember, assume everything you read is biased, even if it’s trying not to be. Even this!!!! 😉",

I never, ever notice it coming and never ever recognise the pattern and when it arrives I feel stupid. The stupidity comes from not seeing the obvious, of confidently denying and misinterpreting the early signs.\nI’ve been ‘off sorts’ for some months. I put it down initially to being overweight and, as such, breathless. Then I became plagued with an over itchy scalp, and increased wheeziness. Alongside this I did actually discover I had an ear infection and needed something to cure some cold-like symptoms . I think I was coughing for about 6 weeks before I went to the doctors – remember the ‘Is it Urgent’ blog?\nWhen I finally went to see the doc I had gathered a fair portfolio of minor ailments and symptoms and felt like a bit of a hypochondriac. John went with me and I came away with the bumper party pack of drugs/creams/lotions/sprays etc.\nIt was John who made me aware of how heavily I breathe and since, I have become completely obsessed and self-conscious about it. IT IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT – I’ve had all the blood tests, oxygen tests and chest x-rays. It seems that over time – probably since a couple of years ago when I had that bout of panic attacks, I’ve forgotten how to breathe properly. You’d think breathing would be more straightforward than riding the proverbial bike. Apparently not. Anyway I am off to see a respiratory specialist very soon.\nAlongside this set of minor ailments, I (thought) on the whole I was happy (which I am) and stress free (which I am). However having no stress does not mean that one does not necessarily cease to be anxious. And because its crept up on me I hadn’t picked up on the signs. Hence the feeling stupid. I’ve been through this cycle before, many times. I can only liken it to like having a slow puncture, I’ve gradually deflated and didn’t notice the soft sponginess until I skidded off the path on a slight bendas I could no longer grip the track.\nI can’t quite identify the bend that caused me to waiver off the road. I think its been coming ever since last Christmas when I closed In the Pink. The lack of self discipline to create a routine of home working. The sense of loss, that I was barely aware of. I can react just fine to the demands of B&B and thrive on the busy periods. Given any task by anyone else I can meet or exceed the expectations. My work ethic is not marred. Getting into an ‘office mode’ regarding glass work, painting and the marketing thereof, however, has left me flailing and a pathetic and positively lazy, lack lustre and possibly (without even noticing), ever so slightly depressed, ever so slightly panicky and ever so slightly lost.\nAlso somewhat isolated although I was under the impression (genuinely) that I was enjoying being out of the loop, away from the thick of it and the local politics. Hiding away out of the fray here at C.V. I wonder now if I have also become a little agoraphobic? Certainly there are days when nothing will persuade me to leave the house and sometimes I just feel SO TIRED.\nAnyway, until about three days ago I was oblivious to all of these signs. Then on Tuesday whilst out merrily doing the weekly shop, my heart started palpitating, my breath became more sharp and urgent, my chest tightened. I sat in the car for a while concentrating on relaxing and breathing wondering if I was having a heart problem or a panic attack, wondering if I was being a hypochondriac. When it subsided I did the shopping and came home. Wednesday I was fine again. Thursday I slept most of the day. Friday, I spent the day convinced it was Thursday!!! Self employment – all the days are the same.\nDespite thinking it was Thursday I had a lovely, productive day, painting a commission promised as a Christmas gift, and its going well. John reminds me we were out for the evening. It would be a great evening, no pretenses, great friends, easy conversation, good food, free flowing home brew. I’d been looking forward to it for weeks. The first party of the holiday season with all my favourite people.\nBut then it hit, I could not possibly leave the house, I needed an excuse so I wouldn’t appear pathetic. I was feeling very anxious. I should go, it would be great if I could just get there. I couldn’t get there. I sent an email telling the truth, too embarrassed to phone. My lovely friend sent a lovely persuasive reply.”We should go” I said to john , “look how lovely and sympathetic and understanding our friends are”. But I could not go. Palpitations, anxiety, guilt, embarrassment.\nFunny thing is life is pretty good. I’m not particularly , or excessively, worried about anything. Our son is coping despite school! He is excelling in his exams, enjoying his music, has a great group of friends. There have been a few moments of teenage angst moments but not many. The B&B has been healthy, all guests happy, regular business,repeat and new customers,excellent reviews. I so enjoy having B&B guests in the house..\nI’ve also been enjoying exhibiting and selling at a few Christmas Craft Fairs. I should have made more and done more, I’ve had loads of time but much less energy and drive. The few commission pieces I’ve done have been really successful.\nI think I feel like this every December, like time is racing ahead of me, that I am spinning a little out of control and Christmas Day will arrive and I won’t have remembered to shop for it or wrap things. I would have run out of days to get a tree up. Or not yet have decided whether to buy turkey, lamb or ham for Christmas lunch. Or run out of postal days to send mum and dad their gifts, or John’s Aunties their cards. Or that Dad’s birthday is on Christmas Eve. Its madness, because I love choosing gifts, being amongst friends, decorating the tree, preparing a special meal. So the annual anxiety about it creeping up on me makes no sense at all.\nSo what is it? Is it a mild case of Anxiety Disorder? I think so. And here is my action plan:-\n1.Get a job to give my days purpose and structure\n2 Make sure that job is local, interesting and not in middle management\n3.learn to breathe from my diaphragm\n4. get out in the fresh air\n5.go to yoga or tai chi\n6.practice regular mindfulness exercises\n7.try not to feel a fool for missing the signs (again!)\nI’ve written this for several reasons but definitely not to illicit sympathy (because that will be really embarrassing). I also don’t want any of my family or friends to be concerned. Its who I am and generally I manage it well these days.\nI’ve written it firstly to try and clarify in my own head the journey of my slow puncture. Secondly, I’ve written it because I suspect a lot of people have moments like mine to lesser and greater extents and that I’m not totally weird and alone in feeling this way! Thirdly, in the hope that those who do feel this way on occasion to those lesser or greater degrees will find comfort in the knowledge that they too are not weird (or alone)!\nI hope this helps someone feel a little more normal on an occasion where they might be slipping out of control.\nI also hope that my wonderful and gorgeous friends whose company I missed out on the pleasure of this evening will not feel either affronted, nor concerned. Its one of those things, part of who I am, and sometimes I just need to accept “me” and stop over analysing myself.\nLove, peace, inner happiness and joy to you all from your ever-so- slightly-unique; ever-so-slightly-out-of-control; pink haired; chaotic; hippy-chick friend x",

All our best decisions are made of the cuff and following the heart. Never has a good decision been made from weighing up the pros and cons and doing a cost analysis – i can use both buying a flat off plan in Southend and investing pension money in Equitable Life as two very costly examples of trying to be grown up and sensible.\nJohn and I prefer to go with what feels right, with an ‘it’ll be right’ attitude to how it will all work out. (At this point I have to admit that John has always been much better at this than I when it comes to playing the “What If ” game – but I am pretty much getting the hang of it).\nWe know it and love it as the “HOME OF BOGSNORKELLING”. It is a USP that opitimises our life & this lovely little town – quirky, interesting, fun, and friendly – always up for a laugh, showing visitors a good time. Not many towns (or villages) are lucky enough to have a real USP. Businesses spend thousands on think tanks to identify these. We have this one handed to us on a plate – or rather, through the enthusiasm, determination and imagination of Mr Gordon Green – creator of our many quirky events. Together with a go-getting community of tireless volunteers who make these things happen year on year.\nMoving from the outskirts of London our friends there might wonder that we would not ‘miss the excitement’, ‘ have nothing to do’, ‘ be bored’ . To be honest we didn’t think about any such issues before we came nor did we think about how active we would end up being either. In all my years B.L. (Before llanwrtyd) I never met, spoke to , or had anything to do with journalists, TV crews or people in the public eye. But here its almost a weekly occurrence. Yesterday I was chatting to CNN about the rules of Bogsnorkelling and liaising with National Geographic channel who are sending a film crew. We’ve had Paddy McGuiness, Griff-Rhys Jones, CNN, CBS, So TV, the list goes on.\nSome years back Chris and Ingrid Tarrant, before their acrimonious split , were here filming a series about a road trip around Wales. You may have seen the first series where they traveled around England. Anyway, there was Ingrid ready to jump in the Bog and give it a go…. but she didn’t have a towel….\nInteresting things happen when you open your eyes and you least expect them. Live it, love it.\n“We are all here for a spell, get all the good laughs you can.”\nWill Rogers",

I’m a little fearful, however that as you read it you will simply decide I have a mental health issue. After decades of experience, I genuinely believe (except during those periods of time when I’m engulfed by it) that it is hormone related and a collective group of PMT symptoms. The medical profession, in my experience, continue to ignore them and prefer to diagnose and treat the symptoms rather than the cause.\nSome months pass by with almost no changes, some, where I may have a day or two of low tolerance (sorry John!!!); most provide at least one day of thickheadedness, lethargy and the like. About every third month it results in a migraine and vomiting. A cycle within the cycle. Then every so often possibly every 4th month this happens:\nA complete paralysis of common sense/ desire/ self belief/ grasp of, takes hold coupled with what can only be described as ‘flu’ symptoms – thick head, poor temperature control, aching, tiredness and topped off with a fuzzy mental state. By fuzzy mental state I mean vivid dreams which mix obvious dream situations with ‘alternative’ realities rendering the ‘real’ reality and ‘alternatives’ whisked together in the mind so whilst awake I confuse what is real and what was dream and feel the emotions associate with the ‘alternative’ towards those involved and become unsure of which reality is the real state of events. Mad? Probably!\nIts exhausting trying to unpick the real world from the dream one. I’m left disorientated at worst, unsettled and confused at best. I need to sleep (a lot), I feel ‘unwell’ and I struggle to function effectively. It can last one day , it can occasionally last as long as four (which is horrific). O M G.\nSo today is day 3 and I’m trying to grasp onto ‘me’ . To do this I’m sharing with all of you. Sorry if it bothers you, but we have an unspoken agreement that lets me share these things. Thanks! The act of sharing helps. You are welcome to share your traumas in return. xxx\nWell, I wanted to hit the “like” button, but honestly that seemed harsh.\nI’m sorry you experience these brutal cycles of hormones. I’m no medical person, but this does seem like something which needs addressing.\nIf it makes you feel any better, I “suffer” from Dissociative Identity Disorder. (I wouldn’t place a personality disorder under the tag suffer, and honestly I have fun with it!) but people can be quite uneasy around me. Which is why I tend to enjoy online confrontations more that IRL ones.\nSharing helps!\nLikeLike",

What a waste of time. It only shows us the bit of ‘stuff’ that has been managed, declared and taxed like every Joe Blogs does. Personally if someone takes a job that pays £100K then so be it, as long as they pay the UK tax rates on it. If they earn an extra £40K in bonuses and ‘benefits’ then fair play, as long as they declare it and get taxed according to the HMRC laws of our land. All that showing us their tax returns does is let us know what they are prepared to declare.\nSurely are issues are not with the bits they do legally and morally, it’s the other bits, they ‘spin’ , use legal loopholes for and ‘accidently’ forget about.\nLike, the inflated salary they might pay their husband/wife/son/daughter as fashion advosor/secretary/moat cleaner. Like the second home in the city they have because 20 miles is too far to commute to work and they’re entitled to a second home if Westminster is too far away for them. Or like the mortage interest they claim back on a mortgage that ceased to be 10 years prior but they ‘accidently’ forgot to stop claiming.\nThese are the things that are either illegal or immoral or are using the built in loopholes that they keep for themselves that the public is concerned about. These loopholes will never be closed because it is only the rich and influential that benefit from them (ie them and their funders, family and friends) so they do not want them closed.\nOK, some people might be jealous about how much they earn or feel they earn too much for the job they do. I personally thing bin men are unfairly paid. Its a dirty job (literally), most people wouldn’t/couldn’t do it, they should earn more. Inspirational teachers. They should earn more. Politicians they should earn less. BUT. the rate for the job is the rate for the job and people take the jobs because they have the skills or need to take them and they do the job. Some do their job well, others less so. It’s then the responsibility of the personnel departments and line managers to ‘manage’ those issues. We might not like what people earn but they are allowed to earn it.\nThe other stuff. That’s a different story. That’s illegal (sometimes), immoral and hypocritical (often), that’s cheating, taking advantage of their position and downright inappropriate for sustaining credibility in a role of representing the populous.\nIt makes the system a nonesense. Its INSANE… and that’s another reason I stand of Loony\nIf you don’t usually vote, vote unusually.\nThe Official Monster Raving Loony Party . Vote for Insanity, You Know it Makes Sense.\nDisclaimer: This blog post represents the views of her Ladyship, Lady Lily the Pink and her more serious alter ego, Bernice Benton , and may or may not have any bearing or relation to the opinions of the Monster Raving Loony Party or the individuals I like to think I am representing. I speak for me , as me , and through me…. maybe some of my thoughts and opinions work for you too…\neverything points more and more to corruption and a ‘them and us’ view regarding behaviour and laws for the people at the top of all the decicion making…if I did a job and put the £20 in my back pocket and didn’t declare it and pay the £4 tax I’d be a tax evader… if I could afford to put it in an offshore fund I’d be financially savvy… thats the lunacy of these loopholes they keep open for their own benefit grrrrrr\nLikeLike\nSpot on as always Berni!\nI am appalled by the total lack of understanding this government has for how we, the population, the voters, feel about this. Cameron’s entire childhood, and a very expensive education, were paid for by money from funds that were avoiding tax. His childhood was paid for at the expense of the working classes. The only hope I have is that the popular classes will actually care enough to rise up and take some action now. Enough. More than enough.\nDinah x\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_01_04_life-is-a-story-book/content_1996.html": "Life eh? Yours , mine, theirs. Our respective lives are made up of chapters, each one effecting directly or indirectly the future chapters yet to be written. We can feel like life is a collection of short stories but as each story influences our personalities (moods, knowledge, behaviour, experiences) we take ‘information’ from all our stories and use that knowledge in the stories or chapters that follow.\nIn theory we all have a book in us. Whether we believe our book to be interesting enough to write or our voices articulate enough to tell it is another thing. Also, I find that the ‘chapters’ get muddled and its often hard to reminisce or tell each in isolation.\nAnyway, as its New Year I thought I might share one of my very happy chapters with you. It is not a chapter in isolation. It’s the one about how I met John but it culminates with a 10 years on, rapidly approaching 20. It’s a happy, intimate story and I share it with you all because its joyous and lovely and ‘real’ and quite romantic 😉 and we all deserve a bit of light and romance to remind us of the good and the joy and the hope especially when our lives are writing chapters that are more challenging.\nSo here we go. I hope you enjoy my story:-\n1994, I can’t remember what month. I’d been traveling around it Israel mainly and had come back to the UK to earn some money to go off again (probably to South Africa. I was 26. A friend, Anne, whom I’d made in Israel and who remains a very good friend, returned to the UK before me and told me to get in touch. A friend of hers had a recruitment agency and she’d be able to get me temp work with her in The City. Barings in fact. and yes – I was there when the Nick Leeson saga hit the fan but that really is a different chapter.\nI was contracted to do some accounting/adminny type work, I forget the details . John was in another department in the same building by Liverpool St Station on the same floor doing something relating to merchant banking. I was chatty, confident, outgoing, I’d just spent 2 years traveling. I embraced the tail end of the city boom and the freedom of being single and working in the city: lunch time drinking, after work parties etc.\nI think I’d seen John a couple of times around the office. He had kind, smiling eyes and on his desk was a photo of his sons. I think I’d commented on how lovely they looked. Then in mid October we were in a lift together heading to a leaving do for a chap called Nick Lebrun. I joked with him asking if his wife had given him permission to stay out late and come to the party. At which point another work friend and great character (Boris Johnson reminds me of him) , Nick Perry-Evans kicked my shin. Apparently John was separated.\nI remember very little of the party except getting pretty drunk, flirting with John and making the following outrageous suggestion:\n“I’m off to Africa in 3 months if you fancy a no strings affair until then take me to lunch on tomorrow”.\nAnd that’s how it began. A mid-week party and a massive mid-week hangover. I was sat at my desk opposite my friend Amanda who would spot John before me as he approached on a ‘purposeful’ loop around the quadrangle, paperwork in hand. He’d slow on approach and then continue straight past!! This happened several times. Poor man.\nEventually he plucked up the courage to ask me to lunch. Hoorah! I felt so sick that day. Not enough sleep, far too much drink. I’d try to ‘dress to impress’ and ended up in a Khaki skirt and jacket that were too short and too tight! The last thing I waned to do was eat or drink!.\nWe went to the Bowling Green restaurant in Finsbury Square. Talk about pleasure-pain. We chose the worst thing to eat on a hangover, pork in a cream and cider sauce with a bottle of red wine!!! I spent the entire meal willing myself to swallow and not vomit!\nThere it was. From then on we went to lunch everyday, with our favourite place being upstairs in the Dirty Dicks before it became like all the other trendy wine bar type restaurants. We had the same waitress each time, Ella from Poland and my favourite was mash with smoked haddock and poached egg. We’d take 2 hour lunches and come back slightly tiddly having shared a bottle of wine (people in the city did that then). The following weekend I went to stay with him at his flat in Westcliff and we went out dancing. That was 21st October.\nWe didn’t tell anyone at work we were dating although I’m sure everyone knew.\nOn 14th Feb two dozen red roses appeared on my desk. The secret was out! I was already living with him I think!! I pretty much moved in straight away. We had no expectations as I had promised no strings – so we didn’t pretend to be things we weren’t, didn’t delay calling or going out for fear of appearing ‘too keen’ . I think because of this we really got to know each other, we had a whirlwind of fun in that 3 months.\nThe time came for me to leave. John hadn’t asked me to stay as that wasn’t the deal. Nervously one evening I asked him how he would feel if I stayed and I told him I loved him.\nOK – you can puke now – I know its corny. It’s also real.\nThat was eighteen and a half years ago. On our tenth anniversary John surprised me with a CD. An original song written in conjunction with his friend Ian Harvey and recorded in Ian’s studio in Diss (Pan Music), with John singing. “Something Special’ by The John Crompton Band!!! Our story so far. Get your flight bag at the ready in case you vomit (again!) and take a listen if you feel you can handle the slush!\nMaybe for our 20th I’ll get the updated version? Hint hint 😉\nLove can be real. It can survive good times and bad, ill-health, financial struggle, births, deaths, extended family and mental health! However I truly believe ours has only survived because it happened after our other chapters, the ones with breakups, heartache and grief. Without those past chapters we may well have given up on our relationship in the subsequent and inevitable ‘difficult chapters’ but, and for this I am so grateful, John especially, hung in there, realising the special relationship we have. Between us we have lived those chapters of angst, pain and sorrow. They have been very few but when they’ve arrived they’ve been very intense and all-consuming.\nAs a couple these days we are strong, happy, understanding of each other, respect each others strengths and weaknesses. Enjoy life. We do that ‘dance’ that couples who have been together a while do. We know automatically which roles each of us has responsibility for, we communicate often without speaking. And more importantly, we still laugh, love and share together. we sit together on the sofa and hold hands every evening whilst drinking tea and watching TV. We hold hands when we walk together, we kiss each other goodnight and we open our souls to each other. Life would not be life without him and any chapters without him would not be worth writing.\nI give you a true love story, one of the most happy chapters of my ‘real’ life, to take you into 2014.\nI was going to stop there and then last night it occurred to me to refer back to the beginning of this blog – where does each chapter start and finish? I believe that most of us have had ‘true love’ chapters or ‘dizzy romance’ chapters we just have to remember to end the ‘chapter’ before it flows into a ‘breakup’ one. If I look back I’ve had a good 3 ‘dizzy romances’ in my life but they were followed with respectively ‘heartbreak’ , ‘ anger and disappointment ‘ , ‘feeling like a twit’ chapters. I think we would all be happier if we retold these chapters in our life stopping before the end of the relationship but instead at the end of the love/lust/romance phase. Take a marriage that has ended in divorce, surely the first chapter was heady romance/love/lust maybe followed by a couple of chapters of contentment, one of marriage and first home, one of first child, some happy holiday chapters before the final sad one. And then if we continue to extrapolate the final one may not actually be ‘the final one’ until the end of our lives these past chapters will continue to affect our future ones as we learn from the good and bad of the past and take these lessons into our futures. I can honestly say that I look back on my past ‘true love chapters’ as un-rounded as they may have been in hindsight, and remember fondly and gratefully the words that make them and the images that accompany them. They are part of who I am today, of the person who values the love and luck I now have.\nEveryone’s life is a book – be it a private diary to remain un-shared , or a celebration of life to be screamed from the rooftops, a witty repertoire or a lament of unfulfilled longing. But remember our book is only part written who knows what adventures and paths we might travel before the end.\nSince writing this blog I have had the pleasure of discovering this TED TALK by Philosopher, Stephen Cave. Very profound, interesting and pretty much sums it up for me – hope you enjoy it too\nI love this! What a beautiful way to capture your story together so far. It’s so heart-warming to read that you’ve found your happy ever after. Here’s to the chapters and adventures which lie ahead. Thanks for linking to #DreamTeam x x\nLikeLike\nLife is indeed a book with so many chapters. The best part is, we don’t know what the end will be like. Thanks for sharing.#dreamteam\nLikeLike\n#thesatsesh Im not sure which bit i loved the most, probably the Polish waitress or the cute CD? hmm…I wrote mine a while back, I’ll link it up to next weeks #thesatsesh if I remember – it has a similar beginning in honesty and upfront communication. True love is effortless mainly isn’t it, even through the hard times x\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nSo looking forward to your story xc\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nOh yes, I like the analogy of life being like a book and so many chapters. Also never straightforward with it is twists and turns.But sitll theraputic to recall the memories X #thesatsesh\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nSo my paths to turn down..\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nLovely story 🙂 Also, a very interesting post, this is exactly where my head has been recently. As I get older I feel more of an urge to look back and tell my story. I’d write a book but the more I think about it the less I can organise it all neatly into chapters. You are so right about past relationships though, I only had one, which ended badly, but I focus on the good stuff that came out of it (2 children and lots of happy days) and focus less on the bad facts. that’s why we remain friends, and he’s friends with my new husband. I will have to take a look at that Ted talk now 🙂\n#blogcrush\nLikeLike\nyou spelled my name wrong\nLikeLike\nYou also have to bear in mind that real life is messy and the stories you read and watch have been crafted to have neat beginnings, middles and ends. It’s a bit odd when you go back to real life and find that it’s all overlapping and your not sure when each chapter stops or starts.\nLikeLike\nexactly Graham! Thanks for reading it .\nLikeLike",

The point raised was one I have been struggling with too and as he has brought it to the forefront of my mind I thought I would address it promptly and honestly, as best as I can. Be damned with the prospective backlash!\nA few of years ago I stood for the County Council under the Libdem banner, I did so to ensure that the county council seat was not handed to its previous incumbent without being contested. I didn’t expect to win, but I wanted the existing incumbent to have to meet his voters and justify his re-election. I felt very strongly that, should the existing incumbent remain , that he remained because he was voted into the seat. The importance of this being two-fold. The community should have the opportunity to vote him out should they wish to and He should be able to defend His actions in the knowledge that He was/is the voted in representative.\nI chose to stand as Libdem rather than Loony for several reasons, the primary one being the huge respect I have for the local Libdem team. At the time that would have been Roger Williams as our local MP and Kirsty Williams who I am relieved to say, is our AM. I also did so as I knew I would have the support of local politicians who represent our small rural community with the energy and respect it deserves.\nWhy then, would I choose to stand in the Welsh Assembly Elections 2016 for the Monster Raving Loony Party and against the Libdems (or more accurately against Kirsty). It’s a good question. It doesn’t seem fair.\nHowever , here are my reasons\nI was beyond words when Roger Williams was voted out and replaced by the Conservative MP, Chris Davies. Roger (and Kirsty) are seemingly the only politicians who regularly and publicly show support on a daily basis for the concerns of the constituents of Brecknockshire and in particular, Llanwrtyd Wells. As I suspected would happen, I feel that Chris Davies has not been seen since (although I am sure some may feel differently). I suspect we will not have the opportunity to get up close and personal to our Conservative representative again until he is campaigning for his seat.\nI have been a Loony Party member for some years, reconciling my involvement with the fact the Llanwrtyd was the spiritual home of its founder and leader, Screaming Lord Sutch, and feeling that my interests in tourism, and the eccentricities of LW that generate much of its tourism trade sit very nicely alongside a large and loud Loony population.\nI am also completely and absolutely dissolutioned and despairing of the political system of the UK and feel very strongly that its structure, position and voice fails to truly represent the majority of its population. I particularly feel that in Wales; in rural Wales; in Llanwrtyd Wells; we are of no significance to Westminster or the Welsh Assembly. Mostly I feel the political system is insane and in an insane system voting left, right or liberal will have no baring or benefit to us as individuals.\nThe system doesn’t make sense. And when it doesn’t make sense and it doesn’t represent us the only thing to do is protest and the best way I can protest is with ridicule. And that is why I am standing as a Loony.\nToday I was called an anarchist for trying to fight for the bank… not because of the fight but because I was fighting to cause Barclays as much inconvenience as I can prior to what many believe is an inevitable conclusion. Maybe I am an anarchist. I prefer to think of myself as a socialist, an activist, a compassionist. I do it to give (in my own small way) a voice to the little people. I’m brash, I’m loud. I’m tenacious. Many of you may say I’m annoying . But there are people in our communities who do not get heard. There are people who are not ‘up to speed’ with modern technology. There are those who do not want to and shouldn’t have to be ‘up to speed’ with it. There are elderly people living isolated lives; young people who can’t afford a car or maybe don’t have access to a computer; people who don’t feel they can speak out; people whose voice is too quiet to be heard. There are people who do not have the energy to challenge the system or feel there is little point in doing so. I feel that I am fighting for their rights , if they want my fight to be about them. I’m not doing it for notoriety. I do it because I care less than them about how I will be perceived. I do it because I think it’s the right thing to do. And I do it because I can.\nI guess I am very political. I can’t bear injustice of the individual or those within our small community. I don’t think that a political party, a corporation, a financial institution should put profit above all else. I believe that these groups, who benefit from the individuals in a population, should have some sort of moral obligations that may not necessarily help maximise their profits but might make the lives of small communities and specific groups a little better. I don’t think that any of our political parties have the individual at the heart of their policies.\nI believe there are individual politicians that may… Kirsty Williams and Roger Williams being two such individuals.\nAnd if I thought that standing in this failing system for the Libdems would make a difference I would possibly do it. But I don’t. I think that the system deserves ridicule and for that reason I shall be standing as Lady Lily of the Monster Raving Loony Party in the Welsh Assembly elections in May 2016\nKirsty knows I am a Loony Liberal. I apologise if my standing might affect her vote count. I do, however, very much doubt it. I also apologise if by association I might be an embarrassment! If you are in Brecknockshire I would say (as I dare to do so), for local issues, vote for Kirsty, but if you don’t plan to vote for Kirsty, then maybe consider voting for me…..\nOne thought on “Insanity….. in an insane system its the only thing that makes sense”",

Will everyone continue along their merry path? Will the world even skip a beat?\nI guess for a moment there will be a ‘gathering’; a wake. Maybe a reminiscence; a few kind words; the odd shedding of a tear. Then life will continue its persistent drive onward. Those left behind will go back to work, play, love, laugh. Children will be born. People will pass..\nBut if the world doesn’t stop when I go , then what was my point.\nBut if the world stops when I pass, then what is the point?\nLife is lived; new life is born and the world continues to turn.\nIn a moment of ego-centricity; self-absorption I imagine or hope that the world would stop in my passing; grief too strong for life to continue.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_12_08_the-beautiful-city-of-oxford/content_1284.html": "It’s been a wonderful but hard year. Hubby and I have been busy busy busy, and last month, whilst in the throes of celebrating my big birthday (I know its hard to believe , looking at me that I’m 50), I had a bit of a mishap with a vat of bolognaise sauce and have since spent 4 weeks back and forth to minor injuries unit at our local hospital in Llandrindod Wells for the burns to be dressed. They’re nearly better… What a wonderful team of nurses they have…\nAdd to that the ‘end of season’ cold/flu bug, and Hubby and I were just about ready to drop. We needed a break.\nI booked two days in Oxford. It’s one of those places we pass all the time, to and from our family in London and Essex and back home to Mid Wales, but we have never stopped there, always skirting around the bypass.\nI found Abodes B&B on booking.com and, OMG, if there was ever a lovelier, more comfortable and more homely, warm welcome (other than at our own B&B #blowourowntrumpet 😉 ), I can’t image (although there is also one in Harlech… I’ll write about that another day). When I booked I was full of the worst cold, still boob bandaged and , still had guests in the B&B. I did try to contact the B&B to postpone but , like us, its family run and out of season, she’d gone away for the weekend and , like here, she was in a pocket of the UK that still has limited internet/phone access (hard to believe in 2017/2018 that we still have these problems). Anyway. having messaged the B&B asking to change the dates and being unable to contact them I was a little worried that they would not be expecting us so when we arrived and met Lliwen Williams we were so delighted. The B&B is basically her home, with a couple of rooms open to guests and all the comforts and trappings of visiting your fave family member or friends for a couple of nights. The double en-suite we had was warm and cosy, well equipped (beyond expectation) and, whilst it said ‘continental breakfast only’ the array and quality of food and flexibility over breakfast timings was exceptional. Just what I needed with feeling so rough.\nIt was also great to tap into Lliwen’s local knowledge. We found a great pub for in an idyllic location for our first night evening meal, thanks to her; and we used the local bus instead of park and ride saving us both time and money getting into and out of Oxford\nLliwen and her daughter, Seren (Welsh for ‘star’) were so lovely, we left feeling like we had new friends. I cannot rate Abodes B&B highly enough. The corporate looking website doesn’t begin to represent the unique, warm welcome you will receive.\nOxford itself is magical, historical, romantic, stunning. There is a brand new indoor shopping complex called Westgate, filled with all the big High Street names if that’s what floats your boat. We didn’t go there. We wanted to discover the real Oxford. We walked through the whole of the old city; round the ancient castle, and old prison complex; along the river and canal; through the college grounds and park; taking in the gorgeous sandstone historic architecture; enjoying the riverside tranquility and wildlife; relaxing in some of the quaint historic free-houses and buying gifts from gorgeous boutique shops selling handmade crafts and gifts.\nI’d recommend this little shop which lived up to the sign outside with buckets full of quirky, unique gifts, many of which were sourced from UK-based artisans, and with the most lovely shop manager, Salleanne, who told us the stories behind some of the makers. We came out with a bag of booty, which I can’t show you because some of it might be for you…\nI can also recommend The Chequers, a Nicholson pub squeezed into a back alley of old Oxford and brimming with character, great ales and comfy sofas. Again, the corporate website does not represent its unique warmth and friendliness. We sat in there for ages. Hubby tried a few real ales, they do third pints so you can have tasters , but once he’d found Saltaires Triple Chocoholic Ale, he was smitten. the young barman, Dave, guided me through the gin menu, I settled on Nicholsons, which apparently is distilled by the great-grandson of the original Nicholsons who founded the original brewery chain/freehold pubs back in 1837 (who says drinking isn’t educational). He also helped me work out how to use my new phone (I couldn’t work out where and how to send and receive texts!!! #nocomment )\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! What a great way to spend your birthday too – there is nothing I like more than exploring when it comes to things to do!!!! Adventure makes us feel 20 years younger 🙂\nLikeLike\nSounds like a wonderful break and what a beautiful city. I’ve only ever passed through but might have to visit properly at some point. Hope you’re feeling better now after the bolognaise incident and the cold! #BlogCrush\nLikeLike\nLooks beautiful! Love oxford #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nI do now too\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_02_23_focus-aspire-inspire/content_957.html": "I have been inspired, as I often am, by certain bloggers I follow. This time my muse is Debbie of My Random Musings.\nAs I flutter around in random formation, flitting from this project to that; this passion to that; this idea to that; this demand on my time to that; I get through my days,week and months in a blink of an eye. Completing a lot of stuff; dipping my toes in many a pond and having a great deal of fun but it all kinds of floats around in a mishmash of activity without borders, direction or guidelines.\nThat’s all very well. A nice, jolly, unfocused existence, guided by optimism and chance, but I really would like to look back on a year without being completely surprised by how I got from January to Christmas and the circuitous route I took to get there.\nI’m not saying I don’t love the surprised. I do. That’s the problem. I enjoy the freedom of it a little too much. Sometimes to the point that at any point in the year I’m not really sure what sort of ground I might find under each footstep. More importantly I’m not moving forward. I’m treading the beautiful waters in which I wallow and am allowing myself to enjoy things as they float by; maybe latching onto them for stability for a few moments; but never really reeling myself in.\nI’d like to be able to say my starting point was A by goals were B,C and D with a few distractions via M,Q and W, but I made it to D by the end of an allotted time. I’d like to measure my achievements as well as list them.\nSo *deep breath* I’m taking Debbie’s advice and starting with a bucket list:\n1.TWITTER – I’d love to have over 500 followers before the end of the year, a small hop rather than a leap – in my mind I already know I really want 1000 but let’s be realistic about these things. This is me\n2. ALSO TWITTER – I need to find help and learn how to use it more effectively – I love talking politics, parenting, art, religion, tourism – I don’t want to focus on one topic – I love to RAMBLE and REACT and REFLECT as he mood takes me and the words grab me but I must more effectively access the right people for each topic otherwise I am aware I may bore, or worse, annoy my followers\n3.BLOGGING – again I want to ramble randomly so I’m aware I need to be smarter with my tags/metatags/linky’s/sharing . Again I need advice . I can find lots of blog share site but I’m not interested in fashion, cosmetics, hair and makeup and I’m in the UK… I need to find other companions – as fun as some of those I follow are – I need more of the random eccentrics out there. I won’t put a link as you’re already here but feel free to have a look round if you can make it to the end of this post 😉\n4.ALSO BLOGGING – I need to set a goal for ‘followers’ but I don’t really want followers so much as interactors – I’ll continue writing it even if no-one reads it because sometimes I can’t sleep until I get whatever it is out of my head. however, it would be lovely to have a few people who felt inspired to discuss my content… Lets say I’ll aim for 36 new followers / contributors in 2017, 20,000 views\n5.TEACHING – this is new to me, I’m loving it – teaching stained glass to members of the community as part of a funded Community Project – my goals are to be proud of the finished product, have it installed by the end of summer and to both blog and Vlog the process. My aim is to obtain another teaching commission for 2018\n6.STAINED GLASS ART- let’s get proactive instead of reactive. Last year I started thinking about Christmas stock mid October – about 3 months too late when I had zero old stock to sell and had to close by order book on 5th Dec because for some reason we decided a holiday before Christmas would be relaxing. It was. The run up to it was definitely not. So. START making Christmas glass in the summer.\n7.ALSO STAINED GLASS – I am really really bad at marketing myself, my skills and my ETSY shop (I bet you are thinking ” whoa, she has an Etsy shop?!”) – I looked at my Etsy shop today and all items have expired. I’ve not been updating my existing ‘made to order’ items or creating any new ones. Target – never have my shop empty. Create 2 new designs before summer (lets say end July). Anyway, here’s a link to the shop ..don’t look yet, I’ve written this but I haven’t done it yet, give me a few hours!!\n8. ALSO STAINED GLASS – my favourite moment in the artistic process is creating a new design and making it for the first time. I love most of all the commissioned one-off pieces. As an artist rather than a commercial maker, the fun and challenge is in the original design and the presentation of it to the individual who asked for it.That said I really need to focus on marketing myself as a designer and maker of one off commissioned glass panels… If I could get 3 more commissions for 2017 I’d be a very happy bunny.\n9.BED AND BREAKFAST – Cerdyn Villa is, in my mind small and perfectly formed . I love that we run it like we are having friends over. I love that we spend hours talking to our guests over breakfast or sharing our wine/beer in the garden on a rare warm sunny day. Yes its a business, but mostly its a lifestyle choice. What I wanted to do last year was to start running weekenders for like-minded people – eg: an artists retreat, a classic car enthusiasts retreat; that sort of thing. Basically fill our 3 rooms and maybe have 4 or 5 campers come along – welcome drinks evening around a bonfire, breakfast together, some form of group activity, an evening meal together, possibly everyone heading to the local pub together for a pint, some other activity and away they go – fulfilled, enlightened and loving our home and this little village. My target is to run a first one in 2017…In September *better warn hubby*\n10.ART – as an acrylic artist I am again pretty crap at self promotion. I would however be very happy to paint 2 more original spacescapes to add to my series and arrange for them to be exhibited somewhere before Christmas. I’m not a mass creator of sellable art I just want to follow my passion and paint these for me – but be brave enough to put them out there for others to look at.\n11.FACEBOOK. I amalgamated my art page (Pink Butterfly Art & Glass) and our B&B page (Cerdyn Villa B&B into one with a view to create a ‘lifestyle hub’ The page is Pink Butterfly Art & Glass at Cerdyn Villa B&B or @CerdynVilla – I’d love to grow that to 1000 likes.\n12.LIFESTYLE HUB – with so many facets to life I set up (with a lot of help from my friend and mentor, Dinah) a ‘one-stop-shop ‘Lifestyle Hub’ combining my blog, Facebook, B&B website, art and twitter into one place from where everything can be accessed. I need to make it more visible (how? – ok arrange more time with the gorgeous Dinah – for that but mostly for coffee and cwtches). Plus I promised I’d start a VLOG... so my target is to set up a VLOG!!!\nSo there you go. I shall continue fluttering about randomly rambling my way along but at the same time (yes I do plan to multi task), I shall keep my mind on these goals and moreover I shall report back in January on my success/failure/adaptations to the above.\nWish me luck, I’m going in!\nThat’s quite the list my dear – but all very achievable if you put your mind to it. I look forward to the result!\nLikeLike\ntime will tell! But I’m motivated thanks to people like you and your lovely blog/tweets and comments\nLikeLike\nI love your randomness Berni, and I love your bucket list too. I must admit the Coach in me is screaming “it’s too long and complicated” but, knowing you, you will achieve every single one – and then some! May I suggest you worry not a single jot about numbers on Social Media though; if I have learned one important thing on all the social media I use, it’s that quality not quantity is more true here than we think. I have loads of “followers” on Twitter, but in fact very few engagers, and they are what matter. My Engagers are fantastic and far more important to me as they are the people who share my posts, comment on my blogs, re-post things they know are important. They spread the message to the people you’re wanting to connect with. You may have them already. LOVE that you’re planning your first weekend themed B&B event. Let me know how I can help spread the word. Dxxx\nLikeLike\nI won’t be able to do it without you D x And one of my non-listed projects is the mural on your wall… when you are ready xxx\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nI’m so happy I inspired you to write your bucket list! You’ve got some great goals on it and I wish you all the best in achieving them. The stained glass sounds great and I love the idea of themed weekends at your B&B!\nDebbie\nLikeLike\nTHanks Debbie. I’m very much an amateur on the blogging and tweeting front. I don’t use any tools or planning aids – i know i should but I can’t get my head around the lack of spontineity. Plus I didn’t know there were so many tools available to me\nWill keep you informed! Hope you don’t mind!!!!\nLikeLike",

My aim (other than a bit of walking exercise and socialising) being to raise awareness of the Elections on 5th May and encourage people to vote.\nWhat became apparent was that people are confused ……\nNot surprisingly…\nIt is insanely confusing.\nThis Spring/Summer there are FOUR votes to cast. Two relating to Welsh Assembly, one relating to Police and Crime Commission and later on another one relating to the EU\nSome people I spoke to didn’t realise that the elections in May were not the EU referendum!!\nThose who have received their postal vote pack are overwhelmed by 3 separate ballot papers and 2 separate voting systems\nNo-one seems to have heard about the Police and Crime Commissioners\nAnd what the hell are Regional List Candidates anyway?!?!\nAs I said.. politics is complicated.\nIn the UK the system of voting is a First Past the Post System… it isn’t fair and it fails to represent the views of the majority, in fact it potentially could only represent the views of a tiny minority… read about it here , I’ve tried my best to keep it simple.\nUnlike Westminster constituencies, Assembly constituencies are grouped into electoral regions, and an “additional member system” is used to elect four additional Assembly Members from each region, in addition to the AMs elected by the constituencies. On the 5th May 2016, you have two votes for who represents you in The Senedd; one constituency vote and one regional party-list vote. Each constituency elects one AM using the first past the post system (that is, the individual with the most votes wins); the additional Assembly seats are filled from regional “closed party lists’, using an “averaging method” whereby the number of votes is divided by the number of constituency seats won ( d’Hondt method), this offers a degree of proportional representation within each region.\nAltogether, 60 AMs are elected from the 40 constituencies and five electoral regions, creating an Assembly of 40 constituency AMs and 20 additional AMs. So every constituent/voter is represented by one constituency AM and four regional AMs.\nAs for the 3rd ballot paper, well that’s for the Police and Crime Commissioner…. last time they held an election only 16% turned out to vote so I’m guessing they hope to get a better turnout by running it alongside the Assembly Elections…. But sorry, i have no idea who any of them are or why one might be better than the other… All I can say is that many people think it should not be a politically biased position at all…. Anyway. You vote for first and second choice and the top two from the first choice are then reviewed, if neither has more than 50% of the total then they look at the 2nd choice count for those 2 candidates….\nInsane? Confused? I did try to warn you\nIf you don’t usually vote, vote unusually\nEnjoyable read Bernie, and brilliantly put.\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_05_06_150-years-in-the-heart-of-wales/content_700.html": "Today celebrated 150 years of Llanwrtyd Wells Station.\nThings have changed a lot. Originally the Heart of Wales line ran multi-coach trains throughout each day bringing Victorian ladies and gentlemen, here to take the healing waters at the wells. It was a vibrant community with many shops and the line transported goods as well as people. It made the heart of the Heart of Wales accessible to All.\nThese days, whilst the station itself looks much the same, it only runs four single carriage trains each way each day. But its still an essential asset to our community.\nLlanwrtyd is at the central point of the Heart of Wales Line which runs between Shrewsbury and Swansea. It is the only real public transport we have and it connects us to the rest of the UK. My parents, for example, who live in Essex, visit us here at Cerdyn Villa, using the trains (Southend, London, Swansea, Llanwrtyd) and then a five minute stroll to our front door.\nThe station buildings have recently undergone a transformation as far as re-purposing is concerned. Community Transport have an office there. There are weekly community coffee mornings and the elderly are transported to and from here for their morning tea. And since the closure of our bank in the town aquare, Credit Union have set up a pay point in there , open every Tuesday and Thursday.\nInside there is a small IT suite with WIFI connectivity; a conference room and a sitting room filled with armchairs and sofas surrounding a lovely log burner. Then of course there’s a small kitchen so teas/coffees and snacks can be prepared.\nOutside there are well maintained gardens thanks to a group of volunteers from within the Llanwrtyd community, Friends of Llanwrtyd Station.\nToday, the station, community rooms and gardens hosted a celebration. There was a picnic and live music. The local school children from Ysgol Dolafon performed some beautiful country dancing. The last ever station master of Llanwrtyd Wells, John Davies, unveiled a plaque. Our Mayor, peter James, gave a speech. And of course, the obligatory raffle. (Anyone living in a small community knows that pretty much everything that happens is funded through the selling of raffle tickets!). Whatever was raised will be used to buy plants to keep the station looking as gorgeous as ever.\nI can recommend the Heart of Wales Line for a scenic train journey or as a practical mode of transport; and if you should find yourself stopping off here at the midway point, I’m only a stones throw a way, so book a room and stay the night, Llanwrtyd really is a relaxing place to be.",

The 2nd in a row in Blackpool and it’s likely to become a regular haunt . We have the perfect hosts both in our accommodation providers; The New Guilderoy Hotel, owned by Loony members (Baroness Chief Whip Guilderoy and Lord Guilderoy); and our venue, Uncle Toms Cabin where we are we welcomed with open arms by the staff and landlord who blend in, like professional loonies 😉\nWe also have Tony Davies, Loony Bus Driver who has access to and provides his services for our campaigning tour/ pub crawl ( !). The open top tour brings extra smiles to many a face and how doesn’t want to spread a little happiness\n….and then we have the Firework Festival, Comedy Carpet and magnificent esplanade along the seafront\nThe weekend was filled with smiles, music and laughter ….and lashings of alcohol. We were entertained by Loony Bands… The B.U.M.S (Border Urban Morris Side)… who include amongst its Loony members, Baron Von Magpie Bum , Honey Bum and the Party’s youngest standing candidate, Hugo Shovit. then there were The Big Fibbers (both Loonies: Knigel Knapp and Tristian Shout); BB Blackdog (lead singer and founder, Loony member, Lieutenant Jager Schnitzel); plus we had great music from Loony Sympathisers; both Badaxe (with a personal tribute to our great\nLeader, Howlin’ Laud Hope) and The Wattingers performed unbelievable “you had to be there” sets. And let’s not forget the magnificent Full Fat Boogie Band who got us dancing and wearing even more hats with their two sets on our first night.\nThere was a conference bit… the bit where we patted ourselves on our backs for our successes in the Welsh Assembly Elections; achieving a party first in qualifying for an Election Broadcast. We discussed our standing candidate in David Cameron’s old constituency of Witney ; that will be our very own Mad\nHatter…wishing him every success on the campaign trail. It was also noted that we are the ONLY political party not in the red… we are solvent and work within our means. Plus we are about to appear in the Guiness book of World Records as having the longest-serving party leader (17 years ) Howlin’ Laud Hope, who has just beaten the previous record holder, Loony founder , Lord Sutch, to the title. It is also being considered as to whether he is the longest standing political leader in the world to have been democratically elected.\nYes as ever, Loonies are leading the way!!

I’m pacing. Ordinarily in these restless situations I’d run myself a deep bath, take a glass of milk with me and babble at you from my bathtub.\nAt the moment though a long soak is not allowed. I’m on shallow dips and wet wipes washing only.\nAll because of a momentary lapse of concentration and a falling out with a large container full of bolognaise.\nIf you are squeamish do not read on. This post contains graphic images.\nIt’s Saturday and my house is buzzing with friends from afar here to party with me for my fiftieth birthday. If you read my blogs you will know that it’s been long in the planning and I’m pretty much excited to the point of bursting. I will wax lyrical the excellence of the evening despite this ‘hiccup’ in a separate story… This tale shall be referred to in homage to the hilarious Simon Peggy movie, Hot Fuzz, as ‘It’s Only Bolognaise’….\nSix p.m..ish and I’m flitting between shower, kitchen, makeup, kitchen getting myself ready and a hot buffet heated for anywhere between 30-70 people… I have no idea how many will arrive here for pre-party cocktails and some beer soaking Bolognaise’…. I have a house already buzzing with friends and family who have been arriving since Friday morning. We had a pre party party on Friday night and have spent Saturday chilling chatting and prepping for this evening. There’s a distinct buzz in the air and the mood is good. ….\n…and then there’s an almighty scream from the kitchen as I remove a large tub of bolognaise sauce from the microwave. Having saved time and washing up by reheating it in the tub I froze it in, the said tub not being microwave proof has lost its rigidity in the heating process. As I lift it from the microwave the sides fold in on themselves and the boiling Bolognaise’ volcanoes out of the tub and over my chest into my cleavage and bra.\nThings happen in a blur from here. I’m ripping off my clothes running up the stairs and diving into the shower. Female family members are dashing in and out , taking control, trying not to look concerned urging me to stay under the icy flow. Twenty minutes I’m there. People come and go. Hubby arrives back from prepping the party venue to find the house in crisis.\nI’m in the shower, chest red raw from being scalded. Worrying only about missing or spoiling the party. I’m calm as you like. But every time I step out of the icy flow of water the burning pain in my chest rises. All I can think about is whether the food will be ready for my guests and not wanting any downers on the evening… I’m worrying that I’ve thrown the timing out for the evening plans!!!\nEveryone else is worrying about me.\nOut of the shower and it’s ice packs for the next hour. People are coming and going. Aloe vera appears. Several people suggest a visit to MIU (minor injuries unit).\nVarious people wander in to assess my chest……..\nMeanwhile I’m holding tea-towels full of ice on my tits whilst trying to apply makeup to my face and do my hair.\nI refuse MIU. Various people have checked NHS direct and various other sites. A friend / first aider arrives.\nI am not going to MIU! I refuse to miss my party.\nThe heat has dissipated. I have a high-necked party dress, aloe vera and paracetamol and I intend to PARTY…..\n… Party was amazeballs magnificent (see next blog).\n….I’m blistering and the skin is blacking. I still have a zillion people here….. I slavver on the aloe vera . I’m not in any pain but my chest is definitely not looking pretty.\nBy the evening there’s flaking and blistering but also the skin is tightening and pulling. I’m having to sleep tonight sitting up and as such am not sleeping. ..\nI go to MIU\nApparently I did most things right …except of course going to MIU straight away …\n…and wrapping myself in clingfilm…\nI return like this … Eight layers of gel dressing topped with padded wound dressings, all being held in place by a tube bandage boob tube. …\nI think we can all agree that it’s somewhat optimistic to stick a 50-year-old F-cup chest in a boob tube…. I feel I need to hold it in place or lay down to prevent gravity doing its worse…\nUPDATE:\nThe next day I return for the lovely nurse at MIU, Jo, to redress the wounds. Apparently, according to her and Hubby they are looking much better. Who knew Jo had hidden talents in dress making. Today the tube bandage is a vest top. My chest no longer has to defy gravity alone!\nToday my fashionista nurse, decided we could replace the bulky gel dressing with something lighter weight.\n…. note the fetching collar detail and central stitching…\nIt looks like i’ll be back and forth to Llandrindod Wells Memorial Hospital for a few days. Thank goodness for local community hospitals and their fantastic staff. Hopefully I’ll be out of bandages soon\nOh my goodness! Now that’s dedication! I love how you were still worried about the food while everyone else is worried about you, that would totally be me. Glad it’s healing and the boob tube situ got sorted! #BlogCrush\nLikeLike\nWhat a way to celebrate your 50th! That looks incredibly painful, I have no idea how you managed to carry on for so long. I hope you heal soon x #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nOuch!!! Holy cow i cant imagine how sore that would have been – kudos for carrying in regardless #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nYour tale of burning gravy/sauce reminds of why “It’s so much easier being a guy” is one of my favorite sayings. Good luck healing.\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_08_25_free-nonthinking/content_555.html": "A very good friend of mine advocates ‘No Box Thinking’ . In fact , in a past chapter of her eclectic life, she wrote and delivered seminars about it. I’ve not seen her seminar…perhaps I should watch it, I’m sure there’s a video or podcast out there somewhere.\nAnyway, the premise is based around forgetting the sales/marketing propaganda of ‘thinking outside the box’ and instead just get rid of the damned box. Sounds like perfect sense to me. In fact I thought I lived by this very premise: not pigeon holing life; not following set paths. I really believed that not only did I agree with the overarching idea, but that I was successfully both teaching that ideology to my son and leading by example. I really thought I was living without a box.\nThen I went away for a couple of nights and realised that whilst I live outside of the ‘norm’ and largely don’t conform by walking the marked paths of progress and expectation; my life, like most people’s, has become so full and busy that I only see outside the near peripheries of what I already do.\nMy boxes may be large and colourful, and not particularly cuboid, but they still exists. I’m still constrained by them.\nA few hours into a car journey towards a rare 2 days off for a little R&R and my busy little mind wandered off ; it meandered outside of its normal constraints and met up with some random ideas and options.\nI thought I had life sussed, but I realise now that my life lacks one vital ingredient for ‘no box thinking’ … that ingredient is best described as ‘Nothing time’; moments of time where the mind is not processing data; not reviewing existing projects and ‘to do’ lists; not worrying about outstanding commitments; pressing engagements; the shopping; the cleaning; the kids; work ; phone calls that should have been made; emails that need to be sent; letters that need to be composed. I’m talking about those rare moments when your mind is silent.\nPerhaps silent is the wrong word. I mean moments when the butterfly cage of the mind is opened and the butterfly can flutter off and explore the wider landscape and take an aerial view of life.\nPrecious moments of free (non)thinking have broadened my horizons. I’ve viewed my landscape from way above the ceiling I’m normally constrained by and as such I’ve spotted a few more paths worth exploring.\nLike me, you may already have a life full of joy and activities; love and fun; as well as work and routine. Like me you may not crave anything else: BUT I challenge you to afford yourself some nothing time, a few moments of free (non)thinking, and see where your imagination might take you…….\nDinah Liversidge is now a small holder, country dweller, crafter, active community member, wedding celebrant, motivator and general super cool superstar of a woman living in rural wales and I am lucky enough to call her my friend. In a past life chapter she was a life coach and mentor and ocasionally she slips back into it both officially and unofficially. She once mentioned to me her program of no box thinking and it stuck in my head. When i am lucky enough to have her to myself for a few hours, i find her inspirational. i never leave from time with her without a spark alight in my mind and the ideas and energy just flows from there. we may not even have been talking about the project i become motivated to do.; but I am always more alive and more motivated after some time with her… you can find her here... or here…\nOne thought on “Free (non)Thinking…”",
  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_11_13_cloudy-with-a-slight-chance-of-rain/content_95.html": "” this winter COULD see an apocalyptic invasion of alien zombies , bringing catastrophic untreatable viruses which will result in a 51% CHANCE of UP TO 90% of the population dying a slow and painful death. Coupled with the POSSIBILITY of the recent POLAR VORTEX warning and the POTENTIAL of UP TO 50MM of BLIZZARD like snow CYCLONES I recommend the stockpiling of SPAM and SUGAR to avoid being too late due to PANIC buying and SERIOUS SHORTAGES throughout the UK”\nOk so I made that up but these days it appears that weather reporters; TV, newspapers, radio, internet; can say just about anything about anything as long as it is preempted by “could see”, “up to” or be reflected as an arbitrary percentage. When was it that media terrorism became so excessive? I’m talking weather here but other issues apply; think bird flu; Ebola; immigration; education; pedophilia – just about any topic and try to get to the real truth, the balanced reality and the facts…. it’s almost impossible . Its amazing anyone ever leaves their house these day through fear of being kidnapped, murdered, run over by a drunk driver, catching an incurable disease or dying of sunstroke.\nEven in what I would describe as recent history, (say the 70’s and 80’s) the weather was reported using a map and some graphics; smiley sun, sun half hidden by stylised cloud, cloud with one/two/three raindrops. Nothing excessive or threatening – just some science based predictions communicated to us in an informative way.\nNowadays reports include words like “threatened”, “warnings”, “unprecedented” “paralysing’ . And the imagery is more spectacular. Hard-hitting even. ‘Traffic light’ coded symbols advise us, no, warn us, that we’re likely to burn/ freeze/ drown/ have horrific allergic reactions. If its sunny old people are ‘warned’ to stay in doors; if its likely to snow they re told there is danger of being ‘trapped’. Wind is always a hurricane, gale or blizzard. Rain is measured in millimeters for maximum effect. Two inches became 5 cm when we went metric , recently its reported as 50mm. Or if it’s the Daily Mail /Express etc its: ” possibly in excess of 50mm maybe even up to 100mm…”\nThe use of language to sensationalise the situation and the continued use of superlatives to add dramatic effect is getting out of control. That, coupled with the overall need of the media to scare-monger causes several problem – here’s a few:-\n1.. The elderly and vulnerable become more fearful and less mobile\n2. Businesses (eg UK tourism) suffer\n3. the average person is not prepared when bad weather really does come – I’m talking about ‘crying wolf’\n4. and, possibly most importantly, the English language is running out of superlatives!\nTodays report. (thanks to The Express) “POLAR VORTEX WARNING – UK faces MONTHS of HEAVY snow!!!!” that true folks – Polar Vortexes – be afraid, be very afraid. apparently “A series of RARE atmospheric events” is set to “PLUNGE Britain into the WORST WEATHER of modern times”… I have no idea how modern times are, however the effect will be “..heavy snow PARALYSING the entire country”.\nScared yet?\nMy advice is this: sand bags, blankets (lots), old wooden furniture (to burn when the pending weather trauma causes the associated blackouts), candles ( for the same reason), Spam, sugar and flour stockpiling (supermarkets may not be able to get deliveries and this will result in food shortages); fill every pan with water (to prevent shortages due to the inevitable burst pipes and unmanageable pressure on plumbers), more wine/beer/vodka (to combat boredom) and condoms – plenty of condoms (ask your gran what happened during the blackouts).\nKeep warm, keep safe and take everything you read/hear with a pinch of salt (assuming you’ve remembered to stockpile some 😉 ) and maybe look out of your window more, use your own judgement (remember how we all used to be able to do that) and make an informed decision based on reality and commonsense.\n… oh, and whatever the weather, do try to make the most of it….. but watch out for alien invaders……",

Her and my step son are wonderful parents. They are attentive and relaxed. They give their son all the time and input they can. He is being raised in a loving home with able parents. He is being raised in a bi-lingual environment, he will be able to speak English and Mandarin. He is clearly healthy, weighing in at 9.6 kg and being in the 93rd percentile on the length/height charts. He’s strong, active and on target or ahead on all the NHS measurements for growth and development. These new parents follow all the rules…..\n…and therein lies a problem. The bloody RULES. Not guidelines. Rules.\nWhen I had my son 20 years ago, solids were introduced at 3 months. By just shy of 3 months I was desperate to feed my son something more than breast milk. He was obviously always hungry and I and hubby were obviously always tired. It was zombie-like in our home. The rules now say no solids until 6 months. SIX MONTHS!!!! Our grandson is the size of some 1 year olds. He is happy, smiley , active and healthy. He is also hungry every 30 minutes throughout the night.\nThis week we visited and I had a chance to reiterate the story of our son, and to properly offer suggestion that they might dare to break the RULE. So at 5 months and 3.5 weeks my daughter-in-law felt brave enough to break the health visitors rules and she fed solids to our grandson. He slept. She slept. For the first night in almost 6 months she slept in her own bed and not with the baby. Normal life can continue.\nHealth visitors, PLEASE, treat each baby and family as individuals. Stop spouting general rules. It’s not always helpful, beneficial or in the best interest of the baby and parents.\nWhat a gorgeous boy he is! Ha ha – the rules. Yes it can feel like diktats from health visitors sometimes can’t it?! The ‘guidelines’ changed from 4 months to 6 months when my eldest was a baby so we split the difference and went for 5 months. I think we did similar with the twins too but I can’t really remember it was all a bit of a blur when they were little! Enjoy your beautiful grandson. #thesatsesh xx\nLikeLike\nOh I empathise with your step son and wife. I had a super hungry baby with the second eldest though seems to have stayed with him !!!\nLikeLike\nI gave Dee some baby rice mixed with breast milk a couple of days before she turned 6 months. It didn’t help her sleep at all! Health visitors have to have some general guidelines and they’re usually evidence based. As long as parents are informed though then of course they can make their own decisions about what’s best for their baby and their situation.\nLikeLike\nSo cute x\nLikeLike",

I thought I was sick. I feel sure I had a hormone related migraine. Do you get them.? When I get them, which is not every month but when I do they always fall just before a period. (A joyous additional PMT symptom that provides more proof that should I believe in a god I would be sure it would be male! ) Sometimes they’re full on agonising headache; where a dark room isn’t dark enough; where the pressure is so great I vomit. Sometimes they just mess with my mental dexterity; I can’t string a sentence together, I can’t process the words i see into words i read and understand; I can’t balance, my spacial awareness is fucked. If you get them you will recognise the joys.\nI’m hot. Or I’m cold. I wake up in a pool of sweat. My entire body hurts. When I sleep my legs hurt and wake me up. My arms go numb. (Yes I’ve tried turning the mattress and yes I’ve got myself a new pillow…)\nI’m irritable and irrational. Small things are overwhelming.\nI’m finding it difficult, nigh on impossible, to concentrate. I can’t process information. My coordination is shot. I keep forgetting things. Instantly. Like the dinner I was in the middle of cooking. Or the soldering iron I switched on to heat up. Or who is on the end of the ringing phone of the call I’m making.\nThis week I’ve been awake when I should be asleep. Asleep when I should be awake.\nI’ve wanted to scream at so many people. I’ve burnt things. I’ve dropped things.\nMaking a meal has been a taxing task. I love cooking. I manage cafes, I run a B&B, I entertain friends. I’ve mis-timed, undercooked, overcooked, left out basic ingredients (the cheese from the cheese sauce for example)..\nI’m tearful. I’m angry. I’m frustrated. I’m stressed.\nDid I mention I want to scream at people? Yep. grrrr\nI am totally not me. I’m this other.\nSome of it is PMT. But at my age, some of it is (peri) menopausal. Some of it is possibly because for some reason I’ve stopped taking my happy pills. Come on. So many of us suffer from stress and anxiety. Modern society has created a lifestyle and human condition that means a disproportionately large number of us in the ‘developed’ world have illnesses relating to seratonin imbalance. I’ve been taking a very low level dose for years and years. I always tell my doctor I don’t want to find out what I’d be like without it and so on it I remain. But I think, and I don’t know why, I’ve stopped remembering to take it. Or have chosen to punish myself by denying myself it. I don’t know or understand. All I know is that this week I am losing a grasp on me and not liking the person infiltrating the missing space.\nIt’s like every pebble is a boulder; every crack is a crater; and every small task is a monumental effort.\nMy agitation levels are off the scale\nThank goodness that this week Debbie from My Random Musings posted the interview I did with her on her bloggers corner…. THAT PERSON IS ME… THIS PERSON IS AN UNWELCOME IMPOSTER.\nGo and read about the real me. I’ll find her again myself in the next few days I’m sure. But until I do my rose-tinted reality is sadly hidden under a thick rough grey blanket….\nhttps://www.myrandommusings.co.uk/2018/03/bloggers-corner-berni-rose-tinted-ramblings/\nUgh, again you are speaking my own words. I am more cold than hot these days…shivering away from the inside out. Eventually it turns into a blasted heat flash usually around 3 am. I wake in a pool of sweat never to return to my unpeaceful slumber. And the mood swings. The acne break outs. The cramping. The facial hair that sprouts from nowhere. The indescribable body odor. The fluctuating libido that leaves my husband so confused! The debilitating fatigue that causes days to be lost as I am a lump on the couch. Oh, merry menopause, how I abhor thee! Thank you for sharing your experience and talking about it! We need to not feel alone on this female journey!\nShelbee\nhttp://www.shelbeeontheedge.com\nLikeLike\nI hope you get to feeling like your regular self soon Berni! I loved your interview on Debbie’s site. #DreamTeam\nLikeLike\nI feel your pain for you and a little for me too. Empathise with your stage in life and it is such a weird mix waiting for that last period and hoping in some ways you were younger and could have a second go at it all. Main thing is that being overwhelmed by stuff I would have taken in my stride not that long ago. Hoping you feel better soon and you always help others when you post so honestly #AnythingGoes\nLikeLike\nGood morning gorgeous,\nI’m sorry to read that you’re having a hard time – seems like this is a monthly occurrence that is getting worse in per-menopause. I wish I could help,\nAll I can say, having now had 12 months period free, it WILL pass. It WILL pass. I promise. Bloody awful going through it and I’m always here to listen and hug if that helps.\nSending love and hope you have a wonderful time with Sue today. Sorry I cannot make it work this time – a bit more notice and I’m in for a small group.\nLove Dxxx\n>\nLikeLike\nI hope you feel better soon. Sometimes life just gets a bit too much and the imposter crawls into our lives and into our personalities. I hate it.\nI do, however, absolutely love “Empereal” it is a beautiful painting. Pen x #AnythingGoes\nLikeLike",

There are a set of rituals and traditions that have been built on year on year that make the extended weekend something of a marathon celebration. An excuse for a three night / 4 day party with friends; late nights, live music, over indulgent food (chocolate) consumption and so much dancing and laughter my belly hurts. Tuesday has become a day of recovery.\nThe Music Beer Walk weekend centred around the Neuadd Arms Hotel took centre stage for much of the weekend. Friday/Saturday/Sunday evening and even some of those afternoons too. There was a wealth of communal singing and playing with informal jamming and plenty of musicians and punters just having a good old knees up … there were some ‘proper’ performances too. Great Irish/Welsh folk music by Pretty in Pink; acoustic folk, pop, rock, blues covers by String Motion; and good old electric rock and blues with Dangerous Dave and Friends.\nBetween sessions in the pub were indulgent roast dinners with our boys , their partners and friends; board games; Easter egg hunts (yes 20 and 30 year old ‘children’ do still want you to hide chocolate around the garden for them to find) . The only difference is there’s more swearing; harder hiding places and some serious negotiations and power plays when the final bounty is collected and compared!\nEaster Sunday always comprises of our friends annual egg rolling and feasting afternoon. We (friends of all ages from toddlers to retired) gather and colour in our designs on hard boiled eggs over cups of tea. We stroll to a local hill, scramble to the top and hurl the eggs down. If yours doesn’t break then its back up the hill for you. Last one to break or furthest unbroken egg after four or so assaults on the summit wins a prize. Its then back to their house of a heavily chocolate based buffet to which we all contribute (this year I made a chocolate orange cointreau cake – recipe attached); we all help hide eggs around the garden for the little kids and then we pass the rest of the afternoon playing silly games – egg roulette, egg catch, hula hooping the maltesa slide and various other made up games that generally involve chocolate.\nAnyway, here’s me with a rather handsome Easter Bunny….\n…and here’s the recipe for my chocolate orange cointreau cake (other orange liqueurs are available)….\nChocolate Orange Cointreau Cake – easy peasy to make\n9oz self raising flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n6oz caster sugar\n4 eggs\nrind and juice of 2 oranges\n1oz cocoa\n5oz sunflower oil\n2 tablespoons golden syrup\n4oz plain chocolate (grated)\n6 tablespoons cointreau\nplace all the ingredients in a large bowl and blend well for a few minutes.\nline a loose bottomed tin , pour in the mixture\nbake on a gas 3/320F/160C for 45 mins or until risen and away from the edges\ncool.\neat!\nyou can thank me later……\nHow did you spend your Easter ?\nLooks like so much fun has been had! I love the Brown Eyed Girl clip everyone looks so happy and I love that song! Thanks for linking up with us for #ablogginggoodtime\nLikeLike\ngreat isn’t it – i love it so much x\nLikeLike\nUmm, so you have the best Easter weekend fun EVER! This all sounds so amazing, the food, the games..everything!xx #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nwe do seem to have created an annual event filled long weekend 😉\nLikeLike\nPlease can I come to your house next Easter? It sounds AMAZING! If I did all the fun things you do at Easter I too would still insist on an egg hunt at age 30 (if I was still 30… which I’m not… boo! 😉). The cake sounds delicious. Happy belated Easter lovely x\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nyou should definitely come along the kids will love it but so will the big kids -(mums/dads)\nLikeLike\nIt looks like you’ve been having a blast. That orange cake sounds divine. I love alcohol in food so it’s right up my street!! x\nLikeLike\nlet me know what you think if you make it\nLikeLike\nI simply adore a chocolate orange, so I will definitely be giving your recipe a try very soon #blogginggoodtime@_karendennis\nLikeLike\nlet me know how you get on x\nLikeLike",

It’s all part of a new year initiative to get us all creating and it seems to be working. Hundred, if not thousands of individuals from all walks of life, of all ages, have joined together and created a community, forging friendships, sharing stories of joy and misadventure; and bolstering each others confidence and sense of wellbeing.\nOne artist (me) from a little rural village in the middle of the middle of Wales said, “Yesterday was wonderful, I spent the whole day thinking about the challenge and checking in but i just could not get my head around it. I don’t know why, maybe lack of sleep, maybe because I don’t wear jumpers, anyway I just could not get creative over the ‘jumper challenge’ so i just came clean to the group,. They supported me through it. Another artist, Ven, even created one for me ! How great is that! It gave me a nice warm fuzzy feeling. Well I guess jumpers do that: especially when you’re from America and finally realise that a ‘jumper’ is really a ‘sweater’ and not a pinafore… and they say we speak the same language!\nAs the January Challenge embarks on its second week , people are already excited about what the organisers at 64 Million Artists have in store for them but say they’re up for the challenges and to keep them coming…\nThis is Berni Benton from llanwrtyd Wells, saying goodbye for now and see you next time\nPress notes:\ntaken from their FB page….\n64 Million Artists is a charity campaigning to unlock the creative potential of every human being in Britain. It began life as 53 Million Artists in 2014 and they’ve been working with people all over the country to help them get creative on their own terms, celebrating their passion and flair and encouraging them to Do, Think and Share\nWere you always told you couldn’t sing? Draw? Write? Dance? Cook? We’re here to tell you different.\n64 Million Artists is about having a go, not about being an expert. We’re inviting everyone in Britain to do something new and celebrate their creativity, to be proud of their passion, and show their flair.\nWhy not join in, it doesn’t matter that you missed the start …. www.dothinkshare.com\nFurther notes:\nEach challenge only needs to take 5-10 minutes. Its not about the quality of the work its more about the thought process and how it made you feel… getting us all to be a bit more mindful…\nToday is day 8 the challenge: “Breaking News – My Life”\nDO: What is your day to day life like? Pretend you’re a news reporter and report on your day. It can be a video of you telling us what you’re getting up to today, a cooking show for when you’re making your dinner, a newspaper article with key headlines for the day or just a series of photos. If you do choose to do a video report you don’t have to show your face – we just want to see what everyone is getting up to today!\nTHINK: Did your day turn out differently than you expected it to? Did you feel comfortable filming your every day life?\nSHAREShow us your day!\nFacebook Page: 64millionartists\nClosed Facebook Group: 64 Million Artists – The January Challengers\nInstagram: 64millionartists\nTwitter: @64M_Artists\nWebsite: www.dothinkshare.com/submit\nIF YOU HAVE MORE TIME ; Create a report at the end of the day, how is your day different to when you started it? Did you complete the tasks you set out to do? Did it turn out to be completely different than expected?\nOoh interesting concept! Anything that makes us more creative and mindful is great in my opinion! Thank you for linking this to #DreamTeam!\nLikeLike\nThis sounds like an amazing challenge to take part in, I hope you enjoy it and it’s very successful! #DreamTeam\nLikeLike\nThat’s just amazing. I love it when something brings so many people together! That on it’s own is incredible. Looking forward to seeing some of the pictures! Thank you for linking up with #globalblogging\nLikeLike\nits proving to be a great kick start to 2018\nLikeLike\nWhat a neat idea! I know I couldn’t commit to doing something like this every day, but I love the focus on creative potential! Are you sharing all that you’re doing on social media?\n~Jess\n#GlobalBlogging\nLikeLike\nyes, i’m sharing every day , even when i have nothing to show, i’m sharing my thoughts on the challenge usually on the 64MillionArtists – The January Challengers FB group x thoroughly enjoying it\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2018_01_21_new_beginnings/content_177.html": "Thirteen years ago next week Hubby and I, and our then seven year old son moved from the hectic hustle and bustle of city life in the busy East of England to a tranquil rural setting in the Heart of Wales. In fact we about as in the middle of Wales as you can get, in the smallest town in the UK, Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys.\nWe happened upon Llanwrtyd in a frantic need for respite from the stresses of Hubby’s corporate life and ended up sticking a pin in a map on a page of nothingness. We came for two night’s refuge and didn’t go home.\nThere was light over that horizon. For hubby the time BLW (Before Llanwrtyd Wells) was never ending commutes; road rage; and stressful, unsatisfying work environment. It was unhealthy, unforgiving, and it was slowly breaking him.\nWhen we arrived in LW that wet weekend evening we chanced upon a little bistro with no other customers barr one friendly Welshman, who happened to be the ex headmaster of the village school, and an eager pupil, meeting him for some additional education support. We chatted for ages. The next day, also rainy, we perused the properties for sale, daydreaming of our distant retirement. And the next day we did a bit more than window shop and went viewing a few cute houses.\nThat night we talked and talked and talked. Why were we waiting until our retirement to live our lives? What if we didn’t make it there? What about the quality of life for our son, educated in overcrowded classrooms in Essex, unable to play outside alone etc etc?\nThe next day a blazing orange sun rose over the horizon and lit our future path. We put an offer on the house. We handed in our notice at our respective places of work. We pulled our son out of school. That was October 2004. On 4th February 2005 we drove towards the light of our new future.\nAnd we have never looked back.\nThirteen years on we have a successful and welcoming guesthouse with lots of lovely customers who repeatedly visit; maybe for our warm welcome , wholesome breakfasts and cosy beds; maybe for the respite, tranquility and magnificent scenery; probably a bit of both.\nWe have a wonderful community, a network of very special friends and a full and fabulous social life and work/life balance.\nOur son was raised on freedom, damming rivers, climbing trees and disappearing from breakfast to supper. He would come home with a sparkle in his eyes and stories of adventures with his friends. He went to a village junior school with 50 kids and mixed aged classes which promoted tolerance and mentoring. He went to a high school of 700 pupils where he had to travel daily by public transport. And now he’s thriving in Wales’s capital, the beautiful historic city of Cardiff. When he can, which is often , he comes home. Because home is where the hills are, where the stars shine bright a night; where, when you look to the horizon, you are met with green pastures, trees and mountains; pink sunsets and deep orange sunrises. Where you can walk or run or cycle for hours without seeing a soul; or where you can pop into the local pub or cafe and start a conversation with any number of friendly locals who happen to be there.\nLife should be a journey, an adventure. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. We are lucky enough to be living every moment of it. And we are more lucky because we are able to share insights into it and the possibilities of a less then ordinary life to anyone who chooses to come and take a peak. You are more than welcome to visit.\nLife with a view of the horizon\nWow. That’s a really inspiring read and fantastic to hear that it worked out so well for you all. I’m in complete awe that you just went out to Wales one day, and stuck to what your heart was telling you. Thanks for sharing with the #DreamTeam\nLikeLike\nIt looks like a truly beautiful place to raise a family! #GlobalBlogging\nLikeLike\nWow! How brave of you to just up sticks and move to the middle of nowhere! It sounds amazing though, and like you made absolutely the right decision for your family 🙂 #BloggerClubUK\nLikeLike\nWhat an inspiring story your life is! Sounds wonderful. Such a good decision. #bloggerclubuk\nLikeLike\nA fantastic read. I can connect to this post and am already thinking of moving out of a town into the countryside either Lake District, Wales or Cornwall when i retire. Would love to do it now but it isn’t quite possible for us. Such fantastic, stunning countryside, well done for taking the plunge. Ian\nLikeLike\nA brave move and it paid off — perfect!\nLikeLike\nOh what a lovely read. We did something similar 3 years ago, moving from the hustle and bustle of city life to a semi-rural property. We don’t regret it for a second either 🙂 #AnythingGoes\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nWhat an amazing story, you took such a brave leap and it obviously was the most wonderful decision! Lovely read and I’d love to come and visit, just a hop and a skip across the Irish sea! #anythinggoes\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThis sounds absolutely divine. I would love to live in the country – working towards getting a remote job which would let me do this. The idea of waking up and just being able to go out into the hills is an inspiring one.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThank you for sharing this! It’s amazing that you were able to decide this way in such an important question.\nI appreciate you because of this courage. I wish I would be so brave and make such a change – escaping from the busy world 🙂 until then remains the imaginery alternative world in the evenings 🙂\nCongrats!\nLikeLike\nBeautiful area and photographs.\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_06_22_what-makes-the-perfect-wedding/content_276.html": "I feel compelled to try to vocalise (in print!) the wedding experience of this week. I’ve never been married , I’ve been to a scattering of weddings; all beautiful and perfect for the respective couple; all memorable for their uniqueness; investment of energy; time and thought; money; love; passion; location etc.\nI don’t know where I would begin if I had to plan a wedding (even assuming ££££ were no object) so I have great admiration for anyone who has made the commitment to get married and then kept it together enough to make all the planning decisions required to present for themselves and to their family and friends their representation of ‘the perfect day’. For me the thought of picking THE dress; never mind doing so several months before wearing it; is enough to give me a minor panic attack.\nI can see the appeal though having planned a garden party or two over a 6 month period, planning props and stage setting the garden; liaising with invitees to get some momentum going re costume and theme; making costumes; organising the music etc etc, but a wedding is a much bigger deal.\nMaybe though it’s a much bigger adventure.\nI’ve always thought that if I had a spare £10,£20, £30, £50 thousand in my bank there would be a million things I would feel the need to spend it on first… getting the chimney rebuilt; replacing my car for something reliable; clearing my immense credit card debt; finishing decorating the house after 12 years; filling the potholes in the drive; felling a few of the overgrown trees in the garden etc etc. Maybe I’m just not the marrying kind.\nFortunately, my nephew and his beautiful, now wife, are definitely the marrying kind. And having been on the periphery of privy to the planning I realise now that whatever the budget, it’s not just an expensive day; it’s a period of months/years of excitement; discussion; research; adventure; decision-making; stage setting; engaging with friends; window shopping; shopping; preparing; making things; talking about it; building excitement over it; looking forward to it; and sharing your joy with everyone you know. The day itself is a culmination of a long period of time and a lifetime of memories made.\nSo this week I attended ‘THE perfect wedding’\ntwo people whose destiny it is to be together forever\ngorgeous bride with THE perfect dress\ngroom with really funny friends who know how to recount a story\nreally attractive best friends to be bridesmaids, groomsmen, flower girls etc\nthe most idyllic location and some hot line to mother nature to provide the best weather\ncaterers who make food to die for\na cake that is a work of art\nthe most delightful bunch of family members and friends to share your day\nOh my god that cake 😍😍\nLikeLike\nI know!!!!\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2018_01_13_my-first-solo-exhibition-eek/content_308.html": "On Wednesday I finally set up my long-planned (I booked the space a year ago) , first ever solo art exhibition.\nI did what I always do when out of my comfort zone. I wear ALL the colours and blag it. So here I am heading out to the gallery (via the hairdresser) to meet the curator and set up my show.\nAnd here I am with talented illustrator and wonderful friend Amanda Rose , post hair transformation (thank you Sadie of Meraki Salon, Llandrindod Wells ), and somewhat more relaxed , having nearly finished the set up .\nSo that was Wednesday.\nFriday evening was Preview night. The venue, Amgueddfa Sir Faesyfed (Radnorshire Museum), in Llandrindod Wells, county town of Powys.\nIt’s a weird thing exhibiting your own work , well certainly so the first time, I can’t speak beyond that. The overwhelming feeling for me is embarrassment. I’m an untrained artist, other than some local community lessons both in art and in glass, I didn’t study it at school or university. Part of me thinks I’m going to be unveiled as a fraud or laughed at. Another part of me, the biggest, feels typically British… one does not invite ones friends around and layout their stuff and ask them to publicly say nice things about you and your things “Come on people, praise me!”. My fear that my lovely friends would come along and feel they had to be nice because I needed some positive affirmation (which I did/do) but which might not be genuine. I’m transported back to being a child and handing a picture to a parent with great pride, and as it’s blue tacked to the fridge door them saying “that’s lovely dear, what is it?!”.\nBut the other feelings I had by Friday evening other than fear and embarrassment, were excitement and pride. I was desperate for Hubby to walk into the room for the first time. He was genuinely emotional and very proud. I knew then that I’d done OK. Actually, I think I knew on Wednesday. The gallery space at the museum is fantastic, well-lit, good proportions, nice feeling. The curator, Will Adams, is fabulous, both in his skills and in his reassuring nature. My friend Sue helped me with pricing and then offered so generously to cater the event with some of her amazing canapes had provided oodles of encouragement and reassurance. Sues catering is second to none. She founded the business Tea ad Sympathy, which continues to offer excellent services in the Wiltshire areas even since she retired to Wales. Her and husband Paul arrived early too with said canapes and it was reassuring to get feedback on the exhibition from them before the arrival of others. Paul is an amazing wildlife artist in his own right (despite what he may say himself), his skills are incredible.\nThe evening was fabulous. I received so much support and it wasn’t just friends and people I knew . I’m going to leave you with a gallery of images from the night and you can decide for yourself. If you are in Mid Wales between now and 17th March, please do pop in and take a look. If you let me know you’re coming I will try to come and meet you for coffee and cake. The local Herb Garden Cafe is excellent for that sort of thing.\nPictures courtesy of Hubby, the museum, and good friend Craig….\n“Out of the Darkness, Comes the Light”\nWhen I began this body of work in 2014 it was as a result of the awe and emotion evoked when I looked out at the huge expanse of the dark night sky from my home in rural Mid Wales. There were so many more points of light and smudges in that darkness than I had ever seen before, having previously lived inner city. I would look up, with wonder at the prospect of the infinite new beginnings and endings; the energy that must be existing, living, dying and flowing beyond beyond.\nThen I started looking at images taken from space telescopes and felt a spiritual connection to all that light and energy exploding out of the darkness. These energetic outpourings millions/billions of years ago still shine bright today; still impact on the here and now. For every action, no matter how large or small has an impact. A smile, a frown, a wave, which road we take, which path we walk. Everything makes a difference.\nThey say that something as a small as the flutter of a butterfly wing may ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world…\nBernice Benton – acrylic and stained glass artist\nBefore moving to Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Mid Wales I felt there was ‘an artist within’. It wasn’t until I moved here with my partner and our son in 2005 that I felt I had the opportunity to explore and develop my creativity. We all say that our landscape inspires our art and creativity and it definitely does. By finding the time to connect to the earth and the sky, I also began to tune into my own inner rhythm; was more able to connect to those around me; and to follow my own energy patterns, which has enabled me to find a balance, joy and a vision I did not find before.\nI attended some art classes and stained glass sessions, and for those tutors I am truly grateful for their enthusiasm, inspiration and guidance. They gave me the basic tools, confidence and energy to explore and develop. The journey is far from over and for that I not only thank my surroundings, but the amazing people whose souls and personality have guided and enhanced my vision. If you are reading this you are probably one of them.\nEvery chapter of my life to date has led to this one. Those beyond will evolve from these now. Each moment that has been experienced, guides me through the here and now and forward into the light of my future.\nEverything is connected.\nWow, congratulations!! Your work is beautiful! xx #mondaystumble\nLikeLike\nCongrats for what you achieved!\nIt’s amazing 🙂\nLikeLike\nYour works are fantastic! Congratulations on the exhibition! I really enjoyed reading your “about” page, I love to connect with people who dare to be different!\nEmma xxx\nhttp://www.style-splash.com\nLikeLiked by 1 person\ndifferent is the new norm!!

From simply remembering songs/tunes/writers/performers through to singing or playing any musical instrument.\nI was the only child in junior school, where choir was compulsory, to be told I could mime the words. Something that had a profound effect on me throughout adolescence and adulthood until recently . I was always embarrassed to sing and would always mime. Now I blast it out and to hell with it. Everyone is entitled to sing , whether they are in tune or not, its good for the soul.\ni think about this a lot these days.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_03_30_its-more-than-just-a-communuty-class/content_940.html": "I have been lucky enough to have been asked to be the designer/co-teacher at a community stained glass project that began at the very beginning of 2017.\nIt’s a wonderful, energising and exciting project funded by Brecon Beacons National Park Sustainable Development Fund. Fitting into the Year of Welsh Legends, the project is to create a large stained glass window for Myddfai Hall to reflect the legends of Wales and the surrounding area to Myddfai, Carmarthenshire. See that big semi-circular window on the second floor? Its going there\nFour groups of six weeks. Two and a half hours a week. Subsidised classes teaching members of the community stained glass skills and then engaging them in the design and creation of, what is sure to be, a spectacular piece of Welsh art.\nThe ‘pupils’ learn the skills they need and are able to make their own glass designs as well as being part of the making of the big window.\nThe first six weeks we had fourteen people and they put forward their ideas they felt should be incorporated. We reviewed the Mabinogion for imagery and ideas. Some people drew others wrote down ideas, some printed off images they felt should be conveyed. With all ideas of these first fourteen I was tasked with creating an image that would translate into glass and convey all the aspects of Welsh Legend and Myddfai history the group felt pertinent. An amazing challenge and honour for me.\nBy week seven, the beginning of the second course, ten of the original fourteen remained, joined by another six. The cutting of the panel began alongside the teaching of the beginners and development of the ‘experienced’.. By week thirteen, which is where we are now, the beginning of the third course, everyone stayed on and we have been joined by four more.\nProgress on the panel is amazing. But more than that. We have developed a community. These talented individuals generally arrive early because they are now all friends and want to meet for coffee first or start on our or their projects asap. They reluctantly pack up to leave at the end, we often run on. They stay on after to have lunch together. They’re all friends on social media… and in ‘real’ life. They communicate and meet outside the classes. They share their joys and pains; encourage each other and bring each other joy.\nPlus they are all so proud (quite rightly) of their individual achievements and their involvement in this fantastic piece of art that they want to take pieces home to progress the project more quickly. They positively glow.\nAs one of their ‘teachers’ I find so much joy and pride in watching their joy and seeing their confidence develop. I too have new friends as a result.\nThe classes are a delight indeed. They’re filled with energy chatter and laughter. The pride in the projects, both individual ones and our group activity, are palpable. And, when the panels are finally installed, sometime in June 2017, they will be there as a permanent reminder of individual development, teamwork, talent, achievement and friendship. That moment , when we reveal our ‘masterpiece’ will be…… indescribable… when we get their though, i will try my best ….\nWow, I love the design of the window, and what a great project! Looks like it’s giving a lot to a lot of people. You are very talented! #BlogCrush\nLikeLike\nThis class has changed me. I’m obsessed. Nothing gets in the way of Wednesdays.\nIt’s pure bliss spending hours, working with and learning from so many incredible women. Bernie and Lesley are so proactive. Feel blessed to be involved in such a stunning project,\nLikeLike\nThoroughly enjoying this course with everyone. Such a worthwhile project that has brought together so many different people! I really look forward to Wednesdays and don’t want it to end! Thank you. Jane x\nLikeLike\nBerni you are spot on! This class has been so very, very much more than I ever anticipated. I have made new friends, discovered skills I never thought I had, and developed a new passion for my community. I love Wednesdays so much and look forward with real joy every week to seeing the progress on the window. As my confidence grows, I am discovering my artistic side more than I thought possible. You are a wonderful teacher and friend. Thank you. Dinah xxx\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_11_20_special-occasions/content_354.html": "Yesterday was my birthday. I love birthdays. I know some people don’t like them and have an issue with their age. I don’t care about that – I LOVE birthdays. Not because of the presents, although they are lovely, but because of the sentiment and the increased communication and the whole joy of celebration.\nBefore I go on I will just recap about my wonderful birthday celebrations.\nFor me they always begin with the Llanwrtyd Wells Real Ale Wobble – so good of my home town to put on a beer festival and live entertainment for my birthday!\nJohn’s birthday is on the 5th, mine the 19th November. In recent years we’ve chosen to give each other the birthday treat of a night or two away. Or similar. This year we booked a hotel room in Cardiff and some theatre tickets. We did it some months ago, affording us time to enjoy contemplating how lovely it would be prior to the experience itself.\nSo 18th over to the 19th, after all the hard work of a busy B&B weekend, we meandered our way to Cardiff. We mooched around quirky boutiques, old record shops, vintage stalls and cafes with homemade cakes. We then lazed in the Novotel, had a lovely meal and walked along the Atlantic Wharf to the Millennium Centre where we belly laughed our way through Paul Merton and chums doing improv. After which we found a cute little wine bar and perched ourselves on bar stools discussing items on our bucket lists. A taxi back to the hotel ‘cos my feet were killing me. More wine. Box of chocolates. Etc etc. In the morning a lovely late breakfast a leisurely regrouping of our possessions a repacking of all our new purchases and a sunny drive home over the snow-capped Beacons.\nBirthdays, seem to be occasions where our minds find time to focus upon individual friends and family members. If only for a minute or two. This is even more true with the increased access to each other via social media. Just for a moment you remember that person whose birthday reminder has popped up and you have the opportunity to wallow in a happy memory and you spare a moment and type something like ” Happy Birthday x” or “good to know you’re still alive” or” have one on me” or similar.\nWhat it really says is “I may not often (or ever) see you but I remember you fondly and I take comfort in knowing you are out there somewhere”. What could be more lovely than to be remembered by people of whom you too have fond memories ?\nHi Bernice, Wishing you a very happy birthday for yesterday. I have had reconstruction of my foot So feet up and what to do. for the next 6 weeks. I hope all is well with the family. Lots of love Lucy\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_01_31_hair-raising/content_1823.html": "I don’t get the opportunity to go to a ‘real’ hairdressers very often these day. I’m not complaining when I say I can’t afford it, it’s just a fact. I chose a lifestyle 10 years ago that creates a great wealth of happiness, offers me bucket loads of valuable family time, but very little cash flow and no financial wealth. And I’m happy with that.\nHowever it tends to mean I don’t buy new makeup, go to the hairdressers very often, or shop for new clothes. In fact I’m sat here in a sweater I bought in the Lake District whilst dating a lad call Ian when I was 18!!! I’m 46 now – yipes. (Mind you its the only thing from my skinny , sexy teens that still fits – even my feet are bigger these days! lol). Needless to say I don’t often look in a mirror either. Sometimes I go to brush my teeth at night and realise I haven’t even looked at my hair never mind run my hands or a brush through it all day. Incidentally I don’t own a brush. I used to own long pronged comb but I threw that out some years ago. I do have anti frizz sprays. Much needed but they tend to last a lonnngggg time!\nAnyway – who cares? When I lived in the ‘normal’ world and worked in a ‘normal’ job, i would put on full makeup every morning and tidy my hair. John and I are happy. My friends here don’t judge me. I get no more ‘funny looks’ than when I make an effort (?!). I don’t think there is a single person outside of my Welsh friends who has seen me without makeup or stilettos. I didn’t feel complete without either and both were integral parts of my past life.\nThese days I occasionally miss that ‘dressing up’ but I can do it if I want. So sometimes I put on the slap, coiffure my hair and go to Tescos , however, some days I sling on my jog bottoms , pull on a sweatshirt and do the same without considering a mirror. Sometimes I wonder if its laziness or depression.\nMaybe sometimes it is. But mainly I think it’s because I’m more comfortable in\nmy own skin and with my own personality and friends then I used to be. I guess the hair and makeup of my old life often made me feel stronger, more confident, able to face the day. Sometimes though, as these days with the opposite it was to hide feeling low or it was a chore.\nIt signified a lack of confidence. Funny isn’t it. I’m all for either option and everyone should go for it as they see fit. So these days I do a bit of both, as my fancy takes me.\nSome days I dress like this. other times like that.\nAnyway, I digress.\nYesterday I took John to Steil in Llandeilo. My hairdressing salon of choice should I have the time and money.. He was desperate, he had no idea how to handle his aging hair (sorry john) so he ignored it.\nHe did so in the spirit of freedom, rebellion and denial! Anyway Craig was horrified with his shoulder length wavy locks\nand after some fiddling, negotiating, an hour of preening and a little bit of ‘product’ he came away looking younger and very handsome and pretty damned trendy (so he’d been told). Anyway, as Jason (our son) said, when he heard I’d booked his dad in, “At least you won’t look like a twat anymore!”\nSo, as I was saying at the beginning, I don’t get to a proper hairdresser very often these day and rely on either avoiding mirrors or packet colour to keep me optimistic! However, I am looking more and more like an angora goat these days, without the cuteness or the benefit of getting a nice wooly jumper in a month or two. Whilst I have recently had a close encounter with a packet of “Live Colour XXL” and gone deep red, it flops in a shaggy heap and frizzes like I’ve had my finger in an electric socket. I liken myself to Crystal Tips (you may remember Crystal Tips and Alistair from your childhood if you are around my age).\nOver the years I’ve been here I’ve been various shades of red/pink/purple but rarely braved more than a trim. However. I had a consultation with Craig before I left and booked myself a “4 appointment slot” for 5th March (That’s at least four hours of preening) . Craig wants to be “dramatic”, “make a statement” and be bold. with my hair. “It’s all about design darling” . So this is the plan (and remember John was with me agreeing these decisions). *sharp intake of breath* navy, with highlights in bright orange, wedged back, with a splash of turquoise.!!!!! Well I’m getting on in age , it’s now or never and never leads to regret . So…… watch this space……\nSome of the worst mistakes in my life were haircuts. No one liked it, apart from blind people, and I’m sure even they sensed its profound ugliness as it passes by. 🙂\nLikeLike\nhahahaha x thanks for taking time out to read and comment.- much appreciated\nLikeLike",

Thanks to social media life is pretty much as it was when he lived here. We communicate as if he were in the house…that is , by text!.\nThe main differences are his room is clean and there are no dirty boxer shorts on my bathroom floor!\nIt’s not that I don’t miss him. I do . It’s more of a feeling that he’s very much still here. After all, as they get older they tend to start preparing you for their flight from home by staying at mates/girlfriends house or going on holiday without you. So I’m used to him not being in the house. And I’m used to communicating with him over Facebook.\nHe however is less used to living on his own. His absences from here generally coincided with him being in a home with another dad/mum…. cook!\nHe’s missing some mum-made grub. That means I’ll probably get a home visit soon and so shall start batch cooking shortly so I can load him up with goodies to take back.\nI’m glad he’s missing me. we mum’s like to know that!\nAwwww it’s good to know they still need us – even when they’re away at uni.

However….. hold on for the serious bit…\nIn the May 2015 General Election I voted for a coalition… I don’t mean I had a special box on my ballot paper, I mean I voted in a way I hoped would ensure that neither Milliband nor Cameron had unfetted control over the country. Or rather, that was the plan. As it happened I needn’t have worried about a Labour Government…Ed and his spin team ensured his unnatural stance in front of any camera removed any credibility he had regarding his ability to manager the UK. However I still find it hard to believe we have an ALL-Conservative Government. Cameron and his toffee-nosed, out of touch cronies who wouldn’t understand the troubles of the hardworking woman or man if they were explained it in words of single syllables; unfettered governing; hurtling through legislation in a destructive whirlwind having secured less than 36.9% of the total vote.\nIf you consider the second most popular stance was 33.9% disengaged ie DID NOT VOTE, it does not bode well.\nActually, being a bit of a statistics obsessed saddo I worked out that if you take the Conservative vote as a percentage of the total voting population only 16.1% of the population voted for a Conservative Government (I could bore you with the maths… let me know if you need my workings, its been a long time since I did my O Levels)\nI’ve tried voting for sanity and moderation; I’ve tried keeping a liberal mind and hoping the governance retained some balance. No more my friends… from now on I stand for Insanity, it’s the only thing that makes sense.\nTHIS GOVERNMENT …\nDOES NOT MAKE SENSE\nWe are governed by a group of people voted in by just 16% of the voting aged population!!!! EEK.\nTHIS POLITICAL SYSTEM….\nDOES NOT MAKE SENSE\nEven without a fairer proportional representation system they only have 331 of the 650 seats and get to make ALL the decisions\nTHIS FLAGRANT DISREGARD AND PUNISHMENT, THIS LACK OF RESPECT: FOR THE POOR; THE WORKING CLASS; THE YOUNG; THE LOW PAID; THE GRAFTERS; THE DISABLED; THE SELF EMPLOYED ….\nDOES\nNOT\nMAKE\nSENSE\nSo for me, I, Bernice Benton, AKA Lady Lily the Pink, will not only Vote for insanity, I shall Stand for Insanity.

I have a BIG birthday coming up and a big party planned for it. I am not the slightest bit worried about reaching the end of my 50th year on this planet. I’m also massively excited like a kid waiting for Santa, at the prospects of the party night. I’ll be surrounded by the most wo derful people I have the honour and joy of knowing and am lucky enough to have as friends. It’s overwhelming how many wonderful people I know and love, most surprisingly how many love me back. And they will (mostly) all be here from all over the country to share this moment in time with me in a few days. I’m fit to burst.\nHOWEVER…..\nHOW THE HELL DO WOMEN COPE ON DON’T TELL THE BRIDE?!?!\nI have left Hubby in charge of the details ie invites, music, venue ,stage; decor ,cake (?)… omg i’ve just realised i’m writing this blog as a subtle (?!?!!!!!) checklist for his good self…. I am truly a control freak!\nNO. MY FREAKY OUT NESS is about the catering. The one not so small aspect I have taken control of… but without the involvement in the before, after and logistics. So have woken in a cold sweat.\n1, I don’t think I’ve catered for enough people. I had planned to cook weekly and freeze ready to finish off on the day but I think there will be far more people at the venue than i’ve prepared food for\n2: it’s a hot buffet. I asked Hubby to check it could happen at the venue. It can BUT The venue want me to wait until their restaurant closes. How and when will I heat all the food and set it out? How can I relax and enjoy the party if we can’t use the kitchen until 9pm. It just won’t work\n3. So how much should I interfere in the planning to sort this out or should I assume Hubby has a ‘kitchen team’ who will step up and action everything when the time comes?\n3: I mean . There is food in various locations around the village… freezer space on loan. This food needs to rash the same cation be defrosted but some needs to be chilled,some heated and all laid out. How? By whom? I mean. It’s my birthday I plan to be pissed by 9pm not having spent 3 hours in a kitchen\n4: and which kitchen if I can’t use the venue one until 9pm. This plan just won’t work\n5: what i’m saying is (without wishing to interfere in Hubby’smaster plan) is that the food needs to be MUCH earlier otherwise I can’t partake in the party…\nOver to you Hubster. …\nBy 9pm you just won’t care!

The idea of throwing something away because it’s old or for newer technology does not sit well with us. And if something breaks our first thought is to fix it not replace it. It’s saves loads of money (of which we have little) and its far more eco-friendly to fix something then scrap it and replace it with a new one. That’s why our (touch wood) washing machine is over 20 years old and working just fine (Ok we’ve replaced parts a couple of times); and why we still have a cathode ray tube TV (that my dad was chucking out 15 years ago because the colour definition had gone – but we fixed for £30); and why John just had to have a go at this…\nWe bought a Toyota Prius from our wonderful local Toyota dealership in Builth 10/11 years ago. Second hand 2005 model. Despite its dents and scrapes its been fine. The garage service and MOT it annually and fix any niggles and problems. they’re a fantastic team and should we ever need a new second-hand car we will get another Toyota because of their customer service.\nA few weeks after the last service which includes a battery health check we went away for a few days in our Imps. On return john went somewhere in the Toyota and by the time he returned every warning light was on ; glowing red cars with exclamation marks VSC and break warnings… it did not look good.\nPopped to the garage and were told it would be one of two things a faulty start-up which made the computers think the hybrid battery was failing; or the hybrid battery was failing. They reset the warnings and said if they don’t come back on then all is well. sadly they all came back on.\nNow I know nothing about electrics/electronics/engineering or cars but the hybrid battery, I’m told is made up of a series of cells that together make up 220V and although the car is petrol and electric, once the hybrid battery fails the car dies, it will not continue to work on just petrol.\nA new hybrid batter fitted by a dealer is £1200 (that’s one and a half hours of labour (£125) and the battery. The car is maybe worth scrap value without a working battery.\nWe don’t have £1200 or access to it in any way.\nJohn researched refurbished batteries and they were around £300-400 but were in places like Cambridge and Coventry. Plus our wonderful garage agreed they would fit it for us at the same rate but would not be able to offer a guarantee. all fair enough, but one big problem,,,, We didn’t have a car to go and get one.\nAfter much research and YouTube video watching our very own handyman, my John, decided he would give it a go himself. He purchased two new cells at £56 delivered and allowed himself 2 days to dismantle the car and attempt the repair. (Two cells with the thought being that the car might have managed with one failing but two it would be unlikely coupled with the garage previously assuring us that in most cases the cars are scrapped well before the hybrid batteries fail – they’d only ever had two fail in all the years…now three)\nSo, how did John get on? Well here’s his Vlog about it. Basically £56 and four hours and we have a working car again!

I’m not belittling fund raising, its vital and a great thing to do. What I’m saying is its a great thing to do for lots of reasons other than the actual cash result. Perhaps this is something that we are programmed to not admit as charitable fundraising is seen as an altruistic and selfless activity.\nHowever, if I dare suggest that fundraising is also a good thing for the benefits the fundraiser gets. Its a boost to ones self-esteem, a pat on the shoulder of one’s conscience, an opportunity to make your views and passions public and express a side of your personality. I suggest that there is nothing wrong with accepting that fundraising is a mutually beneficial activity.\nI’d also suggest that the raising of awareness; the engaging of like-minded people, the pro-activity, the community engagement are also important benefits of doing something for a good cause.\nIn fact quite often its the little charitable acts that are more effective in achieving all of the above than big actions for registered charities. After all, registered charities cost a lot to run , so large proportions of monies raised go into paying staff, websites, literature, mail drops etc etc. Obviously I’m not advocating we stop giving to the large charities but what I want to do is ‘big’ up the little acts because you don’t need to splash the cash to be able to help a good cause. Which is handy in these times of austerity.\nIt takes nothing, for example to check in on the old lady or gentleman living on their own down the road. even sharing a FB status advertising a fundraising event or gig is helpful.\nA couple of weeks ago my son and various friends of his and their joint musical talents and bands performed officially and then unofficially amongst other local musicians in the pubs around Brecon as part ofOxjam. They ended up jamming until 4am. It was an awesome day.\nMore importantly is the realisation that the benefit is mutual. money, I’m pleased to say was raised for a very good cause – in a non-pressure way – there were collection buckets on the bar- people gave what they could or wanted. the music was FREE. The musicians got exposure, got to perform (their passion), enjoyed the atmosphere, networked, laughed and felt fan-bloody-tastic. The audience, staff, parents, friends got to be entertained, had the opportunity to help/give, laughed, shared, made new friends….\n(Check out this you tube video out – cover of Sympathy for the Devil by young band, The Hurricanes)\nWhen I started writing this blog piece I knew what I wanted to say but not really now to get it out. Then an opportunity presented itself to me and through blogging and face-booking and the general network of social media communication that I find helpful, soulful and satisfying, It was enlightening, almost an epiphany! i chanced upon two things. The first was author and blogger Alana Munro, and a subsequent comment on her blog lead me to Pulp Literature. From there I was lead to the most inspirational TED TALK, “The Art of Asking”. If you only have 13 minutes to spare all day may I humbly suggest you spend it watching this . This talk just about gets to the heart of everything I feel and wanted to say in this blog. Give and take, asking for help, reaching out, touching. Life is bloody marvelous and if you open your mind and heart you let in the best of people and they get the best of you too.\nYou got it! I didn’t experience what it was like to have a real ask/give/take/donate artistic relationship until I started doing this through Pulp Literature. I’m learning to trust others in a new way. It has all been amazing,\nLikeLike\nGlad to help!\nLikeLike",

It looked so perfect displayed together in that beautiful bright white box with loads of natural light shining in.\nIt wasn’t just me who thought so.

There were so many more points of light and smudges in that darkness than I had ever seen before, having previously lived inner city. I would look up, with wonder at the prospect of the infinite new beginnings and endings; the energy that must be existing, living, dying and flowing beyond beyond.\nThen I started looking at images taken from space telescopes and felt a spiritual connection to all that light and energy exploding out of the darkness. These energetic outpourings millions/billions of years ago still shine bright today; still impact on the here and now. For every action, no matter how large or small has an impact. A smile, a frown, a wave, which road we take, which path we walk. Everything makes a difference.\nThey say that something as a small as the flutter of a butterfly wing may ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world…\nAlso, all items are available for sale, if anyone is interested.

When they happen I wonder if they are by luck or by state of mind. Probably a bit of both. I do know for sure that those days I’m in a bad mood, more negative things happen. However, this Friday, just gone…that would be yesterday(!) was highly anticipated as a planned busy but nice day. The resulting day was glorious.\nAs you may know I am mid way through my first ever solo art exhibition. it was quite a long time in the planning and prepping and quite emotional in the setting up and previewing… but it’s there now. It’s actually going well in terms of feedback and I am definitely extremely proud of it.\nA small group of wonderful friends who I know mainly through teaching them stained glass during the wonderful Welsh Legends Window Project, had arranged a jolly to the Radnorshire Museum to see my exhibition and I had arranged to go with them and do our fave thing “Ladies Who Lunch”, first. So as you can tell, it was already going to be a lovely day.\nThese, lovely, colourful, energy filled, inspiring women gathered to join me at The Herb Garden for pre-exhibition food. The Cafe is my very favourite in Llandrindod Wells, a community cafe , serving wholesome, freshly made, delicious delights with top quality organic ingredients. It has friendly staff, cosy sofas, a selection of newspapers and magazines, a pile of toys for any kids, a local information board and a gallery wall. In this instance there was a display of stunning photographs of China by a local photographer/friend of mine, Mike Lewis. A perfect accompaniment to our lunch with it being Chinese New Year. (sadly I didn’t take any photos at it would have meant leaning across strangers who were eating their lunch and I thought that might appear a tad rude! the place was packed)\nAs we trotted round to the museum, it was a gloriously sunny early Spring day, the type of day that fills you with optimism and joy for new beginnings and the arrival of Spring flowers and the hope of Summer not too far away.\nThere was quite a buzz of excitement from my friends climbing the stairs (or using the lift) to reach the exhibition space. I think there were genuinely impressed and enjoyed the exhibition, which really gave me quite a boost. Additionally, because of the location, they had the bonus of discovering this quaint and eclectic collections within the museum itself. So a fabulous afternoon..\n… but there was icing on our daily cake … on arrival we were told that three internationally acclaimed harpists were about to arrive to look at the Welsh triple harp the museum has in its collection and that one of these harpists was going to play it…. we were allowed to sit in on an impromptu harp recital by Robin Huw Bowen (head to discography and click the listen button, its exquisite … ).Robin proceeded to discuss the history of this harp, his interaction with the ancestors of the owner who donated it to the museum in 1952, and played some classic Welsh tunes and some Welsh gypsy popular music of the time\nThose gorgeous looking ladies sat by the harpist are Camille & Kennerly Kitt, otherwise known as The Harp Twins here as part of a world tour, having just finished a 4th gig in Wales. They play rock music on electric harps – something to behold!\nHere’s a little clip from the recital. Robin did apologise, he said if he’d known there would be an audience he would have arrived earlier to tune the harp!!! Still …we were happy !\nCongrats on the solo show, Berni! That is fab! Keep it up! #thesatsesh xo\nLikeLike\n#thesatsesh music is everything….i have harp envy. its such a beautiful sound – looks good too. so glad you had a lovely day…partial to a ladies lunch also 🙂\nLikeLike\nI have just , literally, got home from lunch with some ladies who were school friends #anythinggoes@_karendenbid199@gmail is\nLikeLike\nGood for you.

I was surprised by the vitriolic nature of the argument (on both sides).\nBut now we have a decision – a decision of the people. That is democracy – and I am also surprised that democracy has actually worked and that the government is going to do what the majority want!\nIf you didn’t vote, then I’m afraid you missed the boat. More fool you.\nThe next step is for us all to get on with it! A bit of post-match banter by all means, but the vote has been cast. If anything, the bile and vitriol has got worse… stop it both sides NOW.\nThe trick now is to make the decision work for us, whatever that means. Endless bitching and whining will get us nowhere.\nCan we all just calm down, take a step away from the fight for a second and try looking forward in an optimistic way? The future is more than uncertain – it is unknown… that’s kind of how future is.\nWe are supposed to be a United Kingdom – lets act like one.”\nWise and patient words. Let us reflect and listen.",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_05_12_its-all-about-the-blogvlog-etc/content_906.html": "I love the blogger Rhyming with Wine, her poetic interpretations and observations have me in stitches. Her most recent blog “The Stats Race”, sits perfectly with my views of social media and the knots I tie myself up with in an attempt to achieve my goals. Basically, this blog is where I dump all the shit that pops into my head!. However, I do it in the hope of entertaining, inspiring or provoking a reaction in you lovely lot (my readers…I say in the hope that there really is someone or sometwo out there).\nThree months ago I set myself some challenges for 2017\nI thought it would be helpful to me and hopefully not too boring for you, if I were to check out my own progress and possibly re-evaluate\n- Twitter: my following has just overtopped the 500 mark and I’m delighted, For me its quality rather than quantity so I shall start focusing on interactors more (when I work out exactly how to do that)… but if you are following me on @berni_Benton, then “thanks” and if you are also interacting with me then I think I’m a little bit in love with you because I love a good bit of banter\n- I’m still trying to tidy up my twitter lists – I’ve started some, “fave bloggers”, ” fave artists”, ” fave…” etc… then i need to talk to these groups more – so I can get more out of them – I’d prefer dialog to monologue, and that’s down to me, timing and organisation (neither of which are in my current ‘strengths’ corner)\n- Blog: my following is now 133, from 114, I’m aiming for 150 and my views are up from 13.5K to 15K and there’s still 6 months to go to make my 20K goal\n- Teaching: I have massively enjoyed and proved myself to be pretty darned good at teaching, check out Community Project – progress report to see whats been going on. I wanted another teaching commission out of it and the group I’m teaching are keen to have more sessions so we-hey!!! more teaching is on the cards\n- Vlogging: I’ve started in a very very very small way, to vlog, I’ve not included my face or my voice so far but I have started to include video content into my blogs….I don’t know if you guys like it, perhaps you can let me know.\n- I’ve joined Instagram – that’s an extra, wasn’t on my list at all but I think I can get to grips with that – lovely visual app and quick and easy to use… still working out how to use it properly but early days\n- Facebook: not sure whats happening here , page likes down from 778 to 768… anyone fancy taking a look? It’s where I share stuff going on in and around our home and village, it’s a B&B in Mid Wales, very rural, extremely tranquil, and slightly crazy.. Pink Butterfly Art & Glass at Cerdyn Villa…\n- Art: I’ve already done 3 more pieces of art this year, speculative spacescapes, have booked my FIRST EVER solo exhibition slot for March/April 2018 and have the rest of the pieces sketching out nicely in my head… it’s going to play on light and dark. With black canvasses painting with colours and patterns emulation images from outer space and then representations of space made from stained glass and back-lit by natural light. I have one commission glass panel confirmed and one pending approval (god i hope to get to make it, I always get excited once I’ve done the drawings).\nAll in all I’m pretty pleased with my progress. I think my report card might read ” Is trying hard, achieving many of her goals, still some way to go, but with sustained commitment and the right support and determination there is no reason why Berni can’t make it”\nDo you have a bucket list for your year? Hows it going?\nUm what are twitter lists? I thought I was on track with it all but will have a google. Heading over to fb to check out your B&B.\nLikeLike\ni have a friend who swears by them and she is a social media whizz. you can add people to lists without even following them and then if you want to talk to people on a specific topic if you have set up your lists right you can access the right people – …so i’m told… i have several lists….ooo and also apparently you ccan subscribe to other peoples lists to find followers etc with the relevent interests …. not enough hours in the day or functioning braincells in my head at the moment – but its there on my list….\nthanks also for looking at my FB xxx\nLikeLike\nYou’re right about the functioning brain cells 🙂 Than you, I will start making lists. And just when I thought I had everything under control.\nLikeLike\nOh I love this – And exsqueeze me but you are nailing it Mrs! Vlogs? Teaching? Amazing artwork? You are incredibly talented. Thank you so much for the mention and here’s to dumping of all of the stuff! Big bloggy hug. Sending wine x\nLikeLike\nthank you xxx still finding time for wine too\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

The Official Monster Raving Loony Party are gathering in Blackpool this coming weekend to debate their new policies, vote in their new cabinet and generally resolve those issues that worry their voters… Actually, the only guarantee is that practically NO politics will be discussed at all.\nThere will , of course be some discussion relating to the credibility of politics following #piggate; there will definitely be a cabinet reshuffle and quite a lot of meeting and greeting of the public. There will also be quite a bit of filming for the party political broadcast for the pending Welsh Assembly Elections in May 2016.\nOtherwise the time will be spent, drinking, dressing up and dancing. True to the Lady Lily the Pink motto… “let’s drink a drink…” , the Mid Wales Loony Bus will be heading to the events hosts, The New Guilderoy Hotel and Uncle Toms Cabin post-haste on Friday afternoon ready for some meet and greet over some Co-Ale-ition Ales and a venue-load of great Loony bands including Mr Badaxe, The Fibbers and (headlining), Vince Ripper and The Rodents Show.

There are so many paths to explore, why fix the route?\nI liken it to following a map and road signs rather than SATNAV. SATNAV takes you from A to B on the quickest or easiest route. You remain completely oblivious to the places and sights you might only be moments away from. You just focus on the end goal. The final destination. You don’t even read the road signs as you pass them (especially those lovely brown touristy ones and those white ones with weird sounding names of teeny villages and hamlets)\nFollowing the route on a map you might notice points C,E, D…X, Y, Z; just off in the distance that you could easily detour too. You can see that there is another, slightly more wiggly path that might be an interesting alternative to part of your journey and you can just nip off in that direction for a bit and take in the sights.\nI always read the map.\nI can be heading along the road of life and I get to a junction. SATNAV would have me go straight on, but over there to the left of me there’s this really cool looking thing going on, so I whip off along that new route. Once I’m there I could still head back the way I came, and I might, but from this new position there’s another junction and there are loads of circular routes to explore and even a couple of longer roads and corners to venture down where who knows what might be at the end. Exciting isn’t it? Ok so it might be a dead end. I may have to double back a bit. But what have I really lost? I haven’t really lost any time, I’ve used that time to try something or see something and concluded its not for me. I’ve had an experience. Hopefully I’ve learned something from that experience…. time will tell.\nI still have a destination to reach. My destination is happiness and fulfillment. See my children grow with open hearts and minds of their own. Embrace my grandchildren. Give back to the planet. Love and be loved. Fit in as much happiness for me and those around me as I can before I die.\nAll our lives are a journey from A to Z . None of us get out of it alive. So why not explore a little? We don’t need to take the most direct route.\n#thesatsesh lol nearly just typed #thesatnav…new linky anyone lol.\nSo im not a map reader – Im a sat nav chic with a twist, in the car we have one and its fabulously reliable. I have one my ex bought me when they first came out (from a bloke in a pub)….anyway, it ALWAYS lets me down and i bloody love it, the joy that mr nav and the stories / memories are hilarious.\nSo, I don’t think it matters which you pick as long as you enjoy the journey.\nLikeLike\nquite right, good for you… as long as the journey is part of the adventure xxx\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nSo true, never thought about it that way before, but I will now! #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nYou are so Right! My Hubbie and I were talking about this the other day actually; how our lives have taken many twists and turns along this road of life. It’s ok but my advice; look up and enjoy the journey too. #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nI hope I’ve persuaded you in my own little way …some of the side roads are really interesting x\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nLOVE this post on the journey.

The question is, at the end of February, am I still focused? Have I learnt anything? Done anything with that knowledge and interacted with the right people and platforms to achieve my goals?\nWell just in case you can’t be arsed to read any more, the short answer is YES!!! And in the hope of enticing you to stick with it, here are some visuals to demonstrate some of this years successes so far…\nYes, I’ve been really proactive with my stained glass, making batches of glass hens, blue tits, daffodils, easter eggs and a couple of dragons…. OK, I haven’t finished the dragons but they’re cut and ready for the next phase. Here’s one I made earlier…\nYes, I am officially offering AND DELIVERING stained glass teaching from my little home studio. I’ve discovered it’s ideal for teaching on a one to one basis or up to 3 people at a time so it makes a great Mother and Daughter gift (thinking Mothers Day here people 😉 ); best friends break; or couples activity. This mum and daughter had a fabulous time. Get in touch if you want to book one – I may be offering deals and discounts to friends/ bloggers xx\nYes, having hoped to do a bit of demoing /public speaking this year I happily have have two demos/talks to do for a couple of WI groups – first one is in 10 days time I shall be making daffodils out of glass before their very eyes! Magic!\nAnd yes, things are looking up on social media. My followings are improving. More importantly the interaction is going up… no point in having likers and followers if they never chat to you is there… I’m making some lovely friends through it and who knows where it will lead. This year so far I have 78 more twitter followers, 26 more blog followers; both around 15% increases but blog views per month have doubled since 2017 (based on monthly averages )…\nMy finally piece of positive news is the guest spot coming up on Deborah’s My Random Musings , Bloggers Corner Interview … goes live on 25th… so excited. I love Deborahs’ blog and how she supports other bloggers and writers.\nHowever I have been struggling….\nOn the learning front….\n…I tried and tried and tried to get my head around my existing blog/websites for my B&B and decided I was just not techy enough. I read loads of stuff about blogging and twitter and wordpress and tied myself in a knot of frustration and felt like I was drowning in all the information and my failure to process it. In the end I put a shout out for help and am delighted to say that I had several offers of support. Thanks to those who offered help and advice. Particularly…..\nKaty McKenzie of Something Different is studying Film Production at Derby Uni and has her own successful Youtube channel. She has offered to help me create a media pack… just chatting to her and tapping in to her enthusiasm was refreshing, it calmed me out of my panic straight away… who says the young can’t teach us oldies a few things! I look forward to her technical insight .\nHolistic health blogger and freelance digital marketer, Petra Kravos of Be Healthy Now, has taken me up on the offer of a skills swap… she’s going to help me with my tech and in return I will treat her to a weekend break with her partner here at our B&B…. can’t wait to meet her in person and to learn some new tricks. I just hope I can impress her with my homemade veggie and vegan breakfast options 😉 … I know she’ll love the fresh air and landscape and the wonderful cycling routes just on our doorstep.\nI’m now very excited about the prospects of learning and developing my sites over the next month or so….\nAnd just a quicky roundup of how I’m doing on my health and wellbeing goals…\nI’ve lost a stone in weight, god knows where from as I still feel like I’m bursting out of bras and trousers in every direction but those scales don’t lie. I’m eating more healthily; have cut out all junk snack; feel more energised; am drinking loads more water; have not had any much alcohol (mums birthday and valentines); and I’ve walked into the village everyday occasionally instead of taking the car; basically its all heading in the right direction.\nHowever….\n… have failed on the weekly date days with Hubby (although we do snuggle together on the sofa every evening); And I’ve barely made it to a dance/exercise class nor have I just danced for fun, although I have been practicing my belly rolls …I’ll never get to this but I can remain inspired… an old woman girl can dream of being this fit can’t she\nSo how is your year going? Did you set targets? Have they fallen by the wayside? Perhaps there have been some surprises that have moved you in other directions? Would love to hear from you.\nLove the stained glass work! So cool!! Especially the daffodils!! X\nLikeLike\nBack from #thesatsesh with some blogger encouragement! xoxo\nLikeLike\nIt’s only March, and you are KICKING it! Go Girl! #dreamteam xoxo\nLikeLike\nWhat an amazing year you have had so far, here is to many more successes X #anythinggoes\nLikeLike\nReading this it makes me think I ought to have another look at my resolutions post for this year. It sounds like you’ve had a lot of positives and have faced up to your struggles and brought in people to help. Keep going #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nto be fair, I am unusually focused this year 😉 xx\nLikeLike\nSo nice to get an update on how things are going – that’s great that the blog views have doubled recently and your stained glass work looks fantastic. The lessons sound fab – if only I lived a little nearer. Well done also for losing that stone! That’s amazing in winter – all I seem to do is eat at this time of year! Good luck with the techy stuff – the skills swap sounds like a great idea. #thesatsesh xx\nLikeLike\nThank you. We do run a B&B and I’m starting to run weekend retreats for stained glass or you can have a holiday here and just do a day course… don’t dismiss the idea, it would be fun! Thanks for reading and commenting xx\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nSounds lovely! I won’t dismiss it – thank you xx\nLikeLike\nWow Bernice, you really are steaming ahead on the goal front! I love the idea of a mum / daughter stained glass session. I wish we lived nearer to you! This is something that I would love to learn to do myself. It’s brilliant that you have been able to get some help with the techie side of your blog… that’s always the trickiest bit. Thanks for sharing with the #DreamTeam xx\nLikeLike\nAnnette, do it!!! you can stay in the B&B and have a day course or a weekend workshop . You should think about it. It would be a treat and you’d have loads of fun. The sessions are private so if you booked a mum and daughter session it would just be the two of you and me. xx\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nWell done on a fantastic year so far Thank you for linking to #Thatfridaylinky please come back next week\nLikeLike\nIt sounds like youre making so brilliant progress in every aspect of your life, congrats lovely! #thatfridaylinky\nLikeLike\ncheers lovely, I am finding myself unusually focussed this year so far!\nLikeLike\nThank you for the mention! Im so happy to help another blogger out no matter what is it!x\nLikeLike\nthanks for your help x\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nMy goodness missus. What a year you’re having and it’s only March. Well done.

Which is difficult when you live life without one. Actually it’s not difficult at all because you can claim that the outcome was the plan and hey presto ‘success!’ I swear by it. It makes for a very satisfying lifestyle and it doesn’t half make you feel good.\nAnyway, I digress. Todays furry tale is about me and Ffloyd. If you know me, you know Ffloyd . And if you know Ffloyd you know that she has matured nicely, having received her magenta facelift 3 years ago. From her youthful baby doll pink to her current most stunning livery in the expert hands of Dr Crompton (Junior), that would be classic car restorer and oh-so-talented-middle-son, Graham.\nSometimes though we may look fit on the outside but we are not really looking after our internals very well. Poor Ffloyd. Now 48 and having had a new roofliner 14 years ago by bodge-artist-Berni (yes, that would be me) , really needed a new head. The problem with a compound curve is that to re\ncover it is, to use a technical term, ‘bloody difficult’ . In a rush job to sort it before the National last year I figured it would work with tablecloth vinyl and acquired some gorgeous length of floweriness, removed the cream fleece but left the battered old original and made a failed attempt at gluing said floral display onto said ripped old original. To a blind man, from a distance , it looked passable. Just. To me, not so much. It was embarrassing.\nMuch thought went into plan B. So I acquire a long, wide length of pink fur. Completely removed the original battered liner, took off the roof struts, did a fair bit of measuring, re-measuring, pinning, re-pinning and then bit the bullet.\nI sought out a genius..ie a good friend with a sewing machine and the wherewithal to use it. Charmed said friend with the promise of coffee, cwtches and banter , and took the new roof to a central location with a plug socket and a coffee machine, for the stitching to occur (no photos of this phase 😦 ) . I can tell you it involved a lot of caffeine, much laugher, an audience and a 91-year-old ‘fan’ with a walking stick!! Thanks to all involved in ‘Operation Pink Fluff’.\n“All that was left”, eeekk, was to fit it…….\nI think John and I will be coughing up pink fur balls for some time……..\nIn the meantime, who’s for a spin in Ffloyd? Time for a new adventure\nFurry pink fabulousness!! Love it and look forward to a journey to enjoy close up soon xx\nLikeLike\nYou had better be careful,the damned EU might deem it a fire hazzard!

I’m rewarding myself by writing this blog in the bath.\nI haven’t babbled from my bathtub for a while. Remember the bolognaise incident? Well that rendered me pretty much unable to soak for about four weeks. I am pleased to report that I am almost completely healed.\nI’ve brought my (extremely large) Bailey’s once with me. I’ve lit candles, including a couple of gorgeous Yankee Candles I received for my birthday, and I am wallowing in smug self-satisfaction.\nI’m so ahead of myself I even made tonight’s supper yesterday because I forgot we were out at a pre-Christmas dinner party… Ok so I’m not totally in control of everything!…. But at least we didn’t eat it and then remember we were going out!\nSo ready or not, I shall happy soak here in the possibly ignorant belief that I have this year’s festivities under control…\n…just hoping the doorbell doesn’t ring and I end up realising I’ve arranged a pre festivities soiree chez nous for tonight….\nMerry Christmas you lovely lot in Blogland. May your Christmas be joyous, relaxing and full of love . I may see you again before 2018 but who knows with my random ramblings 😘\nOoh you are organised!! As you’ve probably realised from how late this comment is, I’m not organised at all, ha!! Hope you had a fantastic Christmas, thank you for linking this to #DreamTeam!\nLikeLike\nIt’s so good when you finally get done isn’t it! Merry Christmas #DreamTeam\nLikeLike",

I decided to do this over 2 years ago, I can’t believe that this coming weekend is THE weekend.\nHaving first discussed the idea in May 2013, I somehow managed to engage 2 amazing ladies (June Duncan and Jenny Walsby) who decided to grow their hair for a year with the view to cutting it off for donation this May just gone. The idea .. to raise money and increase our fund pot for this amazing cause… they were joined by another local lady AureliaTyczka and all 3 donated hair and then had their head shaves – contributing over £750 to the pot. WOW\nThis was the start of our fundraiser that ends this Sunday after Ffloyd and I (and our ‘Tame Mechanic”, John ) have completed the 2014 Pink Car Rally.\nHere’s a reminder of the timetable:\nDay 1 – Saturday 6th September\n9am – meet at Sainsbury’s, Uxbridge Road, Langley, Slough SL1 1SU (Selena Mullen is liaising with them, in the hope that we can make our visit there ‘official’, but if they say ‘no’ then we will simply be a group of very pink customers, in an assortment of pink cars! I, for one, will be having breakfast there around 8am!!! – Thank you, Selena)\n10am – leave Sainsbury’s :-\nOption 1 – if Wexham Park Hospital (SL2 4HL) gives permission, we will drive there first, before heading for the M25. It’s 5 miles from Sainsbury’s.\nOption 2 – head straight for the M25 (directions will be issued)\n12noon – arrive South Mimms Service Area on M25\n1pm – leave South Mimms\n3pm – arrive intu Lakeside – RM20 2ZP http://intu.co.uk/lakeside\nNB We have permission to do an ‘all day’ coin collection here! So anyone choosing to join us here is welcome to start collecting if they arrive before us!\n7pm – leave intu Lakeside and cross the Dartford Bridge (toll) to the Dartford Travelodge (5 miles away)\nPinkie Dinner!!!!!\nDay 2\n9.30am Leave Dartford Travelodge, heading for Brands Hatch DA3 8NG (10.6miles)\n10am Arrive Brand’s Hatch (we should be able to buy food there… I’m currently checking our location and where the food is etc…)\n11am Leave Brand’s Hatch – official start of Day 2 of the rally! Head for M25 S towards Gatwick\nSubject to permission….. (currently waiting to hear) we will then go Sutton, Surrey\n12.15pm Arrive Royal Marsden Hospital Sutton SM2 5PT\nNB If no permission is granted (I’m currently liaising with two hospitals on the site!) then I will find an alternative comfort stop.\n1.30pm Leave the Hospital/other venue… and re-join the M25\n3.30pm Arrive either at Wexham Park Hospital SL2 4HL (awaiting authorisation) or Sainsbury’s Uxbridge Road, Langley, Slough SL1 1SU\nThe rally will end at approx. 4.30pm\nIf you are on the M25 or new any of the scheduled stops PLEASE come along and support us and the host of other PINKIES on the Rally. If you want to show your support and can spare a few pennies please visit my justgiving page and help make this a record year. Last year all the Pinkies together raised almost £18,000. Lets beat it this year.\nI think Ffloyd (aged 46) is going to be the oldest car on the Rally with Jane Sutton, driving Bubble (aged 43) a close second. Her mechanic is coming along too…. should be a fantastic weekend ❤ ❤ ❤",

However, I am not standing, nor are any of my party (The Official Monster Raving Loonies – that is, just in case you’ve been on a different planet and missed me mentioning it), standing for a constituency seat.\nI get the opportunity, as do you all, to have TWO votes on 5th May. One for a Constituency Representative and one for one of the 4 Regional Representatives.\nSo, I’ll be voting Kirsty Williams, for Brecknochshire and Radnorshire, and I shall tell you why.\nThe woman is everywhere. I don’t even know if the cloning technology or teleportation technology she must use is even an allowable expense under the Election Campaigning list of claimable expenses. The fact that she can get to six seperate locations across the great expanse of Powys on every single day of every week, is not only astounding but a testament to her commitment to be accessible to all her constituents.\nAnd, as far as I have witnessed, she clocks up the miles, the energy and the passion for her constituency (Brecknockshire and Radnorshire) whether there is a pending election or not. Certainly whenever anything has been going on in Llanwrtyd Wells (known for being both tiny and in the middle of nowhere), either she or Roger Williams (pre-retirement) would/will attend, rally round, speak out or help us celebrate… even on those occasions when there were no press around to cover the event.\nI’ve never written and not had a reply; I’ve never asked a question of Westminster or WAG and not had it referred on for response, and I’ve never seen her anything other than enthusiastic and interested/concerned depending on the issue.\nIf I wasn’t standing for a Regional seat , I’d even be out canvassing with her. What would we do without her. It’s not like we get any representation from her counterparts (well maybe occasionally if there’s a photo opportunity in it for them).\nAnyway, however you plan to vote, or if you were thinking of not voting. I urge you, go to the polls on 5th May. You have from 7am until 10pm to do so. If you’ve received a postal vote pack, then post it back….But if you miss the deadline you can take it to your local polling station.\nWhatever you do on May 5th, find time to register your TWO votes for the Welsh Assembly….\nIf you Don’t Usually Vote, Then Vote Unusually",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2015_07_30_save-our-rural-bank/content_963.html": "Dear Kirsty Williams\nFurther to you sharing the letter from Lisa Kennedy, Barclays Head of Corporate Relations Central Corporate Affairs Retail and Business Banking; I would like to personally address the questions she raised. I am sure other members of the Llanwrtyd Wells and outer village community have their own responses and further thoughts on the matter. Below is my response to Ms Kennedy. Please forward it for her consideration.\nDear Lisa Kennedy\nYou have asked the following questions and I appreciate you taking the time to review the impact of Barclays’ decision to close the rural branch in Llanwrtyd.\n• What do you believe will be the biggest impact of the closure of the Llanwrtyd Wells branch on the local community?\n• What do you believe will be the biggest impact of the closure of the Llanwrtyd Wells branch on customers of the branch?\n• What alternative ways to bank do you believe need to be provided to help customers and the community adapt to this change?\nImpact on the Community\nLlanwrtyd Wells is a community of around 700 whose prosperity is largely dependent on tourism; particularly event –led tourism which in turn attracts a huge amount of media coverage, sustaining and growing further the reputation and growth of visitor numbers to the town.\nThis tourism is generated from the community working together as a united group of volunteers working tirelessly to sustain the reputation and smooth running / promotion of these events. In case you have been on another planet (!) these events include Man v Horse (35 years) World Bog Snorkelling (33 years) and more latterly, the World Alternative Games with the backing of the Welsh Assembly.\nThe businesses in the town could not survive without these visitors. I’m not just talking about accommodation providers; also the garage the few shops and the pubs/cafes would not sustain themselves without tourist numbers. Without the tourists these facilities would eventually close.\nMany of these businesses trade using cash. Small transactions which do not justify card machines, electronic payments etc. These will be numerous over a short period and both the tourists and the businesses need to access cash and bank to survive. Many transactions would be lost if tourists did not have access to a cash machine\nThe community as you are aware is demographically challenged. Our nearest alternative banks are 12 miles away (a round trip would cost £5 in petrol and an hour in time). Business owners working 6/7 days per week and working to small margins can ill afford this additional cost to time or pocket\nImpact on Customers\nWhilst I accept that numbers accessing bank staff is in decline, it is not appropriate to further marginalise those who continue to require these services. These tend to be the less mobile and the elderly. In any other situation the disadvantaged and vulnerable are invested in to ensure they receive the protection they need, it is only the banking sector who seem to think this section of society should be penalised for not changing. This long serving and vulnerable group NEED access to the facilities to access their money, remain mobile within their accessible area and retain the business and social interaction local banking provides. Big businesses such as Barclay who year on year make large profits have a responsibility to respect their loyal, long term customers and support more vulnerable people\n(NB the bank showed a 43% rise in profits in its half yearly figures (source http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com 29th July)\nThe community residents include farmers and elderly long term residents who do not wish to and should not need to isolate themselves further by switching to electronic forms of banking. Many people value beyond monetary measures interaction with the bank staff, shop staff etc as part of their social well-being.\nMany members of our community are non-drivers, re-homed here from elsewhere through social services or electing to live here because it has the minimum basic facilities one needs with limited mobility. Remember there is very limited public transport solutions.\nI (for example) chose Llanwrtyd because it had a school, library, doctors, pub, shop and BANK. Without this basic set of services younger, growing families would be less likely to base themselves here, resulting in an ageing, declining community.\nWhat Alternatives?\nYes many young people are moving away from banks. However there is still the under 18 economy who babysit, garden, dog walk, wash up, waitress etc. for small amounts of cash. Have you considered they do not use banks because the Welsh Bac does not include basic finance management within its curriculum? How many teenagers/young adults do not know how to manage money and don’t understand APRs etc. The Bank could engage with future customers by interacting with the education system\nThe town at a minimum would require a cash machine. I cannot tell you how many time in my working life here I would have lost business had customers not been able to withdraw cash.\nBanking solutions that do not incur further costs to businesses. Most of the activities in this community are not for profit, charity or community driven. These groups cannot afford to take on the costs of card machines, transaction fees etc.\nMany of the small businesses cannot afford card machine fees as their margins are tiny. Transaction fees would increase prices and potentially reduce sales, resulting in business decline or closure.\nInternet access and Superfast Cymru are a joke in this community. AS is mobile phone signal. Since BT put in the fibres there are still a large proportion of individuals and businesses who are ‘too far from the cabinet’ and also in the installation the old ADSL solution has been damaged. Personally, as a B&B owner, there are huge chunks of time where internet access is impossible from our location, making electronic banking unviable\nTo conclude\nI would implore Barclays to be the Peoples Bank it always used to be, to support rural, marginalised, elderly and vulnerable customers, engage the next generation and support communities working hard to sustain their economies by maintaining local banking. Be better than the rest. One of you has to lead the way. Why not let it be you?\nBernice Benton\nSmall Business Owner\nActive Member of community led tourism initiatives\nPassionate resident out to protect her community",

Its position, nestling in the Irfon Valley, offers a diverse landscape expanding out in every direction; forestry, mountain ranges, glacial valley, waterfalls, winding roads, bridle paths.\nIt is the perfect base for touring the whole of Wales. It’s the perfect base for exploring and discovering hidden gems. It’s the perfect base to find yourself at one and alone with nature; to find peace and tranquillity; flora and fauna; wildlife and bird life.\nIt was from Llanwrtyd that mountain biking and long distance walking began in the UK.\nThese activities continue today with tourists coming here to explore our stunning and challenging landscape. It also continues here alongside our penchant for the eccentric, with Llanwrtyd Wells being the birthplace of quirky events such as The Real Ale Wobble; Man versus Horse (originally also verses bike); Bog Snorkelling and, more recently, Mountain Bike Chariot Racing and the bi-annual World Alternative Games.\nAs a town, we are recognised as the smallest in the UK, with little over 700 residents, we are smaller than most villages! Our heart is huge. Accommodation providers offer amazing value and exceptional service relying heavily on recommendation and repeat business (a great plus for the traveller that we are not on the tourist trail).\nDespite our size we have 3 pubs and 4 award-winning restaurants. Foodies indeed, offering quarterly farmers markets with locally produced, grown and prepared delicacies; and an annual Food Fair to tickle your taste buds. There’s even a cookery school if that’s your passion.\nThe inspirational landscape, with its wild ponies, sheep, red kites and diverse bird life draws artists and artisans to its heart. It’s a great location to visit amazing artists; discover hidden artisans and off the beaten track art havens.\nWhatever your reason for travel, there is something for you a spectacular landscape away. But if you want to park the car and explore on foot, bike or train we have enough at hand to keep you entertained.\nTo find out more about us and where we live www.cerdynvilla.wales\nyou really should – lol x\nLikeLike\nJust read your blog about the town and surrounding areas- the photos are beautiful……and it sounds a really appealing place.I must visit some day!\nLikeLike",

I’m fairly ‘alternative’ and, am told, slightly ‘eccentric’. I wear many hats. Not all suit me…\nLife gets confusing and chaotic……\nHere’s perhaps why….\nI’m an artist, I occasionally do pet portraits, I often do stained glass commissions. I do have an Etsy shop, which I manage in a very ad hoc way. I promise to keep a stock of my designs but the artistic bit of me is really only interested in the bespoke commissions and one-off designs , so I struggle to find time to hold stock. So I make my designs to order.\nI teach stained glass. It’s a new string to my bow. I love it. I find it immensely satisfying and it brings me huge amount of joy.\nI run a B&B. This involves being really nice to (mostly) lovely people, talking (a lot), keeping the place clean, ironing sheets (even though I’d never iron my own) and cooking really gorgeous breakfasts. I do this with my hubby. We love working together. It works. Coming to stay at Cerdyn Villa is like staying with friends (so we’re told) and that, my lovelies was the plan so things her are going well\nI manage our business website and various tourism pages on social media. Some of these pages… “www.cerdynvilla.wales” is our lifestyle hub (ooo fancy!), it leads you off to “Pink Butterfly Art and Glass” – my Etsy shop; “Pink Butterfly at Cerdyn Villa” -our FB page combining our B&B and my art; http://www.cerdynvilla.co.uk – our B&B website; “rose-tinted Ramblings” – my blog; “Home of Bog Snorkelling” – the tourism FB page for our town; “@Berni_Benton” – my twitter account\nI’m a gardener – I look after six people’s gardens. Mostly elderly ladies, some of whom like to garden with me and its as much about the company as the weeding and pruning. I LOVE weeding (does that make me odd? I don’t care, I LOVE IT!)\nI work shifts in the local cafe and cover for the owners if they go away. Sometimes I even bake some cakes!\nI blog. For fun, but mainly to keep me sane and promote my work(s) (not necessarily at the same time). Its called Rose Tinted Rambling, but you know that because you are here now. It’s mainly a brain dumping ground. Most thoughts evolve whilst I’m either ironing or weeding and I can’t rest until they’re typed. So there! I try to categorise to avoid you haven’t to read the ‘boring shit’ but I’d say there’s pretty much something for everyone here.\nI advocate for a local elderly lady and manage her finances. It’s my ‘pay-it-forward” – we should all have one. It’s great to give back.\nI volunteer, Working to help run the weird and wacky events in Llanwrtyd – I am the commentator at the World Bog Snorkelling and Man v Horse. They gave me the job because, and I quote “if the PA system breaks I’d still be loud enough for everyone to hear”. Hubby said he could hear me from the house last year and I was three-quarters of a mile away….\n… I hasten to add the mic was working that day.\nI am responsible for keeping our household accounts. Although hubby takes my figures and does the scary bit of filling in the returns and sending them off\nI do all the food shopping, planning and feeding. Sometimes I do this well. Other times we eat out!\nI ‘manage’ a tenanted house with 5 flats. Not for fun, at all, but because the landlords were neighbours but now live in Spain.\nWe keep hens, that means they have a house that needs cleaning\nI’m a mum………\n………………………………………….\n……..in my spare time (!!)\nI do a bit of yoga and belly dancing\nI look after my own garden (sometimes I get dressed before I start)\nI’m a member of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party (say hello to Lady Lily the Pink). I even stood for the Welsh Assembly\nI soak in a bubble bath\nI enjoy a good live band\nI read the occasional book. mostly I read blogs and watch TED talks\nI snuggle on the sofa with my Hubby and watch Netflix\nI play board games with my boy(s) – son and hubby\nI eat out with friends\nI eat in with friends\nI drink out with friends\nI drink in with friends\nSometimes I just drink…….\nI love my life, but planning is difficult. Impossible actually. So it appears chaotic. and sometimes it really is. It also appears disorganised. But actually it rarely is. ….\n….it just feels it\nLogistically its a massive challenge. It’s so far removed from the 9-5 life I used to lead. I wouldn’t change it for the world.\nyou are inspirational, you do lead a full life, so much on!

The perfect type of Winter day on the cusp of Spring. The perfect days for pottering about, tidying stuff up and chopping stuff down. The perfect type of day for pottering about in the garden.\nCerdyn Villa is showing signs of new life and fresh activity.\nI’ve been pruning and tidying and Hubby has been putting his new Christmas present to the test and is chainsawing up the trees we had cut down in Autumn, ready for stacking and drying. In Winter 2019 they will provide our central heating.\nNew hens have arrived. The two older girls, Tammy and Heather (the white one) have settled in and are free roaming alongside all the others in our clutch.\nThe four new Ayam Cemanis (our Goth girls and boys) are a tad too young to put in with the rest of them. They’re not yet old enough to lay. Only 13 weeks old. One is definitely a cock and that’s fine – he can have his own hareem , but if there’s another cock he’ll need re-homing otherwise all hell will break loose. I’ve got a few weeks before I’ll know and a few more before I need to worry, but just in case, I have a new home lined up . In the meantime they’ve got their own playroom to explore\nSo…this conifer.. it was dying anyway…..I lopped off all the branches and then Hubby got out his new Parker ... we all love a good power tool and according to him this is an exceptionally good power tool..\nEvery time I read your posts, I think how well you would get on with my in-laws – they also live in Wales, keep chickens, and create stained glass art! Hehe. We had snow again this week but let’s hope that’s the last of it – I love snow but I’m ready for a bit of warmth now…! #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nwhere abouts in Wales ? x Can’t believe that both times i posted this blog it pretty much snowed the next day. Am not chancing it again 😉\nLikeLike\nOh how I love spring! It is so filled with hope! And we are planning a garden too! xoxo #mondsaystumble\nLikeLike\nI hope the snow hasn’t scared spring away! I bet life has been very different this week… Thanks for linking up with #globalblogging\nLikeLike\nGreat pictures. I hope that if you got any snow, it didn’t kill your beautiful snowdrops.\n#globalblogging\nLikeLike\ni have to admit winter is back with avengence but it was good to enjoy a bit of pre-spring hopefulness for a few days !\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nWe still have lots of snow here! I want it to be spring! #mondaystumble\nLikeLike\nLooks idyllic! The snowdrops are gorgeous, and a husband who cuts wood! Wow! I wish you so much joy in your beautiful smallholding (?) Bernie. Our daffies have just come out and snow is forecast and every time I see them I think (No! just wait another week won’t you!)\nLikeLike\ni’ve been asking our daffs to wait – to be fair they probably wont come into flower for another week or two, despite being in Wales its very rare to have daffs in our garden in time for St Davids Day. Not really a small holding – we only have 2 doz hens and no other animals. would love a pair of alpacas though (unlikely to happen but a girl can dream).\nLikeLike\nLoving the photos. We have been cutting back trees and shrubs this weekend too before it got too cold! I would love some chickens but worry that the dog would attack them. #mondaystumble\nLikeLike\nLove the photographs> Feeling a bit guilty as I haven’t touched the garden yet. Still cold here and I hate winter gardening!!! #MondayStumble\nLikeLike\nThere are so many little signs of Spring, yet this week the weather’s not going to play ball! #MondayStumble\nLikeLike\nI’m currently debating whether it’s too cold to get out in the garden with the chainsaw! Beautiful photos of the snowdrops. I agree spring is in the air but I wish it would warm up a little! #mondaystumble\nNat.x\nLikeLike\nI t seems a bit strange to be reading this when we are being told to prepare for heavy Snow, once that has been and gone we can look forward to spring and hopefully a summer too#mondaystumbleupon@_karendennis\nLikeLike\ntrue! but i prefer to believe it when i see it. The media do love to terrorise us with weather warnings. Last month we had 18 inches of snow but because there was none in the South East , or london it was no big deal to the reporters. Its been -4 at night hear for aver a week and not above freezing during the day… who knows – i love snow !\nLikeLike\nmind you..when i was out there with the hand saw taking off the branches before Hubby got out the big guns, i was toasty warm from all the physical effort 😉\nLikeLike\nI miss having chickens! Love your set up for them.\nLikeLike\nThanks. We have an old railway cattle truck that they nest and sleep in… the old greenhouse that the babies are in has a trap door into the nest house. There’s a n aviary which has a tunnel from the nesting house too so if they need separating we can. generally though they just roam free around the garden and get locked in for safe keeping at night\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

Today I’m ‘hiding’.\nIf I ask someone to paint my lounge say its £10 per hour (yeah its great value here in rural Wales) and the job takes 3 days, it’s £240 plus materials – no problem, no quibble.\nAs an artist, I paint a work of art, it takes the same 3 days. I procrastinate, deliberate and ruminate over what to price it at. I can’t charge an hourly rate like my builder? Can I? How do I value this piece of art? What would be the ‘market’ rate?\nI look at other local artists for inspiration. I seek out affirmation from friends and family. I have a bond with this work. So I think well, I’d quite like it on my own wall. So I think, “how much would I be prepared to charge to let someone else have it on their wall instead”. I price it. I rethink, I add a bit; I knock a bit off, I add it back on again. I ask my artist friends. If I worked it out hourly I feel it would be ‘unaffordable’ in the local market. In the end I price it at what I’m prepared to lose it for.\nBut then a friend wants it. A friend will ask for ‘mates rates’. Ok, I think, this is a friend, I ‘should’ do a deal. So I offer a super special price thinking, its part business/part gift. Its declined. I’m dejected. My self-esteem is crushed. I think “maybe my work is just not very good'” .\nOr, another scenario, someone simply says, “I’m give you £xxx for it” I’m offended. dejected. My self-esteem is crushed. I think “maybe my work is just not very good'” .\nI want to hide. I’m embarrassed by my work. I want to be angry and offended, but I just feel like a fool…….\nIs it all crafters/artists who struggle like this, or is it just me? Are there any other professions suffering from these dilemmas? What do you do about it? How do you price your work?\nGorgeous Bernie,\nI know how you’re feeling. I’ve been here many times, not only in my recent work in crafts, but for many years as a Mentor and Coach and business speaker; I loose track of how many talks I gave for free, often with promises that this would be a “turning point in your speaking life” or begging me as they had no budget because they were a start-up / charity / new concept… and I felt worthless for so long.\nI guess what I learned was this; setting a value for my time and sticking to it is a way of confirming to my self that I AM WORTH IT. I got clients at my top rates, once I started to say no to the people who asked for discount. As soon as I put real conviction behind it, I changed how I felt about my value.\nI believe you are a very talented artist. I think your paintings are captivating, spiritual, free of “pomp” and I’d feel very proud to own a piece of your work. Which I will do. And I will pay the full price for it. Because YOU ARE WORTH IT.\nThe price you asked was probably more than fair, I’d bet I’d have said “F**k off Missy and put that up by 25%” . There are plenty of people who think the price of a piece of art should be the price of a print from Athena (showing my age); why not offer her a limited edition print of the original work at a price she can afford.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_09_01_were_all_a_little_less_ordinary/content_1414.html": "To be honest I can’t say my ‘less ordinary life’ began with the move to Llanwrtyd. truth be told I HAD to move to Llanwrtyd BECAUSE of my less ordinary take on life. Living in Essex i wasn’t interested in straightening my hair, expensive clothes, fake tan, flashy car- I didn’t fit the stereotype nor the reality of living the Hollywood of the UK – at the risk of offending half my friends -to me the large majority of Essex population is more interested in the superficial – what you have, the cash you flash and how you look. I’m more of a how you treat people and whats inside type of girl, ( charity shops and skip rummaging). So turning up to pick Jason up without makeup, in a 40 year old car and in my scruffy gardening/painting clothes just simply did not fit into the ‘appropriate behaviour’ category of an Essex mum!!! Now obviously this blanket slur does not apply to everyone but lets just say TOWIE would not be as successful as it is if it didn’t successfully parody the recognised stereotype….\nI was the sort who had a Charlie Dimmock phase, hand mixing cement and laying a front patio in shorts and vest top with a large umbrella to shade me from the sun one summer; dyed my hair Marigold orange (and left it looking big, wild and back combed). I drove Ffloyd – 1968 Hillman Husky which John painted pink and cream for me and I used it as my everyday vehicle. I let all the school kids clamber around in it and play with the knobs and switches – other mums glaring as their kids were more impressed with the simplicity and quirkiness of Ffloyd than their £40K Porche Cayenne (John constantly outraged at Porche making a 4×4- the Essex tractor!!!); I like(d) to get a bit tiddly in the afternoon with my girlie neighbour.\nThese little shows of anti-estabishmentarianism were signs of the frustrated me unable to hold back. I’d never been a wild child, always the goodie-two-shoes. Never in trouble at school – top results, homework in on time etc. As an adult I yearned to be individual.\nMoving to Llanwrtyd simply gave me the freedom and confidence to embrace the real me. Gardening in my dressing gown, dying my hair pink, writing ‘stern letters’,painting in an artistic way; giving up the day job and the 9-5 routine; drinking champagne and eating strawberries with Alex through a whole summer; winning ‘Best Frontal Display’ and enjoying the irony; hill walking in stilettos; steam-punk, corsets; alter egos;, weird hair, fundraising; running a shop; buying a caravan for use as a mobile gallery; dancing in the street; thinking pink, dressing as a frog…. Being individual; standing up for the right;- being part of a community; giving a voice to the minority (sometimes the intimidated majority) – being free, being brave, being ….joyful.\nNow I look at my family and Johns family and realise every single person I know – and probably every single person I don’t know and every single person I’ve tarred with my flippant slur , yes, every single person is ‘less ordinary’; unique, quirky, individual, interesting . Some people show it, some hide it, some live it, some smother it.\nWhat I love about Llanwrtyd Wells is that it attracts people who embrace their individual uniqueness ,who take joy from being free and individual, who are more than just a little ‘less ordinary’. Bogsnorkellers, free spirits, bathtubbers, ,wheelie bin racers….\nAlternatives are drawn and migrate here, embrace themselves and each other and spread joy, bemusement, amusement and love beyond our little piece of heaven in the Heart of Wales. We shout out to the world and celebrate it.\nTake the time and really look at people. No two are the same – what a design of genius, what a joy and pleasure. Embrace the idiosyncratic, celebrate the eccentricities, rejoice in the uniqueness.\nLife is short, time is precious, people are amazing. Share with those who make you feel great. Learn, live, love, embrace",
  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_11_09_today-my-son-turned-16/content_296.html": "Today my son, Jason, turned 16. 5;11 am this morning being the moment of his birth following a glorious pregnancy and relatively short labour which caused me to leave a party early to head for hospital as my waters broke!\nI find my heart bursting with pride as I lie awake listening to J and friends celebrating into the early hours of today. He wanted to surround himself with friends as the clock switched over from 23:59 on 8th to 00:00 and the beginning of 9th. His friends did not let him down. Surrounded by friends all holding their mobile phones whilst dancing and watching the time tick. As the 9th arrived they cheered and hugged and leapt, lifting J off the ground and we, his parents, had the privilege of sharing that moment with him.\nThis memory will be stored in the brains archives along with a multitude of great friend and family related moments for him to draw upon in his adulthood and share with his own children and grandchildren as he grows older.\nAt this point I raise the point I want to really make and that is that Jason has a group of incredible, great, wonderful friends (young adults). They are polite, loyal, socially adept, and embrace life,more importantly , they look out for each other – reminding any potentially jaded adult that life is truly for the living. sure they make mistakes, but don’t we all?\nI admit that their move from the ages of innocence to experimental teen pushing the boundaries and questioning authority, took me off guard. I faltered and didn’t handle all the situations appropriately . Over- reacting at times, disrespecting teens who were oblivious to their ‘crime’ rather than taking my usual course of discussion and reason. I couldn’t cope with the fast arrival of drinking, smoking, clearing up vomit etc – not often but from the over excesses of teen parties. That move from child to ‘youth’ caught me unprepared, unqualified and without the tools to manage the situations. The teens aren’t the only ones who make mistakes. parenting doesn’t come with a manual. unlike any other job you don’t get training before embarking on the various challenges that face you.\nMy expectations were unrealistic and my responses , on occasion reflected my lack of experience and the feeling of being out of control of the situation. It’s almost like a switch being flicked from when they are kids trusting your advice and rules to when they are teens reasoning, questioning, testing boundaries. So I made mistakes and upset some of them in the same way as they make mistakes taking their ‘pushing’ one step too far. But without pushing to the limit how do you discover the limit? How do you find your equilibrium. Teens aren’t the only ones who are victims of excesses – we all do it – but we are ‘adults’ and society ‘allows us’.\nThese young adults are GREAT. They have a passion for life and the future experiences available to them and sometimes those potential experiences are too tempting to wait for, sometimes they get the balance wrong, eventually they will get it right. We were no different but perhaps our parents knew less about what we did and where we did it. Perhaps we were a little older? Perhaps not.\nMoving from childhood to adulthood requires a redefining of roles and relationship. As parents we have less say in what goes on in their lives, we have done most of the nurturing and we can only hope we did it well enough. The goal , surely, is to ensure they grow into healthy, happy, independent, socially responsible adults. So, as hard as it is to ‘let go’ of our ‘babies’ we must remember that that is what we are here to achieve.\nI look at Jason and his friends and see their passion for all the possibilities that lay before them – adventure, freedom, independence, relationships, life. They make me so proud, every single one of them in their own unique way. some make the transition more smoothly than others but you can tell that all have the skills to get through and to largely, enjoy the journey. and with the friendships they have they will all be just fine.\nLife is so different for this generation of kids. They grow up quicker having access to ‘adult’ knowledge younger through TV and internet. we cannot ‘protect’ them from the pressure to experience more grown up things so early or so fast. We have to equip them with different information from that provided by our parents. both ours and their challenges are so different from those experienced by us or our parents. Our parents dressed differently, listened to different music and socialised in different circles from us. Yet we are likely to borrow our parents/kids clothes, share musical tastes, go to the same parties from time to time. we are also likely to have more open discussion. So we have had to adapt to a different style of parenting. more open, more interactive, with more awareness of what our kids are doing.\nI consider it an honour to have this opportunity, but it comes with challenges and hurdles and i do sometimes falter at the jumps first time round. Mistakes have been made and probably will be made in the future. The intention, however, is always good. It’s a learning curve.\nI love and adore my son and his friends and the way they interact with John and I. I admire them all for the lives they have yet to lead, the mistakes they have made and the lessons they have learned. They are wonderful young people who keep in our minds the benefits of embracing life and living for the moment.\nI am blessed. i have a healthy, happy, handsome and talented son and an extended family of his happy, handsome and talented friends. I am blessed that they come here and feel at home, hug me and call me Mama. Which brings me right back to my opening line. My heart bursts with pride and joy and I feel honoured to be part of their lives for those moments they chose to share with me.\nso, all you boys and girls (young men and women), you know who you are, and I love and admire you all for the potential you have and the joy you bring.\nThis is beautiful, I want my son’s friends to feel that way about me when they’re older 🙂\nLikeLike\nIts a wonderful thing and I feel honoured to be in their lives x\nLikeLike",

That’s just up the road from our home, Cerdyn Villa, here in Llanwrtyd Wells.\nOn the inner sleeve of the album was a registration coupon. If you returned it before 31st December 1975 you became the proud owner of one square foot of the 10 acre plot the band owned. This was part of the promotion activities linked to the album to ensure this piece of land was not taken over by forestry and instead remained unchanged. It was an ecological aspiration…..\n…and here it is today, the plateau in this photo…\nHow do I know all this? Well I bumped into a BBC Wales reporter, who then got in touch with a chap called Gordon Green MBE (look him up) and my hubby, and the three of them went off today in search of the Good Earth Project and found it!\nSo, now you know. Maybe you own the album? Or even one of those square feet? If you do, why don’t you make the pilgrimage here to visit it…\nWell.well.well!\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_09_04_too-many-hats/content_1165.html": "There have been (too many) times in my life when I have taken to wearing too many different hats at any one time. The results have not been pretty.\nOf course I refer to more than bad fashion sense – although there have been many such episodes in that category too. I refer to those times where I’ve forgotten to respect my own body and mind, demanded too much from myself and been ungrateful at the reality of what my mind and body could realistically deliver. During those times I have perceived myself as weak or failing but in my more lucid (!) moments, like now, I can clearly see that the demands I put on myself far out way those I would expect from anyone else.\nWho made me Wonder Woman? I have neither the figure nor costume to pull it off!\nWhen I look back though I also realise that those periods where I have overstretched myself haven’t always or consciously been for fear of appearing weak or of letting people down. They have often been because all the opportunities presented to me have simply been just too damned interesting to say ‘no’ to.\nTake for example organising and running the annual Real Ale Wobble here in Llanwrtyd when it takes place over our busiest weekend of the year. Or giving up paid employment to set up constituted group to run a TIC and starting my own shop so I could be there to man the TIC. Or agreeing to work part time for my old employer in Pontypridd whilst running the TIC, and the B&B. Or standing for County Councillor; or campaigning for fair representation. I could go on – there are so many opportunities, activities, initiatives and adventures to be had.\nI’m sure the last time won’t end up being THE LAST TIME i overstretch myself and have my finger in too many tasty pies at the same time. I’m greedy , what can i say!\nI do however hope and believe that each time I put myself in that position I have become more adept at recognising my predicament and managing it – not by myself but as part of a team with my wonderful partner, John, my son Jason and a deliciously tasty selection bucket full of great friends\nWhen I had Jason I wanted to be a great mum and a great employee/career woman. I feel sure now that I managed a pretty reasonable job of both. However there were many times where I felt I was failing at both – leaving and missing moments with my son so I could work, missing work cos my son was sick or i couldn’t get childcare. Part time work is a real misnomer – basically you get paid for less hours and do more work. I had a 3 day a week contract but because my clients, colleagues and customers worked full time or different shift i would find myself working from home whilst on my off days – all the time. Its a juggling exercise I’m sure many women and those single dads out there are very familiar with. There is nowhere in any of the child raising manuals or in the preparation by midwives, antenatal specialists etc that warns you that born of childbirth is also a lifetime of guilt: am I doing too much/not enough; being to relaxed/too strict,; will my own personality weaknesses and hangups negatively effect my child; if I work will he/she realise the value of self reliance or hate me for not being there? Its a no win.\nUntil that is, assuming you are very lucky , you can come to the realisation that as long as you can say honestly ‘what I did I did with the best intention’. You have to really believe it AND you have to be gracious enough to yourself to realise that that is the only and best expectation and result you can expect from yourself, or, for that matter, from anyone else.\nBe good to yourself, be real, be free.\n…and here’s some photos of me in hats (tenuous link I know!)",

I laugh heartily; love wholely and live completely. I write what I think. Sometimes its fun, sometimes its political, sometimes its frustration, or angst. Always its real and heartfelt.\nI now live in Mid Wales having found a home with my family (John, my parner and Jason, our son) here in Llanwrtyd Wells where everyday eccentricity is celebrated. a place in the UK that attracts those from outside the mainstream and has created an identity based on its quirkiness.

Actually this morning. something rare happened. I bounced out of bed, wide awake and rearing to go at 5:50am! I had ironed 7 sets of bedding before 8am! (I own a B&B – my own bedding does not get the same attention as that for our guest rooms).\nSo I poured myself a glass of milk, and still in my dressing gown, slipped on my wellies and strolled around the garden. It’s a glorious, sunny, fresh morning. The type that makes you glad to be alive. I let out our girls and George (our free roaming hens and cockerel), fed them and then…\n…oops. I made the fatal mistake of bending down to pull up a weed. I made a small pile. Then another small pile. Then I thought I may as well get the wheelbarrow. I’m still holding my glass of milk. I’m chatting to the chooks who are cooing around the disturbed earth left from the weed removal. I’m kidding myself I’m not gardening. I am a vision in red. A couple of dog walkers stroll past the end of the drive. I catch their eye and am about to wave. They avert their gaze.\nAn hour later hubby comes out with a mug of tea. Laughing at me gardening in my dressing gown and wellies. The wheelbarrow is full. I tell him”it doesn’t count as proper gardening if I’m still holding my glass and only one hand is muddy”.\nI am at one with my garden and enjoying the company of my hens as we all scratch the soil together.\nI’m pretty high in the pecking order this morning , I’ve found more worms and bugs then they have. George is a little put out that I have their attention and he’s out on a limb.\nAnyway, another half hour went by as I weeded my way back to the door.\nLovely way to start the day\nThis made me smile. I could so imagine doing the same.\nLikeLike\nYou need help. But then, you and me both know that already don’t we?\nLikeLike\nindeed we do\nLikeLike\n“I made the fatal mistake of bending down to pull up a weed.

As a teen I did pencil sketches of my favourite rock stars, John Taylor of Duran Duran, The Tompson Twins , Midge Ure. They weren’t bad for a 16 year old. I never, however studied art at O level or beyond. The teacher changed, I lost confidence, I was academic so I studied the sciences and maths. I became an an office worker, accounts, credit control, reconciliations, payroll. I was good at it and even enjoyed the companies I worked at. But I longed to be creative.\nI would theme my sons bedrooms. As a baby he had prime colours and rainbows. As a kid he had space rockets and stars. As an older teen – red/black bold daring. I took to gardening for creative release too.\nWhen we moved to our rose tinted life here in Wales I remember telling John that I the artist in me would show itself.\nI joined a local art group and developed some techniques and confidence. I took on a few pet portrait commissions and took photos photos of local trees and copses and rivers using them to develop techniques of shadows, light flow and reflection.\nI learned how to blend the paints and more recently to introduce texture.\nI went on a course to learn stained glass techniques and found it interesting how with glass I had to consider more abstract and pattern use to suggest texture and mood. I designed a several panels for our front door – making up a little ‘storyboard’. and then in our ‘space’ themed bathroom, instead of obscure glass , i designed a panel based on a Whirlpool Galaxy\nWhether I’m any ‘good’ at it, I don’t know. Ii do know its an obsession, I can’t stop. It moves me and drives me. Whether people will like them, enjoy them or respond to them – I guess that’s down to the individual.\nWhat is art? We all have a different view on the subject. If art is the reproduction of a vista/person/object so it is hard to differentiate between whether its a photo or painting , then I guess I’m not very good. But is it a row of coloured dots, an unmade bed, a dead sheep in formaldehyde? If art is anything that makes you think or creates an emotional response then all of life is art. Scientific discovery is art, construction, destruction, making, baking…. everything is ART.\nI am so excited to be part of a two month exhibition at The Wyeside Arts Centre. My first ever proper exhibition. Alongside 6 other artists we explore under the title “On Reflection” – I’ve created 8 pieces, interpreting of space-scapes and sky-scapes in partnership with sentimental quotes that strive to capture the expanse and potential of our existence.\nSo I sit at home, with my partner John. ever encouraging and happy for me to follow my less-ordinary dream . I paint, I cut glass, I solder, I blog, I garden. I create. Its my art and its a bonus if others enjoy it too. I hope some of you do.\nAnd, if you happen to be in the Builth Wells area of Wales on 1st May between 6:30 and 8:30 you can join me and the other artists at the preview of our joint exhibition. I’d love to meet you x",

A perfect home for someone like me who tends not to follow the crowd, doesn't have a quiet laugh, and tends to speak first, think later! Life has reached a juncture where I have become aware that when you live your life through rose-tinted spectacles, every experience becomes one including joy, laughter, friends, meetings, experiences and great memories. Having always fancied being a columnist I figured why not share my rose-tinted ramblings with anyone out there who might want to listen- and if no-ones out there, why not write them anyway - bit like a public diary - but hey I have no dirty little secrets that I'm not prepared to share....!!!!\nA simplified summary of the Welsh Assembly results and how its all calculated\nSo what happened in Wales on the 5th May?

You might be able to book an appointment for about 8 or 9 working days time….\n… Our doctors are all really nice – if you can get to see them! If I have any days booked off work, I actually book an appointment just in case I have anything needs ‘seeing to’!”\nMy intention was never to belittle or question the commitment and support of our local team. We are very lucky in Wales and to have a GP surgery in Llanwrtyd. The receptionists are so helpful and friendly if you pop in or phone (within the limits set them) and when you do see a doctor here you are given as much time and support as you need. My ONLY issue was that damned question\n“Is it urgent?….” will illicit different responses from different people independent of the abstract urgency .\nI still don’t know how to answer the question effectively. what does constitute urgency for a doctors appointment? Any true URGENT medical issue results in calling 999 or attending A&E. By their very nature GP appointments are for non-urgent issues.\nHere are various scenarios, you may have more:\n1. not wanting to be a nuisance-particularly appropriate amongst the elder generation – they might not want to make a fuss or cause any trouble – being asked “is it urgent?” may well leave them in a vulnerable situation if they elect to say ‘no’.\n2. to any hypochondriac, of course its urgent!\n3. its an ongoing niggle that’s been ignored for too long, not got better, maybe got slightly worse, its taken weeks to admit you need a doctor, should it be appropriate to wait another week for an appointment or is the fact that you’ve braved making the call enough to consider it ‘urgent’\n4. you just feel shit – maybe its a cough, maybe , like on the TV ads ,it could be cancer….\n5. you are scared of the doctor (like some people are with dentists) – when you do phone its a now or never – being asked the question may scare you off\n6. if you suffer from stress or anxiety (or have had a Catholic upbringing!) you may be riddled with guilt. Being asked “are you sure its urgent this is the last urgent appointment we have for today” – might create additional stress.\nI’ll just say number 6 applied to me. I felt embarrassed and guilty taking the appointment, got worked up into a state. John had to attend with me as I was convinced the doctor would say I was wasting time and question my decision to deprive someone more needy of the urgent appointment. I KNOW this is ridiculous but hey ho , this is one of my many neurosis’s!!! We all have them so don’t give me that look 😉 .\nAnyway, it all worked out OK, of course. I guess we have to remember and be thankful for our NHS system. OK its far from perfect but not having it would be hideous. I know of people who have died alone in their own home in America because they couldn’t afford to call for an ambulance. That’s just tragic.\nAnyway. Here’s one very funny rant came from a friend of mine and it had me in stitches (please take it tongue in cheek).\n“Is it urgent?”\n– “Of course it’s f***ing urgent or I wouldn’t be calling. I have a perceived medical problem and I want it fixing NOW and it seems totally appropriate that a qualified medical practitioner should deliberate on my issue.”This makes the whole question a redundant one in the first place – the perception of urgency is also a question of ownership. It’s probably not urgent for the GP to see you… whether or not he/she does is unlikely to have any bearing on them at all and if they don’t see you they will only be seeing someone else. Undoubtedly it’s urgent for you because you have chosen THAT point in time, for whatever reason, to contact them directly to address your scabby head. If it wasn’t urgent FOR YOU then you could get an appointment by sending them a letter, or maybe even a carrier pigeon, asking for one at some indeterminate point in the future.\nInstead of the ‘is it urgent’ question, other questions they might ask are obviated in their redundancy since you are not a ‘qualified medical practitioner’ – questions such as ” Is it serious?” or “Is it life-threatening?” are really only meaningful if they don’t get a response, by which time it’s probably too late. And generally if it was serious or life-threatening you wouldn’t be pissing about phoning a GP anyway would you? You’d either be dead or phoning 999.”\nCait O’Connorsaid via FB:- I did try to post a comment on your blog but it wouldn’t post so I will put it here. There is another scenario you can add – make it number 7 – someone could have something wrong which they themselves might not consider ‘urgent enough’ to ‘push’ to be seen but is in fact a dangerous condition which needs very urgent attention and should not be ‘postponed’. Our GP’s receptionists never ask such a question as yours do and appointments are made on a first come first slotted in basis and if our own GP is booked up then we can go to another one a bit sooner. There is also a triage system whereby you can turn up any morning and wait to be seen by a nurse who will deal with the problem if she can or she will call in a GP. I can’t praise our surgery highly enough.(Llandod). I do understand you asking the question you did!\nLikeLike",

John was a quiet, gentle man, happily out of any complicated relationship and dealing with his ‘baggage’ as any good ostrich would!! I was only going to be in the UK for 3 months so I was a safe bet for a fun-filled time before disappearing off into the wilderness. As i said, that was 20 years ago. I don’t like to call in ‘entrapment’…..\nTen years ago, having moved from London and banking to Essex and recruitment / software, we took a weekend break in the wonderful wilderness of Mid Wales in a teeny-weeny itsy-bitsy cutesie-whootsie town called Llanwrtyd Wells. And our lives changed forever.\nWe celebrated our 10th by having a farewell party; a gathering of friends and family and some live music from our brother-in-law and his rock band Hedgehog. Jason was seven.\nThis weekend we celebrated our 20th in our favourite pub in our lovely home town of Llanwrtyd Wells, surrounded by friends and entertained by live music from our son, now almost 17 and some of his, and our, talented friends\nI have made 3 great decisions in my life. The first was not leaving for Africa; the second was having our son and the third was moving to Llanwrtyd\nI love my man more each day. It hasn’t always been easy. Anyone who knows me will understand why…. for sure I am not the steadiest of personalities to live with. I have my depressions, my health crisises, my emotional turmoils. But in John I have my best friend, my soul mate, my counsellor, my anchor, my lover and my life force. Without him and his patience and understanding we would not have an ‘us’ – he has never given up on me and he sees in me the loveliness and goodness that I sometimes lose sight of. He never does.\nI believe I said that each and every person there and those who simply couldn’t be there has impacted on, played a part in and added value to our lives and i am proud and honoured to know that we are in their hearts and they are in ours.\nThis blog may appear slushy and self-indulgent but I think it is a story that anyone can connect their life to … We have friends. We are so blessed. This weekend whilst hosting our celebration i discovered how many amazing and wonderful friends we have. I discovered great friendships blossoming in people I’ve known for 5 minutes and reaffirmed great friendships that have lasted nearly all our lifetime. I even feel good to have disconnected myself with someone I thought was a friend and have finally accepted, is not. I feel great. Energised. Loved.\nImportant dates punctuate our lives and it is appropriate to want to share those with the people you love. And the real people you love will want to be with you even if they can’t. And these punctuation marks in our timelines remind us who our true friends are and how lucky we are to have them\nAnd anyway, with all that aside; what a party!! A weekend of laughter, and joy, eating and drinking, walking, singing and dancing. A weekend of music and friendships of reminiscences and forging strong bonds. Saturday evening in the Neuadd Arms Hotel with friends from near and far. The homely welcoming atmosphere it offers; the great beers brewed on site , the delicious and over generous catering by their chef, Paul. It was said as a joke, but not only are we blessed with great friend but some of them own a pub and brewery 😉 ….\n… and some of them own great musical talent. We were entertained by mandolins, drums, cajons, congas, guitars and great vocals – organised by our son and performed as an open jam… I am so proud and happy to know so many great people. I am so proud and honoured by our ‘extended family’ of Jason’s beautiful and talented friends. I cannot thank Jason, Georgia, Tyler, Zak and Lottie enough. Young, talented, thoughtful, and a joy to be with. I also thank Ian, Eugene and Paul for performing, and am humbled by the distances some people travelled to share our moment. (And of course i thank Mr Badaxe for his memorable involvement – lol )\nI am loved and I love back. Generously, unconditionally and wholeheartedly. My friends, my son, my partner, Our life together…..\nthis blog is dedicated to all our wonderful and cherished friends\nThat’s lovely Bernie – so nice to have been there – thanks for that – and great to meet your friends / family from further afield – wonderful evening – and in another ten, let’s do it again X\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_04_04_politics-is-insane/content_464.html": "Politics is complicated.\nI don’t profess to understand it nearly enough. But unless you’re a career politician (like most of those running our country), then you probably don’t understand much of it either. Its almost like its deliberately really really complicated so we think we don’t know enough to have an opinion or we can’t possibly understand so our opinion might make us look silly.\nI don’t understand most of politics.\nI feel that much of the system is about misrepresentation, and playing the system. Its a power game, involving a lot of spinning (ie; sales speak) to get us to think that one person might represent us better than another and that our vote might make a difference. We are lead to believe we have a choice\nI don’t think the political system is fair. Not everyone’s vote counts\nBecause its complicated its hard to see how we can make a difference. Here’s some points – made simple so I can understand them and do the maths!\nThere are 650 seats in the House of Commons. A party needs to win one more than half to form a majority government.\nEverybody lives in one of the 650 constituencies that the country is divided into. Anyone living in there who is over 18 should be registered to vote\nSay (to make it easier for me to do the maths), where you live there are 1000 voters, and there were 5 parties to chose from (blue, red, yellow, green, purple). Let’s assume everybody makes a vote. Say 240 voted for blue and the other 760 votes were split between the other 4 equally so all the others got 190 each. The blues would win this seat even though they only got 240 of the 1000 votes. That means that slightly less than a quarter (25%) of the people wanted the blue team to represent them but now they do..\nThis is the system of politics in the UK and it’s called “First Past The Post”\nAn election is won if one ‘colour’ gets more than half the seats. So if blue get 326 seats then their top man (or woman) becomes Prime Minister\nSo they could win half the seats each with a quarter of the voters. That means only 1/8th (12.5%) of the voting population wanted them to be in charge. OK this is very extreme but with our system of politics it could happen (eek!!!)\nPolitics is not democratic\nIn the last election only 65% of the population, who could vote, did vote.\nSo lets do the maths again. If in your area of 1000 votes only 650 turned up to vote for one of the 5 colours. If blue got 170 votes and the other 480 went equally between the other 4 colours (120 each) . Blue would get that seat despite only 170 of the 1000 people voting for them (that’s only 17%).\nAgain if only half the seats need to be won by blue and each seat is won by only 17% of the votes, then the blue team runs the country with only 8% of the people wanting them there.\nIn theory, worse case scenario.\nBad isn’t it.\nAs only 65% of the voting population actually voted in the last election. In reality at best our current Government, The Conservative Party is representing the country , with, at best only 35% of the voting population wanting them there\nThat’s not fair is it?\nThere are probably a million reasons to not bother voting\nWith 35% of the population that can vote choosing not to, I would, if I were in charge, wonder why. Why is it that one out of every three voters doesn’t want to, chooses not to, or can’t be arsed to vote?\nI don’t blame them. With the system we have its hard to see what the point is. First Past The Post is not representative of the populous however you look at it.\nThere are loads of reasons you might not bother:-\n- maybe none of the parties say anything that means anything to you… most of it may as well be in a different language\n- maybe there is just so much ‘spin’ you can’t work out what each party stands for. It’s like advertising for sanitary products … do any of them really do the job better than the others\n- maybe each party is just so busy slagging of all the other parties they all seem like bickering in a playground\n- maybe the system is so unfair that you think your little vote won’t make a difference… but there’s always a chance 9i bet you sometimes by a lottery ticket).\n- maybe none of the parties are even talking about the issues that are most important to you\n- maybe you just don’t trust anything that any of them are saying (after all they so often change their minds once they win)\n- Maybe politics don’t interest you (I have to admit I’m even boring myself now)\n- maybe you’re sick that day or something happens and you meant to go but couldn’t\n- Maybe you don’t have a polling station near enough to you and you don’t drive and you didn’t consider a postal vote\n- Maybe you can’t read and the whole idea is too intimidating\n- Maybe it was raining and you just didn’t want to get wet\nIn the past (and because I don’t know much about politics I can’t tell you how long ago), if you turned up at least and spoilt your paper at least you could register your distain for the system. A spoilt paper was like a vote for “None of the Above” and when the results were announced you would be told how many papers were ‘spoilt’. at least as a disgruntled voter you had a voice, even if it was a little squeaked that might just turn the odd head for a second or two.\nThese days those papers just get discarded. And if you don’t turn up at all you go down merely as part of the overall statistic. so in the news it will say ‘election turnout , 65% of the electorate turned out to vote”… you would be one of the 35% they didn’t mention\nWhy am I a Loony? (The eternal question…..)\nApart from the obvious, “I blame the parents”…….\nI have been accused that standing as part of The Official Monster Raving Loony Party, is making a mockery of the hard won fight for our right to vote.\nHowever, in my mind our system of politics is downright unfair, crazy even. Positively insane, in fact. And if we’re going to run with an insane system then I suggest why not vote for it.\nI don’t know why the other ‘Loonies’ are loonies. Unlike members of most political parties we don’t have to think as a collective. We are allowed to express our own opinions, we do not have to ‘tow the party line’.\nI stand because I want to highlight the hypocrisy, injustice and minimal input of democracy in the UKs governing process.\nI stand because I want to encourage people who, like me, don’t know everything there is to know about politics, to vote anyway\nI stand because I want people to start talking about politics.\nI stand because the system sucks, its not fair, it’s not fit for purpose and I want to rebel against it\nI stand because I can. Despite the system and its failings, we live in a country where we still have the right to free speech.\nI stand because EVERYTHING is political. EVERYTHING is affected by politics. EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF LIFE.\nSo its important\nAnyway, my message to you is this: DO VOTE. Whenever you get the chance. Let’s not have the decision made by 65% of the voting population, lets have it made by all of us.\nOn the 5th May 2016 there are the Welsh Assembly Elections. It may seem complicated. When you go to the polling station you will have THREE voting slips. One is for individuals standing to represent their Party in your constituency; One will be for Parties representing a Regional seat. There is also the vote for the new Police Commissioner.\nYou may have been lucky and been visited by representatives of parties… sometimes this is because they care, or because they want your vote, or both. Some Parties will not have visited you, that might mean they don’t care, or they think they’ll get your vote anyway so are a bit cocky ; or it may be that their party doesn’t have the resources to send people out (like many of the smaller parties). I personally think that within Wales, particularly within Brecknockshire and Radnorshire our Conservative MP is a waste of space, he only turns up if there’s a photo opportunity or an election and he rarely stands for the individuals in his patch. I also think our Welsh Libdems do a fabulous job. I think Kirsty Williams is the best representative we can have for Wales; she turns up , she shouts out and she genuinely cares for the individuals within the area. But that’s what I think, it might not be what you think. What I think might completely get your back up, but thats Ok , you have your own opinion and you are allowed to think and vote how you like , that’s my point.\nAs Lady Lily the Pink, I am 1 of 7 Loonies standing for the Mid and West Wales Regional vote… on the slip alongside the other parties it will say “The Official Monster Raving Loony Party”… . There’s a group of Loonies standing in each of the 5 Welsh regions. There are no Loonies standing in this election for the constituency vote… I told you it was complicated, politics is like that.\nWell done for reading this far, I have a tendency to waffle (why use 3 words when 30 will do it more annoyingly!!). Anyway, consider this (why not): if you don’t usually vote, why not vote unusually.\nThe Official Monster Raving Loony Party\nVote for Insanity, You Know It Makes Sense\nDisclaimer: This blog post represents the views of her Ladyship, Lady Lily the Pink and her more serious alter ego, Bernice Benton , and may or may not have any bearing or relation to the opinions of the Monster Raving Loony Party or the individuals I like to think I am representing. I speak for me , as me , and through me…. maybe some of my thoughts and opinions work for you too…\nOne thought on “I’m Serious, UK Politics are Insane… (point 1:the voting system)”",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_06_07_in-out-shake-it-all-about/content_201.html": "I’ve refrained so far from blogging about this but I can no longer contain myself. Sorry!\nI’m sure we’re all just about sick to death of the EU Referendum and its spin, scare-mongering, slagging off and assumptions about each side from each side.\nMy main though is that if it were to make any significantly dangerous difference we would not have been given the chance to vote.\nMy second main thought is that its important to vote… especially the younger and new voters… have a political/economic interest in your future, you have earned that right\nAnd my third main thought… well, I’ll share that at the end if you make it that far!\nPersonally I’m voting leave, but you may think differently, that’s fine, it doesn’t make me a racist or you an idiot, or any other personal attack comments being flung about. Find out as much as you can. Don’t think you’re the only one who feels like they’re lacking enough facts to vote. Trust your gut and go to the polls.\nBe sure of this though. There’s no unbiased information out there . There CAN’T be any factual information about the future of a post brexit UK because it hasn’t happened yet; plus we’ve never left the EU before and nor has anyone else in the same way ; plus it will depend very much on actions and decisions yet to be taken after the vote if the Brexit is a majority. We also CAN’T be factual about what will happen after if we remain. again it hasn’t happened yet; it will depend heavily on how the EU treat us if we stay after being so vocal about wanting to potentially leave; and the decisions our representatives make on our behalf post-referendum.. so everything is best guest and biased to the views of the side presenting the statistical analysis…. remember all the fear created about not taking on or taking on the Euro – all bullshit in the end but presented as fact!! The banking collapse, etc etc …we are not good at predicting the future even when it potentially involves no significant changes…. the world is like that.\nANYWAY:\nThe information below is borrowed from a chap called John Wright (many thanks Mr W)\nDemocracy doesn’t exist in the EU especially if anything it’s a secret dictatorship.\nThis one of the best explain actions I’ve seen so far about the EU referendum Credit goes to John Wright.\nThere seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about June 23rd, and people want to know the facts. Here are some:\nYou are not voting to leave the EEA or WTO, meaning all of the UK’s trade and benefit agreements will remain unchanged should we leave, until such a time that the UK decides to renegotiate them for any reason.\nYou are not voting to leave NATO, meaning our security agreements remain unchanged. Should we receive an act of hostility from a non-NATO member, then NATO countries are obliged to come to our assistance. This does not change.\nYou are not voting to leave the UN, G8 or G20, meaning Britain will have the same voice on the world stage as it does today.\nYou are not voting to leave Europe!! The UK will still, geographically, be part of Europe. Non political organisations aligned to Europe will still extend membership to the UK (I.e. sports governing bodies, and so on).\nYou are not voting to stop recognising Interpol, Europol and neither are you voting for SIS / MI6 to stop dealing with other intelligence services in the fight against terrorism and global, organised crime.\nYou are not voting against being able to travel to Europe, contrary to the belief of some fools recently on TV. The UK has always maintained stricter border and passport controls than many EU members. This will not change. You will still use a passport to go on holiday and you will still be allowed entry to countries in Europe. You may even get chance to skip queues by using the non–EU queues at the airport (the only point so far that is my opinion, and not necessarily a fact).\nThe UK economy will benefit to the tune of £billions in the first year after we leave.\nMedical and science research will not simply stop. The UK pays into the EU to then get money back in the form of funding. The UK will now be in control of this money and can choose to fund whatever UK-based medical, science, art or other research it chooses.\nFarming will not lose money because of EU funding being cut. The UK negotiated a rebate of some monies that the UK pays to the EU, in order to subsidise UK farmers. Instead of asking for our money back, we can give it straight to farmers. No change there.\nYou are not voting against human rights. The EU Convention on, and European Court of Human Rights are not part of the EU. Until parliament passes a new bill of rights for the UK, these will still apply, as will precedents already passed down to UK courts from Brussels.\nYou are not voting to kick anyone out of the UK or block access to anyone. Neither are you voting to stop recruiting valuable European workers into things like the NHS. Like my other point about passports for travel, the UK is already outside of the Schengen zone and so migrant workers must enter the UK with a valid passport before and after June 23rd. That will not change. British borders maintain full control of who comes and goes. Should someone have the skills to apply to work in the NHS, then they will still be permitted travel and given an opportunity to apply for a job. Worst case, points based assessment, like the US, Canada and Australia use, will come into effect. The UK is likely to negotiate freedom of labour movement though, in exchange for freedom of goods movement.\nYou are not voting to move jobs nor production out of the UK! The EU actually helped fund the move of Ford Transit production from the UK to Turkey… Yes, the EU helped give UK jobs to people in Turkey by giving Ford a loan of £80m with very generous terms!\nWhat you are voting for is UK sovereignty. You are voting to stay in or leave a political union of leaders and representatives that you British people did not elect. You are voting against a commission of unelected, elite men that nobody at all voted for and yet they make decisions on our behalf. You are simply voting to bring sovereignty back to Westminster, and that is all. If you worry about that because you don’t like the Conservative government, look at the reality. Their majority in parliament is very slim. They have been blocked on big decisions already. You are therefore not giving sovereignty to David Cameron, but to the UK House of elected representatives. Do not be fooled by the fear campaigns that are simply run by the wealthy, who need EU money to thrive! Think about the future, and your family’s future\nAnd finally, as promised, my third main thought…\n…is that whatever the result; whether we end up in or out , we will have certainly shaken it all about!! As we in the Official Monster Raving Loony Party believe, that is our raison d’être. As people in a democratic country it is our job not to let the representatives, beaurocrats and powers that be become complacent and any more egocentric than they already are….\nBE LOUD,\nQUESTION EVERYTHING.\nREMEMBER, THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER\nDO NOT BE AFRAID TO THINK FOR YOURSELF\nI like it ! xx\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_02_25_dont-worry-its-just-pmt/content_1282.html": "I suffer from PMT\nI’m not alone, there are millions of us who do.\nSymptoms vary.\nI’m 48 now (shock horror, how the hell did that happen). Alongside PMT I now get hot sweats… the start of the menopause, but still all the joys of monthly bleeding, cramps and emotional distress..\nIts taken me until now to really realise what is happening(to me)\nEvery month this happens:\n- I get anxious – to varying degrees\n- My boobs become painful\n- My skin flairs up, it itches, gets spotty, gets drier in some places, greasier in others\n- I could eat the entire contents of a sweet shop and still want more\n- I become intolerent (more so!)\n- I get clumsy and accident prone\n- I becomer more forgetful\nEvery 3rd or 4th month some or all of these symptoms are worse\n- I am so anxious I can’t function\n- My boobs are so tender they hurt when I walk or turn in my sleep. My bras hurt – on or off.\n- My skin is so inflamed I can’t hide it with makeup, I need antibiotic cream on prescription to abate it\n- I’m not safe behind a wheel as my spacial awareness is shot… driving is a really bad idea\n- I break things by missing the counter top or knocking into things\n- I become so tired and at the same time sleepless that I cannot function ‘in the real world ‘ for a day\n- oh… and the blinding migraines that make me vomit and vomit and vomit\nThe medical system does not recognise PMT properly, for me its a disabilitating condition at least 4 times a year… I cannot drive to work, I cannot hold a meeting, engage in a debate, have a balanced conversation. When I worked in an office and covered a territory by car this illness both physical and mental had a profound impact on my attendance and performance.\nFor years and years and years I’ve had individual symptoms treated. I’ve discussed with the doctor (various doctors) that I felt many of my problems were hormonal or exacerbated by hormones. NEVER. Not once did any of them, male or female acknowledge, discuss, or access this as a possibility.\nI’m not alone.\nI’m not even an extreme exception.\nWhy is all so difficult?\nHow are you affected ? What are your experiences with your doctor? Or Employer?",
  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2018_01_26_i-know-its-only-1-month-in-but-i-already-have-progress-to-report/content_597.html": "So last year I didn’t set my 2017 action plan until mid February. This year I was all done and dusted with ‘getting my act together’ before last Christmas. I was exceptionally smug about how I’d caught up with myself by the end of the year. And I continue to wallow in my smug self-satisfaction as I celebrate the (near) end of January 2018.\nI am ahead of my game.\nI’m focused. I’m energised.\nI’m (over) achieving !\nI appear to have got my multifaceted act together.\nTo be fair I’m not really smug, but I am genuinely elated by how much energy I’ve leapt into 2018 with and how much momentum I’ve rolled with. I mean, blimey, 4 whole weeks and I’ve not had a meltdown; an identity crisis or fallen into a self-confidence hollow. I am on a roll.\nI put this down to two things.\n#TheJanuaryChallenge : this little package of fun and well-being run by charitable organisation 64 Million Artists, invited anyone and everyone in the UK (and beyond) to spend a few moments of each day mindfully contemplating something creative: be it drawing your self-portrait in your spaghetti hoops or expressing yourself using the medium of GIF, it afforded a period each day of self-expression, and an opportunity to engage and have a bit of banter with other individuals enjoying the daily micro-challenges. OK I didn’t actually post in every challenge of the month , but I did contemplate each one to varying degrees and I did enjoy reading the posts of those who did. The best thing is , there was no pressure to engage, it was simply a joy to do so.\nSecondly, 2017 had been working towards my first ever solo art exhibition and the event opened on 12th January… a serious kick-start to my artistic self, my self-esteem and focused my mind on challenging myself – Lucy of What My Fridge Says made me her featured blogger #19 in the third week of January. That was and still is very exciting for me. But the very best bit was the most lovely words she used to describe me and my blog. It made me realise that my blog reads and represents me exactly how I hope it would\n…When I read her blog it seems to me that she is living fiercely, boldly and with risk…not to mention enjoying the journey – Rose Tinted Ramblings of a life less ordinary , these\nattributes are certainly something which I find magical. Plus, she drive a pink car – whats not to love. Click the link above to read about her first solo exhibition. Despite loving every second and going for it, she also captures her anticipation and anxiety beautifully. Often anxiety is seen as a mental health issue and connected to worry, but I really do see anxiety as showing you care and when used to drive the vision of you dreams, it’s often complimented by accomplishment. This lady could teach the world a thing or two.\nSo I’ve hit the ground running in 2018. I’m aware that in reality I can’t run at this pace solidly throughout 2018 and there are bound to be some challenges and setbacks thrown in along the way but, for just right now, I am very focused, slightly ahead of myself and feeling pretty mighty.\nSo at the end of month one how do the stats add up?\n2018 is the year of LEARN, APPLY, INTERACT\nso far I have\n- been the first featured blogger for Hayley of Mission Mindfulness new guest series blog spot ” Words About the Weekend”\n- been a featured blogger by Lucy of What My Fridge Says on her co-hosted twitter linky #thesatsesh\n- held a successful preview event for my first ever solo exbihition\n- …and sold a painting at it (it’s on until 17th March if you happen to be in Mid Wales before then)\n- been paid a deposit for a commissioned painting and have until November to complete it\n- been commissioned to design and make a window for a couple new to our village\n- been booked by a WI group to do a talk bout the stained glass window project I was involved in last year – not until October but booked on New Years Day\n- set out workshop dates to run sessions from my home studio teaching small groups stained glass – and have some people booked on some of them\n- created a pricing structure for commissioned work ( but not properly put it into practice, for example i never remember to ask for design payments up front or deposits)\n- have read so very much in my effort to learn and improve my use of social media (particularly twitter and wordpress). Have linked up to Ben Huberman over at WordPress, in an attempt to get more from my blogging. Plus, though twitter linky #blogcrush ( run by Wendy at Naptime Natter, Alice at Letters To My Daughter and Lucy of Lucy at Home ); discovered the very generous Hayley of Sparkles and Stretchmarks. I do plan to pick her brain more if she doesn’t mind because her success and openness on how to make a living from blogging is not only inspiring and surprising -I genuinely had no idea !\n- I have 25 more twitter followers, 11 more blog followers and 7 more FB followers – small changes but a step in the right direction\n- I’ve even been making stock items of some of my glass designs…. I have hens and blue tits ready to find their forever homes..\nI’ve even achieved on my personal positive plan.\nI have been eating less bulk, more healthily; drank more water; suffered less stomach discomfort (goodbye acid reflux) and am less bloated from skipping the alcohol. This has translated to having lost half a stone without even noticing (ie not felt like I’m missing out, hungry, deprived) and looking a darn sight healthier (less puffiness, clearer skinned). I’ve been dancing and I’ve given myself the extra 10 minutes I need in order to walk rather than drive into the village. Both of these activities have the added benefit of boosting my energy and sense of wellbeing.\nAll in all, one twelfth of the way into 2018 and things are going well. I promise I wont do this at the end o every month, but just right now, I’m feeling pretty damned elated and I wanted to share it with YOUx\n#thesatsesh popping back with the linky loving 🙂\nLikeLike\nGo you!\nLikeLike\nIt’s so lovely to hear you sounding so positive Berni!! Well done on all you’ve achieved so far, it’s epic! I could do with some of your enthusiasm, mine started dwindling last week and I’m running very low on resources!! #BlogCrush\nLikeLike\nWhat an amazing start to the year. Your list of achievements considering we’re only a few weeks in is something to be proud of. Hx #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\n#thesatsesh blooming adore this. I agree with the comments above – keep going girl! What a fabulous 2018 it will be x (p.s.meant every word)\nLikeLike\nwoohoo, you go girl X\nLikeLike\nWay to go!\n#blogcrush\nLikeLike",

People hating people because they are sick or disabled and need support; because they need help housing and feeding their family; because they have chosen here as a safe haven from war and tyranny; because their homes have been destroyed and they have asked for our help to find a place; because they can’t find work; because they dress differently; have different coloured skin; different accents; different sexual desires; different houses to pray to their god(s). How petty do these sound? .. say it ‘ I’m afraid of you because you pray in a mosque”; “I hate you because you like to wear women’s clothes” ; “I hate you a because you are too ill to work and have sought help”; ” I fear you because irrespective of the fact you were born here, three generations ago your ancestors came here from….”…. It’s takes a crazy and sad person to think like this.\nIf you want to be angry, be angry about the corporation that control supply and demand across the globe; be angry about a system that makes the wealthy wealthier but keeps the poor poorer; be angry about our political disregard for the longevity of our planets resources; about the millions of people starving, raped,beaten, mutilated ,murdered in corrupt regimes; about the misguided individuals with pathetic weak minds who follow radical extremism; about those who target the susceptible and innocent and abuse their trust, sex traffickers, slave traders etc.\nTerrible atrocities happen across the globe on a daily basis. We as humans often ignore or don’t hear about the those horrific incidents outside of our own country. In light of the terrible happenings in Manchester this week a friend of mine wrote this:\nI wanted to say something – and its so hard because everyone is hurting but I hope you get where I’m coming from if you read this – now is not the time for opinions on who or why – its not a time for division or conspiracy theories or even politics …..\n….Humans are suffering every day at the hands of evil. Simple as. We are led to believe that we are separate. That somehow borders and seas and distance make us ‘different’. But love and compassion and humanity should recognise no such borders. I am not ‘British’ or ‘European’ or anything else. I AM TERRAN. I AM OF THIS EARTH.\nALL suffering hurts my heart.\nALL injustice makes my soul weep.\nAnd so as I stand with Manchester 22.05.17 and I hold in my heart all those who are suffering and the 22 souls lost and the 50 plus injured and the people who have seen such terrible things I also stand with Deir ez-Zur 21.05.17 and the 15 lost and the 60 plus injured – most of whom were also women and children.\nBaghdad – 20.05.17 – 35 killed, 45 injured.\nTuz Khurma. Maiduguri. Hamah. Mastung…\nThe list goes on.\nI’ve not listed which countries these places are on purpose – because an innocent soul is an innocent soul and leaves a hole where once there was light.\nHold your loved ones tight. Love love love. Be kind. Be compassionate. Educate yourself. Help others on each and every occasion that you can.\nI love all the light being sent to Manchester today…what power, what beauty.\nImagine if we could send out that wave each day to each person who needed it – how powerful we truly would become.\n‘There is more that unites us than separates us’\nLook at us all on that tiny sphere. So fragile and yet so very strong. Separateness is an illusion used to control us. I send love to my brothers and sisters all over this beautiful planet today and everyday\nAndrew Burnham, Mayor of Manchester, quite rightly said that the “Manchester terrorist no more represents Muslims than Jo Cox’s killer represents white people”.\nExactly.\nIgnorance and laziness cause people to condemn an entire race, religion or country because of the act of the odd nutter/extremist… this plays right into the hands of every extremist movement, creating fear, hate and intolerance within communities… we are all people of the Earth , we may elect to follow a religion (generally based on which country we were raised and what our parents believed), we may follow a cultural behaviours based on the same, but these evil behaviours are not the result of any religious scriptures or cultural behaviours, they are the behaviours of weak-minded, warped individuals with a twisted sense of reality and a total disregard for humanity… we must stand together, arm in arm with our neighbours, irrespective of their skin colour, their dress code, their age, their sexuality, their religious beliefs or their ancestry….\nWe must not let the media propaganda (media terrorism) warp our minds into believing their rhetoric… Everyone is an individual being of our earth.\nMy only faith is the one I hold for Humanity; that humans are predominantly compassionate and kind and that we can, as humankind, drive out this culture of intolerance and hate without resorting to vilification of entire groups … we must stand together and give of our hearts, share of our minds and support of our being…\nI may not have the best words or the most articulate response, but as always, I speak straight from my heart and mind and these are the only words I can find for the horrendous atrocities of this week… and I speak not just of what happened in Manchester …\nWhat a great heartfelt blog, so totally agree with everything you have so eloquently written.

A few years ago we both engaged in Dr & Dr Eades Lose Your Middle Aged Middle, eating plan. It worked. We both lost several inches around our middles.\nHowever, and here’s the biggie for me, the diet plan made us completely antisocial. Not because of the bad breath you might obtain from living solely on protein… we were very careful about our oral hygiene; but because it made it almost impossible to go out socially.\nBy making a few tweaks to the diet to better encompass our lifestyle we did find a way. For example, in restaurants we could have ham egg and chips without the chips or a mixed grill again without the chips. I recommend you ask the waiter to leave the chips off the plate altogether because its much tougher just to choose not to eat them when they’re there and smelling so damned good!\nFor Hubby it was a great diet, He loves nothing more than a high meat content meal. He loves grilled bacon and fried eggs for breakfast every day. He doesn’t have high cholesterol or blood pressure so that’s OK. According to the doctor he’s fit as a fiddle (even for a man of his age 😉 ) He could even stomach the disgusting body builder high protein meal replacement drinks. I, on the other hand would wretch at the smell of them so in the end I just didn’t bother with the shakes at all.\nOverall the diet was successful, we didn’t feel hungry, we weren’t miserable and we both lost 1.5 – 2 stone.\nSeveral years on our weights have exceeded our pre diet weights. As with all diets, they just plain don’t work long-term. UNLESS you can find dietary habits that fit your lifestyle and the new eating regime becomes your lifestyle choice.\nWe’re trying again. John is back to high protein / low carb and I’ve taken from the Dr Eades book those recipes and tips that worked before and done my own thing for him. For Hubby I cook up loads of interesting meat based or egg based meals and he can have as much cheese as he wants with those. So I make lots of creamy/cheesy sauces which he loves, and as long as he supplements his diet with potassium, magnesium and multivits, hes a happy bunny.\nI decided I don’t do as well on high protein and low carb. I could do it short-term but it wouldn’t be sustainable for me. I prefer veggie options quite often and would rather have no meats than all meats. I struggle to give up fruit and salad and much of that is a no go if you are being a strict no carb dieter.\nI’ve chosen to cut out cake/alcohol/chocolate and crisps. and drastically reduce my bread and cheese intake. Funnily enough the only one I’m struggling with is crisps. I crave them constantly. I’ve replaced those with natural seeds and nuts and I salt those myself – it seems to (almost) satisfy my needs. I also discovered during the first diet that nuts and seed vary greatly in their carb/protein ratio .. i can’t have walnuts but i tend to stick to hazelnuts, almonds and pecan and add pumpkin seeds to the mix.\nVery occasionally I crave chocolate but other than a couple of teeny treats. I’ve managed that too, even when I’ve had PMT (big high-five to me). (BTW I cannot stand carob, it’s NOT an equivalent option in my opinion, I don’t care what anyone says! I’d rather do without completely. )\nThese days there so many great alternatives on the market and many of them can be bought in mainstream supermarkets.\nThis alternative to spaghetti is available in our local Aldi store. It has 6.6g of carb per 100g compared to 76g in standard durum wheat spaghetti, most importantly hubby likes it and it only takes 3 minutes to cook. So I can stick to my normal whole-wheat spaghetti and make a bit of this for him.\nOf course there are fresh veg options to spaghetti, which are really easy to prep yourself but can be bought pre prepared , for example courgetti (which I think is available in the fresh veg section of most supermarkets these days – but is a very expensive way of buying fresh veg #justsaying) . Really easy to make yourself though.\nI make hubby mashed cauliflower or cauliflower cheese to sit in place of potato on his plate. But you can also rice cauliflower….and if that sounds like a lot of hassle you can even buy it ready done… (I got this in Tescos)\nThen there are all the alternative flours. I bought The Groovy Food Organic Coconut Flour from Tescos in my home delivery. Only 16g carb compared to plain flour at 81g\nI bought it to make this Fat Head low carb pizza base with a recipe from Ditch the Carbs.com (thanks Graham Miller for this link) thinking it would be a good alternative to almond flour (which Tescos didn’t have ). Subsequently I’ve discovered this Sukrin sesame flour with only 6g carb (although it was in my local whole food shop Vans Good Foods in Llandindod Wells; and it wasn’t cheap).\nSo how did the pizza go?…..\nI doubled up the quantity as Hubby can easily eat a whole normal pizza to himself and I can usually manage with a bit of patience and persuasion. However, these were so filling even though his was bigger than mine we each only managed half.\nBasically you plonk the mozzarella, and flour in a bowl with the egg and lightly microwave and it will mix into a dough – ts hard to believe, its like a magic trick, I really didn’t expect to get a rollable dough but…\nTAH DAH!!!\nAfter that its simply a matter of cooking the base, 15 mins in a gas 7/225 degree oven, taking it out, adding your toppings of choice (pre-cooked especially meats), then popping them back for 5 more minutes. Whats more, Hubby said he would happily eat it again. I would too but I might try the coconut or almond flour, I did find it a tad over sesame-y. Extremely filling though and lovely rustic looking.\nJust so you know, this post is not affiliates or sponsored in any way. I have tried the products purely for our own health wellbeing and my views on the outcome and mine alone – as they would be even if someone were to ask me to review something (which I am more than happy to do #hinthint 😉\nWow there’s so much practical advice mixed up in this post. I’ve never done specific diets, but I do go through periods of cutting down on “treat” foods when my weight is starting to get a bit on the heavy side. However, chocolate is my downfall so I will totally high five you back on managing to curb THAT craving! #blogcrush\nLikeLike\noooo sounds like a great diet especially when you don’t feel hungry, makes all the difference X\nLikeLike\nThis pizza looks great! You make it look easy. I may have to give it a whirl.\nLikeLike\nLooks good.I eat way too many carbs as well so I shall take inspiration from your cheery ramblings!\nLikeLike\nexcellent! give it a try – really easy and a bit like performing magic! lol\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_04_14_if-you-dont-usually-vote-vote-unusually/content_583.html": "It was a BIG day for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party yesterday. A MASSIVE DAY for me.\nIn 1983 David Edward Sutch (Screaming Lord Sutch, 3rd Earl of Harrow) founded the Monster Raving Loony Party and stood in over 40 elections in his career. In my mind he was a political activist using comedy, satire, music and outrageous clothing to draw attention to, and raise awareness of the idiosyncratic nonsense within the British Political System. He got politics to the people who thought politics wasn’t for them. He was an inspiration.\nYet through all the years and all the members of the Loony Party who have stood as candidates in local elections, by-elections, national elections; the party has NEVER qualified for an election broadcast.\nThat all changed this year. They have enough representation across the five Welsh regions to qualify for a Party Election Broadcast for the Welsh Assembly Elections 2016. It was aired on 13th April 2016 before and after the news on BBC 1,2 and ITV (ok only in Wales but that’s good enough for us)…It was also on the radio (that was a bit surreal)…\n…and here it is !!! I LOVE the announcements.\n….and I’m in it!!! I am SO PROUD.\nDid you know that on 5th May 2016 there are 3 votes for everyone in Wales to cast?\nConstituency Candidates, Police Commissioner, Regional Parties\nThis year there are a ‘Laugher of Looonies’ standing in each of the 5 Welsh Regions. In Mid and West Wales, my area, there will be one box noted “The Official Monster Raving Loony Party” and listing 7 names ” Lady Lily the Pink, Tristian Shout, Lieutenant Jager Schnitzel, R U Seerius, Helen Swindon, Lord & Lady Dunquan, Knigel Knapp”\nI’m Lady Lil, I’m also the election officer for the region, I think that’s why my names first on the list!!\nWhy do I stand? I stand because of all the nonsense in British politics today, I stand for those who feel unrepresented and I stand for those who feel misrepresented.\nPoliticians can promise all sorts of things whilst campaigning and in their manifestos. When it comes to the crunch, if they win they often U-turn, change or add policies which may have made you make a different decision. It’s all spin, hype and manipulation.\nI want to point out these practices that are complete insanity. So I stand. And I thank Screaming Lord Sutch & Howlin’Lord Hope for leading the party and The Reverend Backline (Defrocked), Nick the Flying Brick and our fantastic film editor, Gordon Vowles, for casting me in a key roll.\nOur motto is “if you don’t usually vote, vote unusually”…….\n“Vote for Insanity, You Know It Makes Sense”\nLike I said; political parties can promise all sorts of things whilst campaigning. All they want is your vote. They want to WIN and they’ll say anything to get in. It’s easy to promise things when you don’t have to deliver. But when it comes down to it, if they win there is nothing in place to prevent them doing whatever they like. There is no process to effectively complain if they start doing the opposite of what they ‘promised’ or add in new policies which may have made you make a different decision at the polling station.\nWe all know some of what the main parties have promised and some of the many u-turns they’ve made once getting the job. Did you look at the party manifestos last May and think “oooo I’m all for a bit of fracking in our national parks.” or ” you know what I think? How about we fund the education of nurses and doctors and then treat them like shit so they leave the country once they’re qualified.” or ” you know what would be a great idea? I really think that privatising our education system, leaving it unaccountable and running it for profit is the best way to raise the next generation. I wonder if there’s a party out there that will offer me that?”\nThats why the manifesto is meaningless, the party is not obliged to follow anything they said before once they have the power…\nIts Insane. They might just as well have a MANICfesto……..\nOur MANICfesto A-Z\nA.AIR bags will be fitted to the Stock Exchange immediately, ready for the next crash.\nB. BRITAIN will exit Europe and join the Duchy of Cornwall to benefit from tax exemptions.\nC. CAPITAL Punishment will be opposed on the grounds that it is unfair to Londoners.\nD.

FRIVOLOUS Fraud Office setup to inspect fraud too silly for the Serious Fraud Office.\nG. GREYHOUND racing will be banned to prevent the country going to the dogs.\nH. HALF the grey squirrels will be painted red to increase the red squirrel population.\nI. INNOCENT prisoners will be released in order to reduce prison overcrowding.\nJ. JOBSEEKERS will be made to stand two abreast in order to halve dole queues.\nK. KIDS will be made to sit closer together on smaller desks in to reduce school class sizes.\nL.

NATIONAL debt will be cleared by putting it all on our credit card.\nO. OAPS will qualify for a Summer Ice Lolly Allowance if temperatures exceed 70 degrees.\nP. PUDDLES deeper than 3 inches will be marked by a yellow plastic duck.\nQ. QUITTERS will be encouraged not to start in the first place to improve their self esteem.\nR.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_09_20_end-of-summer-and-a-new-chapter-begins/content_577.html": "Last week I wrote about that lovely long summer just gone, the one when the kids are eighteen and have finished school A-levels in mid June and have right until mid-September before their next chapter begins.\nI wrote about the summer and concluded with the promise of a follow-up to this:\n“…….I was determined to discuss with you the trials and tribulations; nerves and nausea caused to these teens in the preparing and planning for their next chapter… ……… As I type this (or in between paragraphs ) I’m preparing his ‘final supper’; his favourite meal; one he feels he’s unlikely to ever eat again…. …… I sense a heart warming afternoon…..possibly a few tears (mainly mine); probably a sleepless night and then tomorrow a drive to Cardiff. I plan to be the ‘cool mum’ the one who offers ‘just the right amount’ of support/detachment/emotion/comment… I plan to leave with a hug and a smile and let him get on with it…. we all know what they say about the best laid plans…..”\nBut it’s interesting, having let the weekend pass, arrived home and spoken to other ’empty next’ mums I realise what I need to write more about is not the teens next chapter but ours.\nWe all spent the last 18 years preparing our children to be capable enough, independent enough, wise enough, balanced enough, skilled enough to move forward and flourish in that middle earth between childhood and adulthood; that place where they can practice independence with the safety net of lecturers, faculty heads, parents, family, to turn to and return to in times of insecurity, panic or concern.\nWe each spent the whole summer ensuring those teens had the best final summer they could. We spent our energy, talking them through their options; preparing them for the results; creating plan B’s and plan Cs ‘just in case’; helping them fill in forms; organise accommodation, grants, loans,; purchasing kit; opening bank accounts; maybe teaching them to cook or use a washing machine. We were their mentors, therapists, agony aunts, parents. We help them with nerves, we helped them pack, we lent them or gave them whatever we could. We then drove them with positivity and confidence to their new locations where we stayed ‘brave and strong’ and helped them unpack; deal with more forms; maybe deal with nerves and tears ; took them shopping (again) to stock their fridges and cupboards. If we were lucky we met their new flatmates; checked in on them again the next day; took them for a meal.\nThen we came home.\nThen we mums (dads/carers/guardians) realised we had been so busy preparing them for their next chapters we hadn’t realised we needed a new chapter of our own. Just in these two days with a quick straw poll of mums I know I have come to the realisation that the empty next moving forward plan has not been on any of our ‘to do’ lists.\nI genuinely thought I had it sussed :\n“I plan to be the ‘cool mum’ the one who offers ‘just the right amount’ of support/detachment/emotion/comment… I plan to leave with a hug and a smile and let him get on with it….”\n…and that is what I did. But now I’m home. I cried quite a lot today.\nI’m not sure how much/little to message/interact with him by social media is reasonable but I’m pretty sure that at the moment its ‘too much’ and I’m probably getting on his nerves!.\nSome mums talk about feeling ’empty inside’ , ‘at a loss”, ‘bereft’, ‘redundant’. For us all it’s the end of a massively long and all-encompassing chapter and because the chapter didn’t end until we safely delivered our teens to their next starting point, none of us have had any time to prepare for ourselves. I feel sure that our next chapters will be equally as exciting and rewarding as the last. We just need a bit of time to adjust, regroup and rediscover ourselves.\nI’d be interested to know how you parents out they felt when you found yourselves with an empty next. Or are feeling, if like me, it’s just happened. Sharing your experiences will act a bit like a support group for us newly bereft parents… please comment here on this blog so we can start-up some social interaction counselling….\nlovely words x thank goodness for social media eh. I talk to my son most days because of it. goodness knows how hard it must have been for our parents – and I can’t remember giving it much thought! what a terrible daughter i was!\nLikeLike\nWe are just at the start of the second year of leaving our youngest at his university. He is studying half way across the world and we are blessed to be with him here in the UK for the start of the second year as we were for the start of the first. All of the same feelings which you have articulated so well have come back as we prepare to say goodbye again. It’s a little bit easier – but surprisingly not much easier! Again I hope we have taught him and prepared him enough for this new world of being an adult, despite him having shown all last year he’s successfully on his way to being a fine young man.\nWhen we return back home I will like you be redefining my role in our physically empty nest – I’m pretty sure it’s never empty emotionally\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_04_30_lest-we-forget/content_709.html": "Perhaps a religious person would say this was the work of the devil… but these innocent millions should have been protected by their God.\nOne comment on a previous Atheist blog post of mine answered the question of rape, pedophilia, famine and other horrors against humans (both with and without faith) with this comment :-\n“I cope with the suffering in the world because in my reality, with a loving and just God, justice is always served in this world and the next. Your world without God is unjust. Simple as that.”\nSuch comments that wash over mass human suffering make me sick… just NO.\nI cannot articulate the strength of feeling I have about this.\nLest We Forget\nTolerance and free will has been given to all mankind from God. What we do with it is up to\neach of us, evil or humanitarian. It’s mind boggling, sickening and horrific that one person can influence so much death. There are examples of this evil all over the world happening now and all through the ages. Struggling with the behavior of humanity is the hardest part but that doesn’t imply we give up on God. I dove into the dark depths of the sex trade slavery in hopes to help the young girls who had no hope, and dying. For each one saved or spared there is a miracle. Evil men are running this evil business, not God. Our hope is in a Big God, way larger than any misery imaginable. Everyone has feelings like these,\nI think it’s normal to seek out answers in a way we understand.\nAll the best\nLikeLike\nThe view offered provided reason for fairness: that a loving God always makes everything fair, by his nature.\nIn your unfair world, where is the justice for rape, torture, pedophilia, natural disasters??\nNo where, that’s where.\nYou are sickened by a godless reality, and so am I. If I were you, I’d be hopeless. Are you?\nLikeLike\nIt was the work of men, exercising their own selfish interests using their power over others. Why should the millions of innocents that were killed be protected by their god? Should a god make the world fair? Please explain how that world would work. I would suggest that the world you want is illogical. Without freedom there is no love, without love, there is no freedom.\nWith no choice to do bad things, no one can do good things.\nWe feel empathy at the suffering of others. We should do everything we can about that suffering to remove it.\nThat comment in no way washes over human suffering. It gives reason to pressure justice.\nWithout God, you have no complaint against the atrocity because it’s simply a different societal view from your own. The morals that produced it come from a populations own ideas of justice. There is for you no moral standard. Just natural species development, wherever that may lead. In this case, the German people decided that killing, starving, torturing the Jewish people was perfectly moral, in their view. The universal standards the God entails they rejected, as do you.\nI would suggest that you align yourself with the atrocity and have no reason to oppose it, whereas a person who believes in God firmly condemns the immorality of the action, based upon the necessary moral attributes of a god.\nLikeLike\nWhat strange reasoning you offer for a god. Do you believe in imaginary friends and fairies too! Religion is the root of evil. Without religion, you have to take responsibility for the fact that humans can do amazing and terrible things. There is and always has been a need for religion, so that weak and vulnerable, and lazy and careless people could claim “god told me” or “god will save me” or “god did it for a reason” sadly, because they don’t want to admit they messed up. It is very sad that, in this day, we have progressed so little since Stone Henge.\nLikeLike\nagree wholehardedly with you. This whole thing about anything bad happening being human sin or man denouncing God, but if in a terrible natural desaster, man saves one victim, that is accredited to God , not man. I am an atheist through and through. One life, , humanity controlled, be good, be kind, treat others how you wish tyo be treated themselves.. Leave people to believe their own man made religious stories (yes man made) if it makes them happy/safe or wehatever but don’t suggest religion offers a moral compass – history proves again and again that this is not the case…. Even the Christian religion (which man made up some time mid roman era changing from poly-theism) sought to kill those who refused to convert and believe what the latest King/emperor/ Church told them was the correct thing to believe at the time…\nLikeLike\nDid I reply to you Dinah and John? I don’t remember. Just for fun I will anyway. It’s always good to talk! 🙂\nImaginary friends and fairies are incomparable to God. I’m sure you’re aware of the definitions of all of those. I find that people are the cause of most evil and not religion, although I would have no problem joining you in the condemnation of religion, statistics show that other causes other that religion are responsible for evil.\nHow are you even voting evil anyway? Without God there is no moral absolute with which to judge. Only subjective morals, so any moral standard agreed upon by a group is law. So for instance, slavery and the Holocaust are quite moral sans God.\nHumans can do terrible things indeed. God demands honest and truth, because he is those things. Following him isn’t an easy cop out as you suggest, but precisely to take responsibility.\nIt is sad that with centuries of accumulated wisdom is tossed out as irrelevant by people who are all but ignorant of the subject.\nI’d suggest you go educate yourself and do being so closed minded.\nLikeLike",

She tells me now is the time because this latest design of mine was recently officially unveiled by HRH Prince Charles and its a blooming masterpiece!\nShe is right of course. (because she is very wise). This window is the culmination of six months work, created through a most wonderful community project in Myddfai Hall, Brecon Beacons. I had the honour of designing it. Pulling together the ideas from those engaging in the project and translating those ideas into this image and then scaling it up and selecting the appropriate glass to make their imaginings a reality.\nIt’s hard to put into words the joy, pride and sense of achievement this project brough not only to me and the co-teacher, Lesley Griffiths (if you ever need a bespoke table or lamp, she’s your woman) but also to every one of the 30 members of the community who took part. I think I should leave it to them to articulate our joint achievement\nIf you are looking for a bespoke stained glass panel, window or sun catcher then get in touch, I am happy to do design and scaling up only; design, and make; or design and teach you to make it!! No obligation quotes. Pricing depends on size and complexity of design. If you have a budget in mind I will happily let you know if your dream piece is possible within it!\nI work from my home studio in our B&B in the Heart of Wales Berni Benton, Pink Butterfly Art and Glass at Cerdyn Villa\nemail: pinkbutterfly@cerdynvilla.co.uk\nYou are so incredibly talented!

That’s such a gorgeous piece. You should definitely feel ever so proud of what you have achieved. And to be unveiled by HRH Prince Charles too.

Thanks so much for joining us for the #DreamTeam linky. x\nLikeLike\nI love your work and I’ve said before that window is amazing! I had no idea HRH had unveiled it though – what a claim to fame!

So whilst I rejoice the end of a fabulously life affirming twelve months and embrace the next with gushing enthusiasm and passion; I am aware that many are peaking around the edge of the slightly ajar heavy door expecting further trip hazards and taking an intrepid shaky first step incase they step on a landmine.\nFor those out there to whom I have access, I hope they will use my stronger foothold and grab on for support. For sure there have been times when I have tethered myself to them for guidance and balance. For those across the globe, in different countries, counties, towns and households, where I cannot personally hold out my hand , I can hope for human kindness from within each persons individual network of support and community; I can offer to advocate and speak out for any injustices where I can add my voice to a cause. For those who are isolated and alone; barely treading water in their personal wild ocean of life, may I have the compassion and awareness to reach out with others of humankindness and offer an anchor and an island on which they can rest.\nIt’s a new year. We will all have new challenges. But we never have to face them alone. Let us be individually great and provide love and community to those we know and love and also to those who we may never know but we can choose to love and show compassion towards.\nEmbrace your life. Share your strengths. Allow others to support you at times of need. Show compassion. Share your love. Smile at strangers. Be the best of humanity. Even if it seems against all odds, let peace, love and kindness win through. Start with your own heart. Hug. Or to embrace the life that has embraced me; let the world feel a good heartfelt CWTCH.\nHappy New Year World. Bring it on!\nHow blooming lovely are you. I’m thinking you are my kind of 2017 chick #eatsleepblogrt\nLikeLike\nthank you and the feeling is mutual\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThis was really lovely! I absolutely agree and hope with you that those who need that support will reach out to those around them or if others see someone who needs it, offers help.

Once telecoms industry privatised, the customer (I you, me, EVERYBODY) was basically totally fucked (excuse my language) the minute any of you were to have a problem that needs fixing. Like a bunch of kids breaking your favourite vase – you will never find out who did it, they’ll all just blame each other.\nEleven years ago we moved our ‘services’ from BT toTiscali as BT were complete arses during our move… we upped sticks and took the line, the broadband and the phone away… what we didn’t realise in this ‘act of rebellion’ was that we might not have any contract with BT but they still own all the lines so when there is a problem our provider has to creep to BT and see if they’ll help out and fix it. So from day one we were up the swanny. At some point in time between then and now some regulations were put in place and BT Openreach were the ‘missing link’ providing ‘customer service ACTION’ between the script readers with your (our, their) providers and BT who own EVERYTHING\nAt some other point we tried to switch provider again for a super great business rate. And at some point again the Welsh Government got some spare cash together and decided to solve Wales’ telecoms problems with a national SUPERFAST CYMRU solution…\n… and their folks is the start of the ‘nightmare months’.\nEver since the Superfast Cymru work in December the broadband here fluctuates from 6 to 0.6. with the low speed lasting from about 4:30 pm until at least midnight (I’m then in bed so it may be slow until breakfast).\nSuperfast started the work and put in some new cabinets to which our house is not connected we are ‘too far away’ . The cabinet is not (??) connected properly to the BT exchange as the BT exchange is ’20th Century’ (I quote the latest in a long line of BT Openreach engineering expert) and “what you need in LW is some 21st century telecoms tech”.\nSo anyway I message Superfast and they say “nothing to do with us mate’… apparently they didn’t touch the ADSL ‘plumbing’.\nBT say ‘nothing to do with us mate your contracts with TalkTalk”.\nTalkTalk spend 4 months denying they provide our Broadband so can’t provide our wannabee new provider, Axis 4 Business with the appropriate code to switch. (but there is a separate nightmare chapter)\nEventually TT (previously written Talktalk) accept we are their customer . TT engineer booked and is here for 3-4 hours says “nothing to do with us mate”. Complaint is ‘escalated’. We are told to stay in for an engineer ALL DAY Monday. We do, no-one comes. TT say, ” no we didn’t book someone we only scheduled that we need to book someone”. (I know right!). BT Openreach Engineer comes, one of us can’t go to work, says after 3 hours, “that’s fixed mate”, leaves .\nTT call from us saying it’s not fixed. 2nd day off for Openreach 2nd visit. 5 hours here. Line checked from house to exchange. “it should be fine now mate”. Call to TT to say it’s not fixed.\n3rd day home for an Openreach Engineer. No-one arrives or calls. TT ask if probelm is fixed. PROBLEM IS NOT FIXED\n5th Day off for BT Openreach Engineer… We have 40 plus speed readings from the last 4 days listed for him. Apparently we are ‘better than most’. He tries a spot of ‘expectation management” says the problem is probably our “virtual speed” as the “actual speed” is fine and has been for months now (!!!! I KNOW). I say, “surely its the speed WE GET that matters” , he agrees. Says it might be a “Hot Vat “(of something like that – he’s a bit cocky and likes to name drop promises to ring his mate at Superfast “i can’t believe its a year til they come back and do the second fix”, says He. He says that “Hot Vat” or whatever it was is “that Exchange in town runs at capacity when there’s low demand so can’t cope at peak times.”\nHere’s the crux. BT would need accept this as a problem and “they don’t like to do that ” but we’re lucky as HE is a senior so he’ll talk to The Man. THEY need to agree that the exchange exchange needs to be a priority for change!\nGoes off to ” check the line between our exchange and Birmingham (!!!! I KNOW!!!) …anyway apparently “nothing wrong with that mate”.\nAPPARENTLY “problem is with TalkTalk”\nAPPARENTLY “they can’t cope with peak demand, victim of their own success” (!!!! I FUCKING KNOW!!!!!!!!!)…. TalkTalk BT Openreach British Telecom AXA 4 Business ALL OF YOU … now personally I don’t give a flying whatsit whose problem it is, I just want the problem fixed!!! I’m self-employed , had 5 days at home – lost earnings for engineers who all blame each other…. SORT IT OUT YOU’RE LIKE A BUNCH OF BLOODY KIDS AN ITS DRIVING MUMMY HERE INSANE.\n…sorry readers … not the ‘rosetintedrambling’ you expect from me but ARRGGHHHH MUMMY NEEDS A RUM\nsomeone i know emailed me this : ” The more I read about your broadband issues and from others, the more I realise we are indeed screwed.\nFor towns like ours to get fibre BT openreach need to put fibres from their main centres to our local exchanges. Super fast cymru has limited funds from Welsh Govt to give to BT Openreach to do this. But it only pays for about 80% of properties to be connected. They connect a few in the town near the exchange then move onto the next town. If they connected every person in every town there I’d simply not enough bandwidth in their main pipe to their main exchange.\nBT openreach could of course use their own money to upgrade..but why..they would never gain enough money back from the investment.”\nLikeLike\nMaybe you don’t need Superfast broadband; you just need and ISP that doesn’t throttle your bandwidth during peak hours? Zen is one of very few ISP’s who don’t do that, but maybe another is still accessible to you? ISP’s call this throttling ‘traffic management’, and that’s what you’re suffering going from 6mbps to a tenth of that. Of course, they don’t tell you they do that when you sign up.\nLikeLike\nTwo words: Zen Internet.\nLikeLike\nnot here in Powys…\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

Ususally I sit down and compose some sort of annual review in the form of a ’round robin’ to send to elderly relatives who don’t follow facebook. Obviously any of you who follow me , know every good and bad meal I’ve ever eaten 🙂\nI am a prolific FBer. I wear my heart on my sleeve and I am far from shy when it comes to expressing my views on those taboo subjects of religion and politics.\nAll my posts are public so if you don’t already look in on me, you are very welcome! (FB: Bernice Benton or Twitter: @berni_benton) I just don’t see the point of hiding it, I’m not ashamed of any of it. Everyone knows when I’m suffering from anxiety or having trouble with some corporations customer service (or lack thereof). Its no secret that I oppose bombing Syria; am incredulous to the elitist politics we are suffering in the hands of David Cameron; despair at the ineptitude, greed and immorality of our bankers, politicians and tax dodging corporations ; am a devout atheist; love satire and politically/religiously incorrect humour; and enjoy much of the eccentric and alternative. Its also no secret that I love and am so proud of my partner, John of 21 years and our son Jason who recently turned 18.\nI’m not writing a round robin this year, although life has been great for the Crompton/Benton household and life in the stix of Mid Wales continues to be my salvation. There is too much going on outside our safe haven to begin to put pen to paper. However I did come across these photos. In 2011 I was suffering very badly from anxiety and panic attacks. Everything fell away, I had to stop work and I hid at home not able to leave. My sanity was largely held in tact through planning a garden party. My friends and family and their support and enthusiasm made a bad year into a great special memory.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_04_22_if-only-i-had-the-energy/content_1492.html": "I’m writing this with one eye shut, hiding under a blanket in shame, hoping you won’t notice me. An irrational thread of worry that you will find me pathetic. A big dollop of feeling like a fraud.\nI have this battle going on in my head ( imagine that image in movies with the saint and the devil on each shoulder whispering conflicting messages into your ears).\nI’m knackered. Totally and utterly drained of energy. My head is trying to formulate action my body is in total all out protest fight. I am not functioning.\nOver the last week my body has ached more and more. My brain has fought against my body harder and harder. Today my body is on strike, a barrier has been built between my mind and muscles and my head hurts from bashing itself against it.\nI’ve turned to mush. I managed to get up and serve my guests breakfast with all the energy, smiling and chatting that goes with that. I had some breakfast and argued with my body to prepare for action. It’s the most glorious day. I have 5 outstanding gardening jobs to do. I’d rescheduled 2 for today and 3 for tomorrow.\nThe only thing my body would do was lay down. The only thing my mind would do was switch off. I lost my gorgeous sunny morning to sleep. Asked hubby to wake me around noon… It was an impossible task. I dragged myself downstairs at two. Microwaved the cup of tea he’d brought me two hours earlier. I sat on the front door step hoping the gorgeous day would energise me…. I fell asleep with my head against the door frame.\nI’m not ill. I shouldn’t be exhausted. Yes, I do a lot but I don’t really put in full days like I did when working for the man. I love my life and the closet of hats it comes with.\nI do see a pattern. Note my post “life: mine:it’s full: .. Shortly after I get to the euphoric with life point; the feeling of reaching a perfect balance. Shortly after exalting the joy and contentment I feel to my world, I run out of fuel and fall into decline.\nWriting my last blog ( “life, mine..”) it was after our quiet season and into the growth and rebirth of the next. Spring had sprung. Guests were booking into our B&B; gardens needed tending; buds were forming on the trees and bushes; all those tender fluorescent green shoots dancing in warm breezes . Snowdrops, crocuses and daffodils; Camellia, forsythia and grape hyacinths splashed colour onto life’s canvas and everything, including me, felt so alive and vital. And then there was overload.\nThe week that included Easter was beyond busy. So many hats to wear at the same time. They were too heavy. “But hey,” thought I, “Get through the week and then rest”. But the next week was even busier….. “I can do this”, I thought. Most of the demands were things I love to do: glass, cafe, guests, gardening. However there were what felt like a zillion other little things that needed to be done too. Tiny jobs: organise an electrician; message tenants; collect my new glasses; shop for food; make veggie sausages; meet up with friends; buy a birthday gift.\nMy body started to protest. Everything ached. Then it ached more. My brain failed to send messages to the right parts of my body. It took 40 minutes mid-week to persuade my body to get off a chair and walk back to the car to drive home. At the traffic lights I had to battle with my eyes not to close and just have a little cat nap.\nToday I’ve just slept. I’m sure I feel worse for it. Not only are guilt and shame raging through me. Also totally embarrassment and a sense of patheticness. Then panic. I have so much to do. The weather is perfect to do it. I would really enjoy doing it too. The customers would be so happy too, I love visiting these elderly ladies and chatting whilst gardening. But I’ve done nothing. Not even told the customers… I know this makes it worse but I just can’t, I’m just not there. The party I should be at tonight, I just can’t go. I know I can’t persuade my body to put on clothes and go out, it just will not cooperate. Hubby will have to phone, I’m too ashamed.\nI’m going to stop now before i go on about how much stronger, stable, capable everyone i know is; how much more everyone I admire does etc etc… I know its a short phase rest will resolve. So, despite my guilt I’m going to search out a sun lounger and go and snooze in the garden. Will battle the guilt later xxx\nMissed you babes, but never feel guilty, i love spending time in your company but respect your feelings and ive been ther too. Remember im here when you want to dance but im also here when you want to cry xxxxxxx\nLikeLike\nI’ve been there. Still go there. Have you had a blood test? I was prescribed iron as I’m anaemic and it does help with the drowsiness, at least xxx\nLikeLike\nTrying to get my thyroid level right. plus peri-menapausal. Am sure neither help. I think i expect too much of myself too. So frustrating xxxxxx will get my iron levels checked , thanks for the suggestion x\nLikeLike\nYou don’t need to feel guilty about anything. I’m not surprised by you current state, body and mind. You do too much! Just remember, you’re allowed to say no. Rest now and get off that merry-go-round. All will be well xxx\nLikeLike\nits hard not to feel guilty when you have to let someone down. plus had not to get stressed about it because it just gets added to the backlog… but trying my best – splept all day yesterday. Did one of my gardening jobs today\nLikeLike\nBernie, it’s all a lie. No-one else actually copes better than you – they just lie about it. On a good day you do a gazillion times more than I ever do even on my best days. That feeling you’re describing, in our family we call it lead-bum, because we can’t get our bums off the sofa. I’m sorry you’re having a day like this today… but it truly is nothing to be ashamed about…\nLikeLike\nthank you. I guess i’m used to running around juggling loads of things and accepting there are times when i can’t do that these days is really hard to accept – plus learning to read the signs before i crash and burn ..\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_08_07_33/content_1280.html": "I’ve noticed from time to time in life, and more and more as I get older and relax into my own skin, that the more real , relaxed and rosily my view of the world the more great people, experiences, opportunities and enjoyment i give and receive in everyday life. Its a great revelation to finally be consciously aware of this basic formula of life.\nWe’ve just had a wonderful time in Scone on the Perth Racecourse for the Imp Club National – that’s another story and one I’ll share another day very soon, but our return journey just highlighted, emboldened and double underscored this delightful rose-tinted theory on life.\nAfter along long drive in convoy heading for home we got to that point where we just had to find a campsite. We’d had the where-with-all before leaving last week to highlight with a pink marker the motorway free 412 mile route between Llanwrtyd Wells and Scone in our old fashioned road atlas and highlight with an excitingly hopeful pink ring those geographic areas that offered campsites.\nfour hours of driving later at around 8:30 we’d made it to our half way-ish home point and reached SHAP on the border of the Lake District ,and on the Coast to Coast Trail – lovely pink ring on the map, teenage son confirms presence of campsite using the internet and we get directed by local knowledge and old fashioned talking to New Ing Lodge.\nScott, one of two brothers working in partnership was on hand with a warm friendly relaxing welcome. As always I jabbered away and the result was that , rather than re-pitch the tent on their camping field we would avail ourselves of real beds in one of their dorm rooms – sounded fab – indoors for one, no tent man-handling for another, properly plumbed toilets for a third.\nBut the evening very quickly got a darned sight better and better and even betterer! Scott caters for his guests providing pre-booked evening meals at 7:30pm nevertheless we were offered the opportunity to have the kitchen reopened and on noticing a small bar in the corning serving on tap local ale we realised we may have found our Tuesday night utopia. Home cooked free range chicken and local butchers ham hock pie in a creamy tarragon sauce with a mountain of buttery new potatoes and several pints of local ale from the Eden Brewery\nIn the small bar sat Andy and Stu; a third of the distance complete on their Coast to Coast cycle with the journeys progress only impeded by the quantity and quality of the brew found at each stop. We (John, Jason & I) joined them in a game of ‘higher / lower’ complete with some good old Brucie catchphrases , some drinking and much laughter and chat.\nIn the corner of the bar stood a four stringed guitar. ” we have a 6 string in the car” says I ” I’m sure if the pies good and you fancy it, Jason will provide some strumming for a sing-a-long after we eat”.\nAnd there began an evening of interesting strangers, out- of – tune singing, much laughter and finally some of Scott’s quality gin & tonic with a slice of lime – that’s not on the bar list so he ‘doesn’t serve it’, Best G&T I’ve had , imagine how good they’d be if he actually served them!!!\nAlong came Arte, an amazonian giant of a man from Holland on a walking holiday – shoes off to dry in front of the log fire he joins our sing-a-long complete with a bowl of Scott’s pasta bake (its now about 10:30pm and this is whats left of the dinner Scott made for himself). The house Labrador , Tia, cwtches up amongst us as Scott pops out to pick up his girlfriend leaving us to switch off the lights when we’re ready . Warm welcome, wholesome food, log fire, great other guests and an impromptu night of beer and entertainment.\nA jewel of a find on our way home to Wales , giving an extra sparkle to my rose-tinted trip.",

I laugh heartily; love wholely and live completely. I write what I think. Sometimes its fun, sometimes its political, sometimes its frustration, or angst. Always its real and heartfelt.\nI now live in Mid Wales having found a home with my family (John, my parner and Jason, our son) here in Llanwrtyd Wells where everyday eccentricity is celebrated. a place in the UK that attracts those from outside the mainstream and has created an identity based on its quirkiness. A perfect home for someone like me who tends not to follow the crowd, doesn't have a quiet laugh, and tends to speak first, think later! Life has reached a juncture where I have become aware that when you live your life through rose-tinted spectacles, every experience becomes one including joy, laughter, friends, meetings, experiences and great memories. Having always fancied being a columnist I figured why not share my rose-tinted ramblings with anyone out there who might want to listen- and if no-ones out there, why not write them anyway - bit like a public diary - but hey I have no dirty little secrets that I'm not prepared to share....!!!!\nIt’s not every day that Ingrid Tarrant asks to borrow a bath towel…\n...It was some years ago that we moved to Llanwrtyd on a whim and with little or no thought and even less planning and preparation.

Its not a darkness or greyness that overshadows my mind and makes the whole world seem negative…It doesn’t create the panic attacks or need to hide away that a dark cloud would do… like they used to.\nThese sensations sit in my gut, like they’re churning and curdling inside me. They come without warning and are tough to shift.\nSometimes I can pinpoint their origin. It might have been from bumping into an ex-friend, or a simple throw away comment within a conversation. Or from a place.\nThis sensation engulfed me as I toured around a house clearance. The ‘negative engery’ purveyed my whole body. As I walked home I felt a deepening saddness and cried. After that came this increasing unease and unrest.\nI’ve never really thought much about spirits and ghosts, conscious afterlife etc. But I do believe that energy sustains. In death our energy (maybe this is what others call the soul or subconscious) must move on. Its a basic law of physics…”energy is neither created nor destroyed”. Our body decays and the component parts return to the earth, nitrogen and neutrients feed new plants and life.\nI also having a ‘weirder’ belief that all materials absorb energy to a greater or lesser degree. Take old fashioned cassettes… they’re just a material that ‘absorbs aand replays’ sound….{Ok techies – take the piss} I believe that to a lesser extent bricks absorb sound. In fact the fabric of any building does. The building replays recordings of conversations held within its range, we might not hear it back with our ears but its there.\nWhen I walk into a building I ‘feel’ the building. We all do I think, some buildings feel happy, others sad. It has nothing to do with the appauling or perfect decor, or the cleanliness of a place. Its a subconscious vibration in our inner ancient being. I’ve been into new builds and felt nothing at all. Just impassive and blank.\nWhen we visited our current home it looked terrible; crumbling walls, blackened flaking wallpaper, dirty carpets, the filth of coal dust and dog hair and a space to big to be maintained decade upon decade. But the vibrations were good. The house sang a joyous song.\nThe building at the weekend was pained. I cannot properly describe it but some of that pain has burrowed into my core and I cannot shake it off.\nSounds crazy. Maybe. But I’m sharing it with you all. Feel free to reflect and respond…..\nWonderful post Berni, and I’ve felt this too.\nOur old home just outside London, was on the market for £10K more than any other in the street, but as soon as we arrived in the driveway, I knew we would be happy there. We lived there (mostly very happily) for 22 years.\nIn December 2014, when we saw the home that has brought our worlds together, in glorious Myddfai, I got the same feeling, again before even going through the front door – or gate in this case. Just knew; I could feel the cottage and garden crying out to be loved. It felt not just like we’d found the home of our dreams, but that the cottage had been waiting for us. It was on the market for a very long time and the people living here were so sad and miserable, I do believe that energy had impacted the cottage and grounds.\nI love how honest and connected you are with your feelings. Thank you so much for sharing and I hope you have a wonderful day in your amazing home, which welcomes and invites you to feel relaxed from the moment you get to the driveway.\nmuch love, Dinah xxx\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_10_12_focus-aspire-inspire-an-update/content_914.html": "So way back in February (because by resolve somehow missed January ), I wrote a blog Focus, Aspire, Inspire. I meant to assess my progress quarterly by Blog and ‘regularly’ (?!) in my thought process. and to be fair I did review my progress in May, and was actually pretty chuffed with myself. Somehow I was largely on track with my aspirations and inspirations. I’d tried to keep them realistic and it seemed to be working. Now its blooming well October and it seems I have lost a little focus, as I do, so I thought a little readdress would be a good thing\nGoal 1: Twitter following: @Berni_Benton I have 556 followers but to be honest I’m more interested in engagement and interaction. I love it when the little counter shows a notification for a comment or retweet . I have become needy for these affirmations of my wit and relevance. I don’t know if I’m getting it right. I spend most of my time on twitter slagging off Donald Trump. AND I’M NOT EVEN AMERICAN!!! – See, loss of focus. But he is such an easy target….\nGoal 2: Sort out my twitter lists: yep, pretty much done that, but now I have ’em what shall I do with ’em. Still. Tick.\nGoal 3: Blog following: I just looked. I always forget to look. I have 140. which, considering I only aspire to 150 by year-end is not bad. In Feb there was 114 of you, so weyhey and ‘welcome’ my new friends. Perhaps you might share me and help me find that final 10 souls who might like to read my random rantings, musings and insights on no particular subject and no particular time. I can but ask eh?\nGoal 4: Blog viewings: well they are heading in the right direction, but I guess they would, you can’t ‘unview’ something so the only way is up, baby (sorry, just Yazoo popped into my head right then…Focus damn it!)_\nGoal 5: Teaching: Yes. Am doing more this year and am planning to run private sessions for small groups from my home studio in 2018 so again, tick.\nGoal 6 & 7: OOPS – this was the big old one that required FOCUS . Start making Christmas stock of stained glass goodies by August including two new bespoke designs. Are we there yet? Oh shit its mid October.\nGoal 8: Commissions – well I have done the preliminary drawings for 3, that was my target, but none of them, to date have resulted in any glass being cut….however, i remain optimistic for this one\nGoal 9: Run retreats: Nope. This one involves the coordination and cooperation of Hubby and we’re just not that organised together. Maybe 2018.\nGoal 10: YEAH – if you read the interim report in May you know I’ve got an exhibition pending!!! My first EVER solo exhibition. I actually visited the exhibition space yesterday and spoke to the curator. So now I’ve paced it out and I know exactly how many pieces of work i need (15) and how many I have ready (13). Well, 12. Actually 11.5… the point is, I’m (almost) on track and most importantly I have some friends who want to sort out the private viewing and promotion for me , so that means there’ll be prosecco and CAKE.\nGoal 11. Facebook: I’ve been pretty proactive here. I split myself in two. There is now a page @CerdynvillaBandB for all things relating to life at the guesthouse and tourism related snippets; and there’s @BerniGlassArt for all things arty and crafty, including news on my own imminent exhibition and any classes I might be teaching…. I’ve even included a shop….. Between the 2 there are 1000 followers but again its interaction that’s needed and i have no idea how to improve that (don’t worry, I’m going to book a course!)\nGoal 12: Vlogging…well. Errr. Um… I’m going to blame technology. No? Ok I’ll blame my relationship with my technology. I guess that won’t wash either. I will get on with it. Promise. Sorry Dinah. #hangsheadinshameandgoestositonthenaughtystep\nSo that’s how I’m doing against my overall targets. I’m going to pat myself on the back, because I’m pretty happy with what I have done and I promised myself I would focus on what I had done rather than what I hadn’t. I also have to remember all the other things I have done that weren’t on the list like;\n- Joined and started using Instagram and Pintrest (again, I’m booking a course as I have no idea whats going on really!)\n- Busy season in the B&B – more new and loads of repeat visitors\n- Massive stained glass community project (Jan – June)\n- Several regular gardening jobs\n- Extra work for my friends who run a caffi\n- fitted in a little mini break to Rome\n- Family wedding\n- New grandson\nand there are still two and a half months to go…..\nhow are you getting on with your annual targets, if you have them?\nWell done! You’d achieved so much, you should be very chuffed with yourself!\nMy goals and targets are perpetually moving, but I don’t feel like I’m doing too badly – it’s very much ‘at my own pace’ ha ha! Xx\nLikeLike\nNo wonder you needed a bit of a break to Rome. A hug from us for your achievements and hopefully we shall see you in May if not before. I will send you the dates’ xxx\nLikeLike",

It is a proposal on which we are yet to decide and you can make your suggestion in the poll at the end of this blog…\nAll the main Parties have been holding their annual conferences and for the Loonies it was no exception, theirs (ours) was however, as you might expect, a tad more exceptional!\nThe first National party conference to be held in Wales , The Monster Raving Loony Party chose its Radnorshire H/Q of the Ridgebourne Inn in Llandrindod as its host for this, its 30th.\nSpanning Friday 26th – Sunday 28th September, this years conference was organised by their Radnorshire candidate, Lord Offa of the Dykes (AKA Chris Rogers of HabitFormed Records, Llandrindod). The party don’t like anyone to miss out so select a different venue every year ensuring followers from all over the UK get a chance to have their say.\nThe late Sir Patrick Moore quite rightly pointed out the Monster Raving Loony Party had an advantage over all the other parties, in that they knew they were loonies. How insightful!\nThis year the conference did not disappoint. I can’t say it was the best , as it’s the first I’ve attended, but I can say it was momentous, surreal and exactly as outrageous as I’d expected\nMembers and supporters from around the UK joined the conference which included a Leaders Address from long-standing (15 years) and uncontested party leader Howling Laud Hope (Alan Hope); a full cabinet reshuffle (cabinet obtained from local charity shop for the princely sum of £15 British Pounds); a meet and greet town walk (Pub Crawl) which took in every hostelry in Llandrindod plus opportunities to experience the party’s parties and meet/join discuss points of interest (Party piss up).\nAlan reminded us of 3 bi-elections in which OMRLP stood this year, plus the fact that in its 30 years and between its 28 candidates not one, to date, has ever retained his/her deposit! He also pointed out that in May, if we have enough candidates standing in Wales – and it looks like we will, we too will be entitled to a Party Political Broadcast… watch this space.\nAnyway; there was a good turnout; I was there as my alter-ego,Lady lily of the Pink; in recognition of the affinity the Party has to Brecknockshire; Screaming Lord Sutch (David Sutch) played his last ever gig at The Neuadd Arms Hotel (Brecknokshires party H/Q). Also in attendance were some Gower Loonies including their leader,Baron Barns Von ClapTrap (David Barnes), Sir Dangerous Dave (Vice Leader); the Rochdale Loonies, the Manchester Loonies, Lincolnshire, the Gower Loonies, Birmingham, Derbyshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Surrey and Blackpool plus a very strong contingent of various other Welsh members, (including several more from Llanwrtyd – Eccentricity Capital of the World !). And the icing on the brightly sprinkled cake were the B.U.M.S, or Border Urban Morris Side from Monmouthshire.\nThe weekend was full of joviality and music with great sounds from The Big Fibbers (songs including ‘Valerie Singleton Saw Him Naked’ and Chris Heath, AKA “Badaxe” (latest Cd “19 Trax of Utter Shit” on Friday night, with Gripper and the Gurnards featuring BB Black Dogs ‘Dale Rowles’ & Molly along , ‘The Hurricanes’ featuring Zak, OJ and Jason still in their teens, on the Saturday night. Guest musicians also included Georgia Price and Tyler Cuddy as well as great jam sessions both nights until the wee small hours with our friends the BUMS.. Heres a bit of the live music – Tyler, Jason, Zak\nSo Loon, Wannabee Loons, Closet Loons – if you want a Party that knows how to Party , then why not Join The Party…. VOTE FOR INSANITY, YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE\nHow’s about a Giggle of Loonies?\nLikeLike\nI reckon either a Binfull of Loonies o even a skinfull!\nLikeLike\nAn Absurdity of Loonies is pretty good !\nLikeLike\nInvite other suggestions as well !\nLikeLike\nhiya – if you use the voting form there is an ‘Other’ option and it will collate the votes if there are too many for me to count – lol\nLikeLike",

Every single action is a slog, every single tiny request is overwhelming. civility in communication is a struggle.\nI’m sure I’m not unique. I skip along with my multi-faceted life, doing a million and one different jobs, perfectly happily. I juggle an overloaded diary and still enjoy a night out. And then, sometimes, I don’t.\nToday I woke up after a fitful night – too hot, lots of irritating midge bites and a fly buzzing around the room all night. I woke up with a start an hour before I needed to, with a heavy heart and a disturbed gut. And then the day assaulted me. It went from nought to sixty in record time and I could barely breathe from the force of it. Hubby trying to leave to take my car (a classic, 1968 Hillman Husky named Ffloyd) the 13 miles for its MOT only to discover that it had a completely flat battery and needed push starting; B&B guests an hour earlier than expected for breakfast AND at the exact same moment as the car pushing incident; teen son trying to pack and get away for a long road trip in his classic 1965 singer Chamois and all the last-minute questions and requests that involved.\nThis followed an exceptionally busy week. An exceptionally busy diary for the next three weeks. And a phone call from the guys who manages a flat I own near where we used to live saying that the boiler needs replacing…. The “we need £3000 out of thin air by tomorrow” type nightmare that brings you out in a blind panic.\nSo this afternoon I went for a nap. Woke up, felt worse. Not heard from son as no phone signal in my own house and he’s probably not there yet so there’s nothing to be told. Ffloyd did pass his MOT. normally that would have me euphoric.\nRoom changes, last-minute bookings, ironing. This whole summer, rather than seeing us through winter will pay for that bloody boiler , in that bloody flat, that I wish I never bought but can’t sell. I must be the only person with Essex based property that suffers with negative equity. NEVER, listen to those TV programs that tell you its a great deal to buy off plan. Been stuck with this millstone for 12 years now. Its one of those “luxury complexes” that turned out to be a bag of shit; built cheap by cowboys and has suffered from fire, flood and plague of locusts (well cockroaches…and no I am not making it up), in the years I’ve had it; never mind destructive tenants; illegal immigrants and enforcement officers battering down the doors (at my expense). I could go on; but I can feel myself building to a crescendo of self destruct.\nToday I’ve shouted, and shed tears.\nTomorrow is another day. May my more positive and happy-go-lucky normality resume. In the meantime, today can go poke it.\nHey Berni,\nWe all have those days. They suck and are the type of days when you want to shut down and put up a sign saying “fornicate off”.\nA wise woman once said to me, that the blogging community will always be there with a little like or a wordy waffle of support.\nI know I’m late, story of my life! But it might make you smile next time you are having one of those days.\nPaul\nLikeLike\nA hug from me. xxx\nLikeLike",

In fact its ‘politician speak’ or ‘marketing speak’ or ‘spin’. It’s a statement of fact . You COULD build a hospital for £350Mil (true ? I don’t know the cost of building a hospital – i suspect it depends on size, location, facilities etc), its possible. It’s a statement. It’s not a promise to do so.\nMarketeers always use statistics and empty statements to sound knowledgeable, supportable, better than the rest. It’s a sales pitch. ……\n“…up to 99% improvement…”.\nThe advert probably won’t say 100% because we consumers might not believe that shit.; but 99% improvement, that’s what they hope we’ll hear. According to sales figures that’s what many people will hear. “wow if I use that shampoo my hair will be 99% softer”.\nWhat does it really mean? It means nothing. “Up to”, could be 1%, 12%, 87%; anything really. It could mean no improvement at all!. It’s not a “LIE”, it is in fact a ‘TRUTH” but it doesn’t give you anything.\n£350Mil is (probably) enough to build a new hospital; no-one actually said they would.\nI remember David Cameron stating in a speech how sad it would make him if he had to do something (cut some benefit or other), I forget exactly which cut saddened him. What he didn’t say is that he wouldn’t cut it. Once voted in he did cut it. Did he lie? Technically he didn’t, his spin doctors/script writers worded his speech so he actually promised nothing, he just lead the ‘consumer’ to believe he was on their side……\nDid he lie? I suppose in this instance I might argue that the cut didn’t even make him sad…so maybe he did.",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_12_09_a-year-in-the-life-of/content_1769.html": "Every year, like many of you out there, I compose a ’round robin’ style letter to include with Christmas cards for those friends and relatives we rarely see. With my increased modern communication channels – this blog, facebook etc I tend to send out very few Christmas cards so the RR is predominantly for elderly more distant relatives. I really enjoy pulling it together, consolidating ‘a year in the life of…’ into 2 sides of A4.\nHere’s this years review (with a few added hyperlinks)… I hope you find it entertaining…\nHi ! It’s that time of year again! Where do the months go?\nOn sitting down to write this year’s update to you all, I had to first read last years. It did make me chuckle!\nIt read, “…kitchen remains unfinished”. Hot news. Kitchen STILL remains unfinished!! Although the floor and walls are now done! Its slow progress in this household! Although to be fair John did have his hand operation.\nIf you remember last year I mentioned he was having an operation on his hand on 13th December. It was a huge success, a pyro-carbon insert into his thumb joint which has given him back full mobility and eradicated the pain. It did however take much much longer than the suggested 6 weeks to regain full strength and movement.\nThe bathroom however IS (finally) finished and, as mentioned, i did create a NASA inspired stained glass window. My version of a whirlpool galaxy.\nI also spotted the paragraph “…the very talented and handsome Graham Crompton took away my weather-worn Hillman Husky and agreed to restore her ….”. Like father like son, she finally came home looking amazing but ‘not quite finished’ JUST in time for the annual Imp Club National this August!!! As I write now she is still awaiting the fitting of new carpets and a solution for a new headlining but the paint job…wow! The other attribute Graham gets from his father is perfectionism; the paintwork has a mirror finish.\nThe Imp National was fabulous, At scone near Perth, home of the Imp and celebration its 50th birthday. Ffloyd managed the whole 1100 miles with only a few minor hiccups. Sadly it didn’t do so well on the way to the local show. 20 miles into our 40 mile journey to Pandy it had complete electrics failure and we had to arrive there by low loader. At least we were in the right place to get expert help in fixing her.\nA lot has happened for Jason too. Sadly his band “Lindsays Shirt” split up with their last gig at the Brecon Jazz Fringe in August. Lots of reasons but largely relating to GCSE commitments. However, Jason has joined another group. A very talented bunch calling themselves ‘The Hurricanes’. They not only cover great rock n roll classics but also write their own material. They are currently mid-way through the professional recording of a 6 track EP of original works which they intend to send to record companies!!! If you are computer savvy you can follow their progress. Here is the link to their You tube channel:\nThey also have a Facebook page:- https://www.facebook.com/bandnamehurricanes\nHe’s studying for his final year of GCSEs and on schedule for straight A’s. He turned 16 on 9th November and had a wonderful party with a group of lovely teens. He is so lucky to have a wonderful group of supportive friends. We are currently looking at what options he has for A levels with his chosen subjects being Maths, Physics, Music and Geography.\nJust after I wrote last year’s review I made the difficult decision to close my arts and crafts shop, In the Pink. It had been running at a loss for some years – covering its overheads but not paying a salary. John and I had invested the little savings we had and then December presented a 75% fall in takings at the end of an already bad year. It was time to stop. Sad times but the right thing to do.\nIt’s been interesting since. My closing down sale scheduled for a week at the end of January made the local press. I had put a note in the window stating that people who had not supported the business were not welcome to attend the closing down sale! I know, controversial! However, local businesses rely on local support and it’s very annoying when people who never supported you criticise you for closing! The press got wind of the sign my shop window and I made the front page!\nThat wasn’t the only occasion I caused a stir in town this year, standing up against (perceived) inappropriate behaviour within in the Town Council didn’t make me very popular but did get the issue resolved. Not just me but half a dozen of us committed to seeing fairness in the system!\nOur final act of dissidence this year was the ‘traffic light party” orchestrated by our friend Mike Smith to get action in relation to a set of traffic lights that were approaching their 2nd birthday. Cake, banners, silly hats and a press release. We made our point. The outstanding works were completed and the lights removed shortly after. As Wolfie Smith of the Tooting Popular Front used to say, “Power to the People!” – hahaha.\nSo there’s a lot there about what we haven’t done. We haven’t got our shop, we haven’t finished our kitchen, John hasn’t done much DIY work, Jason hasn’t turned into a moody teenager! So what have we been doing? Other than upsetting the local political system!\nWell it’s been a fun and busy year in the B&B as a result of the good summer and mild winter. Lots of lovely new guests as well as a fair number of regulars\nJohn has taken up a hobby that earns him a little on the side. He’s selling on ebay. He ‘finds’ odd things, researches them a then sells them on. The fun being in the discoveries. Including a perfect condition 1948 Formula 1 programme picked up at the local tip! He’s also, in the latter part of the year got back to a spot of Handyman work much to the relief and joy of his fans, the local elder ladies of Llanwrtyd Wells!\nI’ve become a home-based artist/craftworker, although I am still struggling with not having the routine of going off to work. I’ve\nhad a few commissions and attended a few craft fairs as a trader. Its lovely being able to be creative but I do need to work on my time management! We’ve also become fans of the ‘classic’ caravan. I wanted one to convert into a mobile art studio / craft shop with a view to it being light enough to be towed by a 48 year old car with an 875cc engine!! After bidding on several I finally discovered one in a friend’s garden just around the corner and am now the proud owner of a 1967ish Elddis 2 berth which I had intended to have refurbished by now. Oh well-a nice winter project. Also its too heavy to tow with Ffloyd but I then discovered the Rapido Exportmatic Folding Caravan having seen one at Imp 50. I HAD to have one. So now we do! I think we might have to open a caravan park!! I refer you to my blog “Not so Rapido”\nWhat else? Well, I’ve become a blogger.”Rose Tinted Ramblings from a Less Ordinary Life” .Why not take a look (oh you are doing!!!)? For an idea of the peculiarities of life in Mid Wales I suggest you read “Frogs, Bogs and Men in Speedos..!”\nThat’s it for 2013. Hopefully no last minute surprises. I will leave you with my favourite 2013 commission, for John to give his mum, in memory of a most wonderful and generous man.\nWishing you all the joys, delights, love and laughter of your own individual ’less ordinary life’. Much love and happiness for 2014 xxxx",

With only 1% of drivers saying that they would definitely stop to give someone a lift, and only 1% of respondents having hitchhiked in the last year, drivers have given a thumbs down to hitchhiking.\n“The older generation are more likely to have thumbed a lift and hence are more likely to pick up hitchhikers. Perhaps cheaper coach travel, growth in car ownership, online lift sharing sites and personal safety fears have all contributed to the decline in hitchhiking”\nA few weeks ago I picked up a hitchhiker. I didn’t tell anyone I’d done it until about a week later when I mentioned it in passing to a friend.\nThe reaction was one of shock and concern. Wasn’t I afraid? What if he’d been a murderer or rapist? Do I often pick up hikers?!?\nWhen I was in Israel ( nearly 30 years ago) where they have conscription, young solders got around either by bus or hiking. They’d be ‘casual’ whilst in their uniform… shirt hanging out, several top buttons undone, sleeves rolled up, gun slung over their shoulder. They would hitch from bus stops and drivers were obliged to pick up hitching soldiers. As a back packer, I knew that if I wanted a lift all I had to do was hike from a bus stop and I’d get a lift with a soldier. I never thought twice about accepting a lift.\nWhen I got back to the UK I was about 24 and I’d regularly offer hitchhikers lifts. Then a few years on I got caught up in the fear culture and stopped. I felt sad and embarrassed passing someone in the rain but was too nervous to stop.\nSince moving to Wales, I’ve regained my perspective on life! I’ve remembered the majority of people are good. I’ve remembered the joy of helping out a stranger.\nIt felt great last week picking up the lad I did. Turns out his car was written off and so he’d been leaving early and hiking to work.\nI can understand why people these days are both less likely to hitch and less likely to pick up hitchhikers, but I do think it’s a bit sad that it’s disappearing in the UK. I’ll continue to be one of the 12% of people in Wales prepared to pick up a hiker .

Plan was to grab some food and return home – absence of teenager and sheer laziness toward cooking compelled us to the decisive solution, plus possibly the two large glasses of wine I’d knocked back to get over the trauma of herding cats earlier in the afternoon (now, there really is another story).\nWe have just spend the last two hours with a woman who is now my hero. Aged 91 she’d just ordered her third 1/2 of “Big Red Chopper” and was settling down, for the second time, to her vanilla ice-cream having returned it to the kitchen with the demand of more chocolate sauce. Her where-with-all was more with-all than mine by far and her hearing surpassed both Johns and her sons who were repeatedly asking for repeats because of the irritating background noise. She’s just moved to Llanwrtyd after 60yrs in her old home near Sussex.\nOn the 10 minute stroll to the town square (before the great ham, eggs and chips followed by summer berry crumble with custard AND ice-cream and drinking with the lovely Merle) we caught up with our Russian neighbours (chandeliers, bullet proof bank glass windows , distillery in the basement, vodka for breakfast – at least that’s what I hope)) They are the loveliest family and brew the best winberry wine in the world. Dimitri is actively involved in the World Alternative Games -particular area of expertise being Russian Egg Roulette. But this particular evening he was standing astride his breeze block front garden pond, wine glass in hand (apparently, for a change, full of blackberry tea). He is supervising the instillation of an irrigation system on the other side of the road to ensure a bumper crop of blackcurrants for his current (excuse the pun ) entrepreneurial project to produce a special welsh herbal tea , “blackcurrant root fiery dragon tea” . Why the hell not.\nOn return from the pub 5 hours later we notice the irrigation system, namely a hose pipe straight across the road, is effectively installed. I can almost hear the cuttings rooting. It must work , they had , after all, looked into it on Google.\nWe’re looking forward to our first brew.\nNB: this entry was written with love and admiration to our wonderfully eccentric friends and neighbours – no offense is intended or should be taken, you are all my heroes",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_03_30_self-doubt-stress-and-sickness/content_485.html": "Sometimes its possible to just feel ‘not quite right’, not sick as such just ‘out of sorts’ . If , like me, you suffer from anxiety based illnesses it’s possible (I find, as I can only talk from experience), to find it difficult to judge whether you are ‘sick’ or feeling ‘down’ and as such, feel sick. That doesn’t mean that ‘down’ is not a valid sickness, it’s just whether the symptoms derive from the anxiety or from something else like a virus or bug or allegy or something more sinister.\nThis whole week I’ve felt sick. Really tired, thick head, wheezy. I’ve not been sick or rushing to the loo but my stomach is definitely very upset. It gurgles and complains constantly. Its windy and acidy and intolerent of anything it receives (gross, graphic and not particularly lady-like, sorry!). Now I know I have a small hiatus hernia (very common , nothing to worry about), I also know I have to take medication for acid reflux and in the past have been treated for an oesophagal ulcer. I also aware that when I overdo it I ‘fade’. I kind of shut down. I don’t want to go out, I can’t face work and my brain struggles to focus. My head and body feel weighed down and sluggish.\nWhatever the ‘real’ reason, the facts are that my head aches, I’m tired. I’ve slept every afternoon this week and most of yesterday. My stomach is genuinely ‘not right’. But would I feel better if I just got out there and weeded someones garden a bit (as a job not just for the hell of it!); or got out my sketch pad and started producing drawings for the commissions I have waiting; or started cutting glass for a commission already agreed; or did my tax return; or got my head around the catering order for next weeks Sunday lunch… Maybe just the list is too long and I need to breathe and focus…..\n….Or maybe I do really just need to go and have another little lie down\nSo, why do I feel a ‘fraud’ when I feel ‘sick’? I think its because my feelings of wellness and my drive and enthusiasm and focus swing wildly from day to day; sometimes morning to afternoon; and sometimes I know to work through it and I do and its fine. Sometimes I think I know to work through it and I do and its not fine I go into a decline. SOMETIMES I make the descision that its a bug and rest and then wonder if I’d feel better if I just got on with it and the slouching around is a catalyst for feeling more ‘sick’.\nSo the question is, is it just me or is it you too? Do you worry about these things? When do you know it’s ‘sick’ and time to see a doctor, or ‘sick’ and recognising the need to slow down? Or ‘sick’ and you just need to give yourself a good kick up the backside?\nHi Berni,\nI love your blogs and your honesty. Thank you for bringing up another tricky topic and helping us all talk about it. And by the way, it certainly isn’t just you!\nI have always been aware that I have to be careful not to spiral downwards when I feel this coming on.\nThe way I’ve developed to cope with it, is to stop asking myself what is causing me to feel a certain way or making my body do a certain thing. For example, I dislocate easily. I spent many years looking for causes, trying to cut-out anything that might bring on more dislocations. The result was that I gave up doing lots of things I loved and never made any difference to the number of dislocations I had (and still have).\nI found this was also the case with my anxiety; a perfect example was last week when we were due to go to the first concert I’d booked tickets for in over 5 years and, yes, you know it – I had a serious case of anxiety. Being in a crowded space used to be one of my favourite things, but since my heart surgery, I dread it – to the point that I’d rather eat rice pudding than go to an event with more than 4 people (and trust me the very thought of rice pudding makes me feel queezy!) So when I started to have hot flushes, a cough, even the shivers, I knew straight away what was happening. I knew I wasn’t “ill” as you put it.\nBut I also know something else, and I’d love you to apply it too. I know that I am the one who gets to say “This is too much” or “I just don’t like how I feel about this” and that I can do this without judgement. There is no right or wrong definition of “ill”. Allow yourself to decide “this one is me needing some time to chill/have a duvet day/cry/eat chocolate” and go with it.\nAnd add one more thing to that list – call a friend.\nlove from me to you xx\nLikeLike",

An irrational thread of worry that you will find me pathetic. A big dollop of feeling like a fraud.\nI have this battle going on in my head ( imagine that image in movies with the saint and the devil on each shoulder whispering conflicting messages into your ears).\nI’m knackered. Totally and utterly drained of energy. My head is trying to formulate action my body is in total all out protest fight. I am not functioning.\nOver the last week my body has ached more and more. My brain has fought against my body harder and harder. Today my body is on strike, a barrier has been built between my mind and muscles and my head hurts from bashing itself against it.\nI’ve turned to mush. I managed to get up and serve my guests breakfast with all the energy, smiling and chatting that goes with that. I had some breakfast and argued with my body to prepare for action. It’s the most glorious day. I have 5 outstanding gardening jobs to do. I’d rescheduled 2 for today and 3 for tomorrow.\nThe only thing my body would do was lay down. The only thing my mind would do was switch off. I lost my gorgeous sunny morning to sleep. Asked hubby to wake me around noon… It was an impossible task. I dragged myself downstairs at two. Microwaved the cup of tea he’d brought me two hours earlier. I sat on the front door step hoping the gorgeous day would energise me…. I fell asleep with my head against the door frame.\nI’m not ill. I shouldn’t be exhausted. Yes, I do a lot but I don’t really put in full days like I did when working for the man. I love my life and the closet of hats it comes with.\nI do see a pattern. Note my post “life: mine:it’s full: .. Shortly after I get to the euphoric with life point; the feeling of reaching a perfect balance. Shortly after exalting the joy and contentment I feel to my world, I run out of fuel and fall into decline.\nWriting my last blog ( “life, mine..”) it was after our quiet season and into the growth and rebirth of the next. Spring had sprung. Guests were booking into our B&B; gardens needed tending; buds were forming on the trees and bushes; all those tender fluorescent green shoots dancing in warm breezes . Snowdrops, crocuses and daffodils; Camellia, forsythia and grape hyacinths splashed colour onto life’s canvas and everything, including me, felt so alive and vital. And then there was overload.\nThe week that included Easter was beyond busy. So many hats to wear at the same time. They were too heavy. “But hey,” thought I, “Get through the week and then rest”. But the next week was even busier….. “I can do this”, I thought. Most of the demands were things I love to do: glass, cafe, guests, gardening. However there were what felt like a zillion other little things that needed to be done too. Tiny jobs: organise an electrician; message tenants; collect my new glasses; shop for food; make veggie sausages; meet up with friends; buy a birthday gift.\nMy body started to protest. Everything ached. Then it ached more. My brain failed to send messages to the right parts of my body. It took 40 minutes mid-week to persuade my body to get off a chair and walk back to the car to drive home. At the traffic lights I had to battle with my eyes not to close and just have a little cat nap.\nToday I’ve just slept. I’m sure I feel worse for it. Not only are guilt and shame raging through me. Also totally embarrassment and a sense of patheticness. Then panic. I have so much to do. The weather is perfect to do it. I would really enjoy doing it too. The customers would be so happy too, I love visiting these elderly ladies and chatting whilst gardening. But I’ve done nothing. Not even told the customers… I know this makes it worse but I just can’t, I’m just not there. The party I should be at tonight, I just can’t go. I know I can’t persuade my body to put on clothes and go out, it just will not cooperate. Hubby will have to phone, I’m too ashamed.\nI’m going to stop now before i go on about how much stronger, stable, capable everyone i know is; how much more everyone I admire does etc etc… I know its a short phase rest will resolve. So, despite my guilt I’m going to search out a sun lounger and go and snooze in the garden. Will battle the guilt later xxx\nMissed you babes, but never feel guilty, i love spending time in your company but respect your feelings and ive been ther too. Remember im here when you want to dance but im also here when you want to cry xxxxxxx\nLikeLike\nI’ve been there. Still go there. Have you had a blood test? I was prescribed iron as I’m anaemic and it does help with the drowsiness, at least xxx\nLikeLike\nTrying to get my thyroid level right. plus peri-menapausal. Am sure neither help. I think i expect too much of myself too. So frustrating xxxxxx will get my iron levels checked , thanks for the suggestion x\nLikeLike\nYou don’t need to feel guilty about anything. I’m not surprised by you current state, body and mind. You do too much! Just remember, you’re allowed to say no. Rest now and get off that merry-go-round. All will be well xxx\nLikeLike\nits hard not to feel guilty when you have to let someone down. plus had not to get stressed about it because it just gets added to the backlog… but trying my best – splept all day yesterday. Did one of my gardening jobs today\nLikeLike\nBernie, it’s all a lie. No-one else actually copes better than you – they just lie about it. On a good day you do a gazillion times more than I ever do even on my best days. That feeling you’re describing, in our family we call it lead-bum, because we can’t get our bums off the sofa. I’m sorry you’re having a day like this today… but it truly is nothing to be ashamed about…\nLikeLike\nthank you. I guess i’m used to running around juggling loads of things and accepting there are times when i can’t do that these days is really hard to accept – plus learning to read the signs before i crash and burn ..\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

Unfortunately this is also true of my ‘business head’. Until I moved to Wales and got in touch with my ‘creative side’ I played the whole 9-5 game. As a self-employed Artisan (as I now am) I really need to start thinking about Christmas at the beginning of October (latest), whereas in my ‘past life’ I refused to consider it until after my birthday (which is 19th November and honestly this post is not a hint for birthday wishes…..)\nAnyway, this year I have gotten a little better, I started thinking about it on 8th November (only a month late right?). Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your view-point), we actually have a winter sun holiday booked for a week in December pre-Christmas, so my “business window of opportunity” has shrunk at the other end too. I only made that realisation yesterday as I updated my Etsy shop with Christmas stock.\nNeedless to say I’m a rubbish business manager but am an excellent free-spirit and hedonist!!!\nI do however have a small window of time in which to offer anyone interested a commissioned stained glass trinket or an item from my collection …\nI’m currently up in the middle of the night cutting out robins, blue tits and holly. Ok, to be honest as its so blatantly obvious, I’m blogging about cutting out robins, blue tits and holly, but as soon as I stop typing, I promise you I’ll be right back at it…\nLove the outfit!

There are 8 constituencies in each of the 5 regions. Pretty much nothing changed. Well one thing. The Rhondda, previously a Labour seat was won by Plaid, Leanne Wood . Other than that the status quo remained:\nConstituencies\nLabour 27 , Plaid 6, Conservative 6 Lib Dem 1\nThese are won by a First Past the Post System, that is the Party individual with the most votes (not necessarily a majority) wins the seat. All other votes go unrepresented\nLabour 34.7% of the vote, Plaid 20.5%, Conservative 21.1%, UKIP 12.5% LibDem 2.9% Green 2.3%\nWith FPTP system, if we only had constituency seats, UKIP get no representation despite 12.5% of the electorate wanting them\nIn Wales we attempt to even out the wishes of the electorate by having an additional 20 seats – 4 seats for each of the 5 regions. These are calculated by proportional representation… number of votes divided by 1+ number of constituency seats occupied per region. It means that parties that get substantial votes but not quite enough to win constituency seats get representation for their electorate\nThe main changes in the structure of the Welsh Assembly seats took place here with Conservatives losing 3 and Libdem losing 4 all to UKIP\nLabour 2,Plaid 6, Conservative 5, UKIP 7, Libdem 0\nThese Regional seats were on the very length ballot paper and each party had a list of candidates against them… of course all those candidates can’t sit on the seat so the 1st name of the list takes the post if the seat is won.\nThe total representation for Welsh Assembly is now\nLabour 29, Plaid 12, Conservative 11, UKIP 7, Libdem 1, much more representative of the electorate (whether we like it or not!)\nThe sad fact remains that the turn out averaged only 45.3% (unbelievably this is an improvement on the 2011 where the turnout was 42%)….The Constituencies that showed the best turnouts were Cardiff North and Brecon & Radnor at 57% ( I like to think that maybe, just maybe my campaigning helped a little here, that was my raison d’être)\nSo why the disinterest/apathy/disillusionment ?\nWhat do we (or rather the Government) need to do to engage the 54.7% of the electorate who didn’t think it worth bothering? I think its tragic. THe only wasted vote is one not made. Change is slow. How do we engage the electorate?\nWhat do you think?\nEle",

When I’m working I often listen to TED and I listen to all sorts of speakers on all sorts of subjects.\nI believe strongly that morality is part of humanity not a state reserved for the religious. I believe strongly in the innate goodness of people and I believe in the evidence presented by science for the evolution of life and variation of species.\nI also believe that people only have the right to believe in whatever they like when it does not harm others. I also see a huge basic flaw in religious fanaticism (when and where it occurs) that makes followers believe that ‘their God’ needs defending, protecting or policing to the point where they have to kill/maim or convert non-believers. Surely if these people believe in ‘their God’ and the group of abstract practices and cultural behaviours that enable them to demonstrate that belief, then they should also have faith that ‘their God’ is powerful enough and robust enough to deliver its or his/her own punishment or forgiveness (or whatever) on those who fail to believe and follow the appropriate practices. Surely these ‘all powerful, all-seeing God(s) are not so frail or upset by the offense of the none believer that they ned a mere human to defend them?\nAll religious groups seem to have fanatics; Christian missionaries who go to ‘uneducated’ tribes and convert or kill those who won’t be ‘saved’ or agree to believe in ‘their god’ ; suicide bombers. These fanatics work to ‘protect’ the reputation of ‘their god’ or to ‘save’ those who believe in a different god or different set of rules of behaviour relating to the same god.\nIf their were one true God then surely the majority of people with devout and uncompromising belief have it wrong and will burn in whatever form of Hell and damnation the correct god has as its counterpart.\nI know this is a controversial blog and will upset many people. Theists mainly. But I put it to you theists. If your god is the ‘real God’ then he will deal with me as he sees fit in this life or in the next one (that you believe I will eventually transcend to). I can understand that you may fear for my well-being as a non believer but I see no need for you to take offense or to be intimidated my me; I have no need to try to ‘save’ you from your misguided notions (and as you have a strong faith would in any instance be unable to do so). I also have a strong moral code by which I love, treat others how you would like to be treated yourself, be kind, considerate, work hard, be thoughtful and compassionate, offer help to those less fortunate etc etc.\nI also can understand that you may wish to try to ‘save’ me. Although I would remind you that for some of you, your God is a forgiving God (and thus will see me straight, consider my actions in life and ensure I am forgiven himself).\nI end with this quote that I heard spoken by a great orator and philosopher, Richard Dawkin (it’s not his in origin but I don’t know rightly who first said it). I quote it because it put all the current Gods and faiths into perspective , because over the generations these gods and faiths have altered (does that mean that all our ancestors were wrong and are all in hell?)\n“We are all atheists about most gods that humanity has ever believed in, some of us go just one god further”\nHere’s one of my favourite talks by Philosopher Stephen Cave (I know I also posted it in my Blog “Life’s a Book” , but it is a good one)\nHi again 🙂\nRichard Dawkins “a great orator and philosopher”!! Great orator I’d give you. Philosophy, however, must be a subject he is most ignorant of. He has said it shouldn’t even be considered a serious subject. Many would agree. Few would regard him as “great” in regard to it though.\nA Christian quite rightly in my opinion, referred to him as an atheist version of Ray Comfort, or the “banana proves intelligent design” stable of thought. Which is amusing as well as painfully accurate 🙂\nRegarding the rest of your post.. you seem to come across a lot of theists with seriously ill intent! My motivation for talking to anyone about my faith is out of genuine love that I believe they could benefit from. I don’t believe that sharing love can do any harm. I know what you say has some truth to it, and many who call themselves religious seem to be motivated by hate, which would self destruct any belief based upon a viable creator (who’s nature, if destructive, would destroy rather than create – you see my point).\nSuffice to say, I would agree with your attitude in the face of such irrational hostility. But then I feel aggrieved to be lumped together with them.\nRegarding your own saved state 🙂 it would be my understanding that you rail against the truth that is within you. What harm is there in addressing that? Fair enough if you don’t want to talk about it. Not fair enough if you then judge me for not wanting to share something with you that could turn your life around for the better.\nTo end likewise…\nIn my understanding, all endeavours to understand the divine point to the same truth. 😉\nPeace & love\nLikeLike\nThank you again for your response. I don’t need saving, I o not have to find salvation. i trust in science , empathy, honesty and treating others as I would like to be treated myself. I am happy to explore and live life to the full here in the knowledge that it is my one opportunity to do enjoy the wonders that have evolved on this lump of rock in the infinite solar sustem and beyond. I do not fear death or worry that I will go on to another life of damnation or heavenly eternality… I am happy to accept this world as the beginning and end o my consscious existence. Energy is eternal it is neither created nor destroyed. By body will decompose and feed new life as plants, which will feed animals and help new humans to grow, that is the cycle of life and death and I am very happy with it\nMay you continue find peace and happiness in your God and your life in the ways that make sense to you\nLikeLike\nOf course you need saving silly! 🙂\nYou need truth, and solid reasoning to make sense of the world.\nPhilosophically, a non theistic world view makes no sense at all. You cannot make sense of science for example without borrowing from a theistic world view.\nFor a detailed explanation of this, look at this video on the subject. The bit you’d be interested in starts at about 3:18.\nNote: I’m not in the business of spamming strangers with YouTube links. I never speak of my faith unless challenged to. Your blog post drove me to it! Plus, this is an intellectual, rather than ‘religious’ challenge.\nTake care\nM\nLikeLike\nIf philosophers are expressing your opinions and thoughts then they are not philosophers.\nIt is the purpose of the philosopher to always ask the questions that irritate most.\nThe modern philosopher is consequently nothing more than a Marxist expressing leftist propaganda.\nThat ancient Greek philosophers called such posers, “sophists.”\nLikeLike\nThank you for taking time to comment on my blog – i love this method of communicating with new people plus sophist is not a word I knew and I do like to learn something every day:\nHowever, philosophers surely had followers who agreed or related to their argument/view point – i would suggest. that sophists who discuss the non-existence of god are indeed ‘irritating’ at best.\nLikeLike\nI enjoy your post and the flow of your words. (Although I’m not sure if the whole thing is one big post? Last sentence sort of messed with my head)\nOther than a few grammar errors, the only critical thought I can add is “what is the solution?” (You?) write about the problems with religion, but you never provide a solution?\nIn closing, don’t just whine. It turns people off. Whine a little, then be constructive. 🙂\nLikeLike\nthanks (i think 😉 ) for taking the time to read and comment on my blog. I’ve just started looking at yours and am enjoying it very much. I shall follow you I think 🙂\nMy end link, the Stephen Cave one, was a little self indulgent, because I love it. However I do think it helps explain the potential origins of religions as a form of comfort..\nOn the other point of whining , I didn’t write it in a whiny way, (I don’t think) I know that when I write it is with an attempt to carry across your emotion, mood, tone I am feeling. Which was, at the time, largely upbeat and comfortable with my own beliefs. Basically I have no issue with anyone believing anything as long as they don’t feel the need to hurt anyone else or obstruct scientific development in the process. The fact is I don’t even think religion on the whole is a problem, generally I see it simply as pointless and a form of denial, although perhaps not if it gives comfort or alleviates fear. A bit like the tooth fairy comforting a child when they have a wobbly tooth.\nAnyway, thanks again and good to meet you here in the cyber world.\nLikeLike\nOk, that explains everything much better! I was wondering if the entire post was a quote from Stephen Cave, but I know now it was from you. 🙂\n(sorry, I can be unclear at times. Especially when commenting via phone)\nYou explain your views very well and have earned a follower. Thanks and yes, good to meet someone who cares in this cyber world. Maybe we can dual a post sometime. (I am a heavy apologist for the Christian faith.)\nLikeLike\nError in my comment..\n**(…not sure if the whole thing is one big quote…)\nLikeLike",

I know, surprising for the driver to make themselves sick, but I do. Another of my many ‘quirks’. But I think todays feeling of sickness was something more.

I concentrate on releasing the grip and notice I also have a white knuckle tight grasp of the steering wheel. I loose my grips.\nBreathe\nRelax\nIn two, three, four. Out six, seven, eight.\nFocus on the road. Focus on each breath.\nThe Archers theme tune starts . I reach over and turn off the radio. I round the bend and pull over.\nBefore the Archers; the mindless babble; was a news spot. Before the tension, was Virginia Wolfe.\nTo bomb or not to bomb? Today. the big debate. The big vote. My mental and physical demeanor is a reaction to our political and economic climate. A panic attack. To vote or to veto. To panic AND attack or to rise above and respond? Will our politicians represent ME?\nAcross all parties, they all get a vote. One moment of their time. A tick or a cross. To bomb or not to bomb.\nA leading party that is failing me. Who represent almost nothing I hold dear. Who charges for further education; who wants to frack our national parks; sell off our NHS; fine our homeless; penalise our poor; go to war….\nThis nay/yay vote that will affect all our lives. This group of disassociated individuals. This collective of egos. Career politicians who’ve never experienced ‘ordinary’ lives.\nThey are a body of minds. But do they mind? Will they mind? What is on their individual minds. Will they , with their individual votes, represent me? Or will they take our children; our brothers and sisters; our husbands and wives and hurtle us into a state of war? Or will they; for one moment; one most important moment, think beyond the moment and consider the future. Our future.\nMy mind and body were in a panic. with my whole being I add my voice to those who are like-minded and will THEM to hear US.\nVote NO. NO to bombing. No to warring. No to destroying. NO NO NO.",

Any ‘normal’ individual would probably replace it with a nearly new second-hand something or other.\nNot me. Having been stung before I did not want to risk choosing another duffer and spending the next few months/years forking out for replacement, expensive this and that’s and paying someone else to fit them just because modern cars are so un-mechanic friendly. What with this and the ‘I told you so’ and ‘sodding car’ arguments that in the past had nearly destroyed an otherwise long and happy relationship, the thought of having to choose something began to bring on sleepless nights.\nSo the idea came about to look in the Imp Club magazines, ‘just to see’. Which I did and I did just see. But why would I want to see if I could see a Hillman? Well, for one, John is an avid Hillman fan. John owns an Imp (that yellow one without a roof, his ‘work in progress’); he smiles when things fail and he has to fix them! Johns two eldest sons own(ed) Imps. They too smile when they have to lie on the cold concrete, drop out the engine and replace every part. Again.\nSo I saw something in The Mag, a Husky, right model, right price, right condition, right timing. One week before the Imp Club Do of 2001, so an ideal opportunity to view it with the experts, John, David and Graham – my team of mechanics. Well all those ‘rights’ had to make it the right car. I saw it and had to have it. Obviously.\nBringing it home from Uxbridge to Southend a couple of weeks later was more than a minor challenge. I had never driven a Hillman anything before. John’s had a ‘technique’ that made him the only driver of his. So being a novice both to Hillmans and old cars in general I had never heard of or experienced the need for left foot braking. I stalled at every junction and roundabout. It was a very long journey. But by the time I got it home I too was smiling!\nSo here I was the proud owner of a dark navy Husky with light blue interior, UGW 617F. A middle-aged mum, working in a middle management job, a child in private school. Surely a 4×4 would have been more appropriate. Not content to be just different and not planning to set up a pet funeral service with my new mini hearse (as it was frequently described), I decided I needed a plan. And my plan was pink, but if it was to be pink it had to be PINK!\nWell, you’ve all seen it and know I don’t do things by half!\nObviously, John was very happy to oblige. How could he resist such an opportunity to spend a huge amount of time playing with cars and compressors and not have me moaning about him being in the garage! John, indeed, was a man in his element, a pig in brown stuff, a child in a sweetie shop if you get my drift. He was so happy that he had the seats re-upholstered for my Christmas present in just the right shade of……. you guessed it… PINK.\nThe project took a long time, despite the enthusiasm. Children, building work, day jobs all attempted and managed to get in the way. Also knowing that I couldn’t make the 2002 event took the pressure off and delayed the work. However, Spring 2003 brought with it new vigour (or should I say mass panic!) The job had to be finished. The Wirral was calling. John took on the external duties, sanding, spraying, sanding, spraying, buffing, polishing as well as full service and rebuilds for both my engine and his in time for the long journey. Jason, our youngest, then 5 and I were in charge of interiors. All the metal was painted with little pots of ‘Hot Pink’. The door panels were recovered in black fleece. The carpet was replaced with a grey off-cut. Have any of you ever tried laying a carpet? In a confined space with no straight or flat edges? Not the easiest thing I’d ever done I can tell you. But I had Jason to kneel in the middle column or press his feet against one wheel arch whilst I pressed it down on another. He spread the glue, flattened the carpet and kept me entertained for 2 days inside the car! Then came the roof liner, cream fleece, the obvious choice(!) Ever tried it? Again a challenge, the width changes from front to back, it curves, its above your head! Again my secret weapon came to the rescue holding up one side with his head as I smoothed it across to the other. See, at five and three-quarters he has just the right height to stand with his head against the roof. I could not have done it without him.\nThe fun I have driving it. The people I’ve spoken to and the children and adults who delight in it. I love that everyone recognises me around the place. Mind you, I could never have an affair! Perhaps that’s why John agreed so readily?! Surely not!",

Its a bit heavy, but its heart-felt and it has a happy ending. If you are still curious then read on………..\nSadly, my mum and I have never had that special mum and daughter relationship I envy when i hear girls talk about sharing clothes, exchanging intimate secrets, having girlie nights out together with their mothers. I have to confess, and I’m sure my mum won’t argue with this, and say that our relationship has at times been distant,difficult and even resentful.\nI don’t know why, and I hope my own wonderful mother won’t be offended by these ramblings. This blog for me is an apology, a cathartic clearing of the soul and an awakening to a new chapter. I hope.\nI remember myself as a difficult teenager. not in the unruly – drink, drugs, truancy type of way. I was an exemplary student, didn’t do drugs and didn’t start dating until I was late 15/early 16. I was difficult in that I put up a barrier resulting in a dis-harmonising stand-off between myself and my mum. constantly rowing, driving her to tears, hating myself. Who knows the real reason why. We could blame a long difficult puberty. Possibly didn’t help. But my mum didn’t deserve the disrespect I showed her.\nI didn’t find growing up easy. i remember at junior school being the odd one out as the only child who needed glasses, I felt ugly and geeky and remember pretending not to have them at first and getting into trouble when parents and school communicated on the subject (yes schools did that then!). And then I always had problems with my skin, initially eczema but then all sorts of mysterious problems which I now after years of research, counseling and talk therapy, can put down to anxiety,stress, OCD coping behaviours. I still have these problems, largely now as a result of habit and anxiety. However back then they served to make me the odd one out at school. Always taking time off to visit specialists, taking medication, coating myself in creams, being prodded and poked and used as a guinea pig for medical students. Sunbed therapy (what I’d give for that now!!! – But at the time i didn’t want to be the only kid with a tan); thick VEIL makeup.\nCoupled with moving schools mid years for dads work I grew up being bullied, having nightmares and feeling outcast . i guess I took it out on my mum. She was easy bait. She was always there, for one. I could drive her to tears. She always forgave me.\nAnyway, all of that may be a shock. A bit of baring my soul, laying the ghosts to rest. A bit raw and honest maybe. i’ve discovered however, that it takes years and experiences in ones own life to realise the truths in ones past and lay rest the tormented moments in ones heart and mind.\nFor me, raising my own son, building and sustaining a loving relationship, overcoming my fears and facing my demons has enabled me, finally, to appreciate my great parents.\nParenthood doesn’t come with a manual. There’s no right way . And it comes hand in hand with a lifetime of guilt and worry. Its all a learning curve. Its about making every decision with the best intentions. Even if they turn out to be the wrong ones. If you can look back and know you did that, then you are a good parent.\nMy parents are great parents. They’ve survived everything life has thrown them and stayed together, and are still happy. They dealt with poverty, religious divides, their own childhood ghosts, moving homes for work, deaths of pets, sick kids, ill health. They got us through everything. We both grew up with loving parents , in a stable home, had a good education, learned good moral values, how to communicate, how to be independent, when to ask for help, how to love. What more can you ask of a parent.\nAnd finally, this year, many many decades too late, I finally realised and was able to express how much my mum means to me. Last weekend we had our first girlie weekend away together. We booked 2 nights, twin room in a nice hotel in Cardiff. We talked a bit, ate in nice restaurants, had foot spas, shopped. We had a good time. It was really really great. I think we will do it again, hopefully soon.\nMum, to the world, you need to know I love you.",

But time for timeliness was lost to busy-ness and busy-ness was loss to craziness and a certain amount of chaotic-ness, sleeplessness and general tiredness!\nIt was a whirlwind summer, one that promised to be longer than most (which it was) but to fit in the extra length, time was most certainly speeded up and the resultant rapidity of activity, organisation and enjoyable experiences blurred into one mass of euphoria and exuberance.\nI wanted to write to you about all the gardens I visited.\nThe vibrant and magestic Bicton Park Botanical Gardens, near Exeter:-\nThe tranquil and contemplative Burrow Farm Gardens in Axminster:-\n…and the hidden gem of Hergest Croft, in Kington, Herefordshire; with its perfect little tea room and plant nursery\nI wanted to wax lyrical about the wonderfully wacky two weeks of the World Alternative Games culminating in commentating for the World Bog Snorkelling here in Llanwrtyd Wells.\nI wanted, but failed, to fit in participating in any of the adventures of the fortnight – although I wanted to Office Chair Race, Husband Drag, Ditch Run, Pea Shoot, Crazy Shop, Worm Charm, Race Chariots, Wrestle in Gravy, Run Backwards, Cycle Slowly and dress as a Zombie; but the extra activities in town meant extra work for me .\nThen there was the fabulous Imp Club National event at Hatton Park World in Warwickshire which involved camping; cars; a rally to the British Motor Museum in Gaydon (fabulous thoroughly recommend it); and strolls along the Grand Union Canal tow path.\nMeanwhile there was still work. I was busy managing five other people’s garden’s ( I love these jobs). I had my own house than needed painting and some extra shifts in our local caffi. Mum and Dad wanted (and did) visit. Our B&B proved extra popular this summer with both new and repeat visitors. fitting in a hectic self employment based multitude of work activities alongside a heavy social schedule has been both incredibly exhilarating and exhausting in equal measure. There are people I love who I have not seen or spoken to in the last 8 weeks…. forgive me until October, I will be back. …and events i didn’t fit in (sadly) especially the Pink Car Rally which is fabulous fun and for a great cause… next year….\nAnd then I wanted to share with you all the fun of our long planned , end of summer party where we dressed the entire garden as an enchanted landscape themed for Alice in Wonderland; complete with appearing and disappearing Cheshire cat grins; card guards, tea party and lawn croquet….\nI was seriously keen to play the Proud Mum and rave about the excellent achievements of my son and his friends who all sat in nervous anticipation of their A level results until they could finally relax and revel in their exceptional successes this summer – how proud am I to know them all.\nI was determined to discuss with you the trials and tribulations; nerves and nausea caused to these teens in the preparing and planning for their next chapter… for many it’s this weeks move into their university halls. Sick with excitement, doubt, fear and anticipation; worry about making new friends; living away from home; learning in a new way; taking responsibility for their own finances. I drop Jason at his halls tomorrow. As I type this (or in between paragraphs ) I’m preparing his ‘final supper’; his favourite meal; one he feels he’s unlikely to ever eat again…. well, at least until he comes home for his dad’s 60th; or the Christmas holidays… or in fact any weekend or weekday evening he wishes!!!! So it’s Thursday and I’m preparing a Sunday roast with all the trimmings and my mum’s very indulgent rice pudding recipe. I sense a heart warming afternoon, playing board-games, having a good old laugh and possibly a few tears (mainly mine); probably a sleepless night and then tomorrow a drive to Cardiff. I plan to be the ‘cool mum’ the one who offers ‘just the right amount’ of support/detachment/emotion/comment… I plan to leave with a hug and a smile and let him get on with it…. we all know what they say about the best laid plans.\nAnyway, this shall begin my last weekend of summer and I plan to write an addendum next week…. stay in touch people… and why not tell me about your summer.\nOne thought on “the end of summer….”",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_07_31_please-dont-bring-me-flowers/content_251.html": "My attitude to cut flowers is funny old thing. After all I love gardening, dead-heading, weeding, pruning. I love seeing the garden in full bloom and I’m aware that some flowers need picking to encourage more flowers to grow. Plus sometimes the rain, wind or our chickens damage a flower stalk so I’ll pick it up and stick it in a vase.\nOn the whole though, I’m not a cut flower person. I mean they look lovely in a vase in someone elses house in full bloom on a visit or in an arrangement at a wedding or on a table in a restaurant. But when I actually have them at home they just make me sad. They arrive at their peak and then you plonk them in water with a bit of food to prolong their life and you just watch them wither and die. Its tragic. Not to mention that in the confines of the house either, and sometimes, both Hubby and I will have an allergic reaction to the scent which is often quite overpowering when indoors.\nI remember sometime back writing about my wishes for end of life. I wasn’t being morbid but I felt I should document the things I feel strongly about. One of my key requests was to have snowdrops, crocuses, and daffodil bulbs buried with me and absolutely no cut flowers. I don’t want my relatives and friends coming back to dead flowers, a bit too much morbid symbolism. But with bulbs they will flower and multiply year on year, and my plot, under what ever tree wherever that will be, will live on and bring joy and colour long after I’m gone.\nfunnily enough i also have a problem with house plants. In a garden I will nurture and tend, water and maintain but the minute a plant is in a pot in my house I look at it with bemusement as it droops or withers. I never remember to water it, or re-pot it or feed it. I’m an indoor plant murderer (remember that should you ever feel inclined to gift me a plant – if it has to live indoors I WILL KILL IT!!! ). It’s a shame really because I actually love orchids but once the initial flowers die off I have absolutely no clue how to tend it to ensure I get new life in future years. I’ve had two sad-looking specimens on top\nof the piano for a year! I kid you not, in fact I am going to provide photographic evidence right now…\nOur garden here at Cerdyn Villa B&B\nI’m with you when it comes to looking after flowers. They are best off growing in the garden via the green fingers of loved ones. I sourced some fake ones from a charity shop that look lovely indoors and I’m considering treating myself to an artificial autumnal bouquet. #BlogCrush\nLikeLike\ni have some artificial flowers indoors and they’re lovely – even i can’t kill them 😉\nLikeLike\nI never really thought of it like that. I love the colour and freshness that flowers bring into your home, but yes it is sad when they die. I think the idea of having bulbs with you is really great – what a lovely legacy to leave. #blogcrush\nLikeLike\nthanks, yes bulbs as a legacy.\nI remember when we moved hereto our home Cerdyn Villa, here in Mid Wales. Ity was the 4th February and at the end of our garden there is a copse of trees – we walked in there and the entire floor was a carpet of snowdrops – I cried. Snowdrops are the most joyful bulb, new life at the beginning of the new year\nLikeLike\nI didn’t used to like cut flowers, but having lived in a first floor flat with no garden for the last decade and a half, I’ve discovered I prefer cut flowers around to having no flowers at all… 🙂\nLikeLike\nI think I’d go crazy if i didn’t have a garden. I never sit in it but i do need to get dirty in it (I mean dig, weed etc!) or just do a once around it to see whats growing…. when i lived in a flat in london i spent much of my none work time in St James Park (i’d find myself weeding there too!!!)\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nI spend a lot of my time in London’s public parks and green spaces too! 🙂\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_10_24_come-on-and-do-the-ron-run/content_175.html": "Last Sunday was the 8th Memorial Half Marathon dedicated to Ron Skilton.To be fair we didn’t know him very well. we moved in Feb 05 and Ron passed away Dec 05 having battled for 6 months with the degeneration and knowledge of having Motor Neurone Disease. What we did know was that he was a kind and generous man. With a gentle demeanor and a good humour. A lovely neighbour. What we have come to know is what a strong and caring family branched out from him. His lovely widow Irene, his brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. We also know how well-respected and loved he was within his community . As a young man he was a keen runner and cyclist. As a professional man he was a well-regarded architect and draftsman. As a member of his community he was inclusive, proactive and integrated. He was the co-founder of Green events, the creator of the ‘Home of Bog Snorkelling’\nWhen Ron died in 2005, the town wanted to remember him. Because of his history of running and cycling and event led tourism the Ron Skilton Half Marathon was set up. It has become a very special annual event.\nIt more than a fund-raising run. i refer you to my last blog about the mutual benefits of charitable giving. Every year since the first in October 2006 this challenging fell run has been the perfect excuse and a catalyst to Ron’s family who meet in Llanwrtyd for a reunion. The number of family members seems to grow year on year. Whilst here they help with the event by Marshaling the course. The entire 13 miles (12.58 miles to be exact) are marshaled by the members of one family. This year there were 26 Skilton’s in town. That has to be unique.\nThe run itself is different from most too and judging by the reviews in Runners World, these differences, together with the warm welcome and challenging course, are much appreciated.\nI’ll tell you a little about it.\nfirstly, its run totally by volunteers – its organised under the Green Events umbrella by Bob Greenough and John Crompton, occasionally with a little help from me. It is marshaled by the Skilton family and it attracts representatives from MNDA. Maimei, the SW Wales Rep comes every year with T-shirts, or running vests , a friendly smile and a couple of collection buckets, which she invariably forgets to rattle!!. It’s by no means a ‘hard sell’ fundraiser\nThe course starts, middles and finishes in the Town Square , outside the Neuadd Arms Hotel. This allows for a figure of 8 style course and 2 person relay teams with minimal logistical challenge. The course is predominantly off-road and on mountains. It spans two local peaks – Spion Kop and The Garn with accents and descents of 2838 ft. The course has markers every 50 yds if not more. A very nice man on a bike follows the back marker – clearing the course and offering help to anyone feeling the strain.\nAt the end the ladies of Merced y Bont ( Our WI) provide complimentary tea, coffee, jam and cheese sarnies and biscuits for runners and marshals. After the run everyone retires to the lounge bar for food drink and the trophy giving. We finish with a sing song. “Do Do the Ron Run” to the tune of the old Crystals song Da Doo Ron Ron.\nThroughout the day I rally the troops, inform, update, joke and generally drone on about all and sundry via the PA system in the Square. Occasionally (quite often actually) I confuse the mic and the walkie talkie ,calling over the PA “can you repeat that Bob”or ” how many runners are you waiting for at White Bridge” and poor Bob gets “and don’t forget to pop your change in the collection bucket. OVER” on the walkie talkie. Ever the professional. Do we laugh?!\nAnyway, Its got a friendly, family feel, its challenging for the serious runners but not impossible (especially as a relay event) for those less well-trained. It raises money for a good cause. It not too big that you won’t get noticed. The scenery is spectacular. There are mountains, forests, boggy bits, farm land,fell land,cows, horses, sheep, gates, rainbows, blue skies, happy people. The weather is (usually but not always) good. The beer at the Neuadd is home-brewed. The food is homemade. The trophies are donated by the time keepers, Pat & Roland Sherwood of On line Race Results.\nEveryone leaves smiling. And I usually leave having lost my voice (a bonus for family and the community at large!).\nIf you are a member of a running club or an individual who does a bit of running , or you know someone who is; perhaps you would be so kind as to mention this event to them. The Ron Skilton Memorial Half Marathon, as seen on the Green Events webite alongside Man v Horse and World Bog Snorkelling. It also has a FB page and we have a target of 500 like before the next event – help us get there. Please.\nIts difficult, when organising an event for it not to clash with others. However, for those who have made it to Llanwrtyd for this (slowly) growing, feel good event, its worth making this one the event of choice. Give it a try you won’t be disappointed and Llanwrtyd will make you very welcome.\nReblogged this on In the Pink and commented:\nthis year is the 10th anniversary of tis memoril event … if you live running and fundraising and spectacular scenery, and great beer, and a welcoming atmosphere etc etc… book yourself in and take part\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_04_26_why-vote/content_152.html": "So what? The European elections are rapidly approaching. Voting cards have arrived for all those on the electoral roll. Some of us will have pinned these to our notice board or diarised the 22nd May so we don’t forget. Some will have torn up and binned the card. Some will have it lying around somewhere to be found at a later date and binned as the event has passed.\nWhy vote? Its Europe not local? Why Vote? They’re all the same. As bad as each other. Can’t trust any of them. They all spout the same bullshit. I only care about local issues.\nI sense we are at an important crossroads in the UK, on the edge of a cliff, about to fall into a deep black depression, a turmoil that will have a direct and damaging effect on us, our children and generations to come. Sounds melodramatic. To be fair, I do have a tendency to be just that. However, I am scared. I’m scared by the apathy of the general public. Not to have views, but to be prepared to express them where they can count. I am scared about the unaccountability of our politicians; about the control outside forces have on our human rights and future. I’m scared about our increased tendency to accept that ‘of course they’re corrupt, they’re Politicians’.\nWe see time after time, across all parties, at all levels; fiddling of expenses; disproportionately high pay rises; over-ruling of independent adjudication; that American tendency to slag off the opposition rather than express ones own policies; distraction rather than solution; battling for power rather than better management. We seem to have lost our political way and with it diluted our consciences.\nOK, politicians have always been power-hungry; have always created policies, in part, to win votes and drag you from their opposition. These days however, I can’t really say it’s about the policies at all – not in comparison with their need to win power. We used to know where the three main parties stood. Left, Right, slightly right of centre ;-). Now they have Spin Doctors from the American school of politics, making all debates and speeches about discrediting the alternatives. Always shying away from expressing clear and concise policies backed up with realistic solutions to deliver on them.\nUntil 1992 between 75% and 85% of the electorate had their vote. since 2001 its been 59-65%; we have a disengaged young voting population and a huge proportion who express no opinion. Many people believe they have no way of telling the politicians they have no faith in any of them. Many believe that this message should get across in the fact that they have not voted at all.\nBUT NO VOTE IS NO VOICE.\nIt’s the European elections on 22nd May. If you don’t vote you don’t count.\nBut you can express a ‘disillusioned vote’ – by heading to the polling station and posting it without a cross at all, or spoiling your paper. It counts (I believe). THEY COUNT THE NUMBER OF SPOILED PAPER and BLANK PAPERS.\nYou might know nothing about Europe , not care at al,l but I promise you, EVERY SINGLE EXTREMIST whether they express any of your views or the exact opposite; WILL VOTE.\nI believe we are on the edge of great and potentially cataclysmic change – whichever way the pendulum swings. I sense frustration in the masses, unrest in the young, I see greater and greater conflict in matters relating to state and church, relating to UK Governance and European involvement (or is it interference). I see so many cracks. I see so many incidents of lying, cheating, different rules for the powerful, across all parties at Westminster level. How can we trust, who should we choose, why should we vote?\nI don’t know for sure why we should vote HOWEVER I am very sure about the consequences if we don’t. And for me that’s a good enough reason to go out there and either put a cross in a box, or register my disdain by posting a blank ballot paper. I know, if I don’t express something then the potential of slipping off that cliff into a black and scary future for me, my children, their children rests partly in my hands.\nMelodramatic? Definitely. Unjustly so? I’m not so sure.\nsource stats : http://www.ukpolitical.info",

I laugh heartily; love wholely and live completely. I write what I think. Sometimes its fun, sometimes its political, sometimes its frustration, or angst. Always its real and heartfelt.\nI now live in Mid Wales having found a home with my family (John, my parner and Jason, our son) here in Llanwrtyd Wells where everyday eccentricity is celebrated. a place in the UK that attracts those from outside the mainstream and has created an identity based on its quirkiness. A perfect home for someone like me who tends not to follow the crowd, doesn't have a quiet laugh, and tends to speak first, think later! Life has reached a juncture where I have become aware that when you live your life through rose-tinted spectacles, every experience becomes one including joy, laughter, friends, meetings, experiences and great memories. Having always fancied being a columnist I figured why not share my rose-tinted ramblings with anyone out there who might want to listen- and if no-ones out there, why not write them anyway - bit like a public diary - but hey I have no dirty little secrets that I'm not prepared to share....!!!!",

What intentional Word will you have as your 2018 mantra? mine already is Live, Love, Laugh… but I’m adding “Relax” to 2018….\nWords are powerful! They can inspire or challenge, encourage or damage. When we speak, we can build people up or we can tear them down. And we gradually start to believe the things we are told – those phrases and attitudes become our beliefs and part of our inner dialogue. This is why I believe it is so important to speak respectfully to our children – the way that we talk to them teaches them how they should talk to themselves. “A child’s inner monologue does not just happen; it is born out of what they hear from other people… When kids hear words of praise and encouragement, they learn to respect themselves.” – L, Ashar, 2012, Who Do You Think You’re Kidding? – But, it’s not just children who are moulded by words.

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_10_18_theres-no-average-day-in-the-life-of/content_681.html": "Do you have an average day? I don’t. They’re all a bit different. Often evolving as they progress, rarely planned anything more than by a vague outline, and quite often a little ‘out of the norm’ . Saying I’m not a nine to fiver is a bit of an understatement.\nWant to know what my day is doing? Well it’s now 11am and I’m here..\nYep. I’m working whilst in the bath!\nSo today is like this. I woke up at 8:30 and though ‘i fancy a bath’ so I popped off to the bathroom but there was a spider in the bath and I didn’t want to disturb him so I hopped back into bed. Hubby, as is his wonderful habit, appeared with a cup of tea and we sat in bed catching up on FB and Twitter and discussed our separate ‘plans’ for the day.\nWe have b&b guests this coming weekend so for me it was ironing bedding. I see ironing as a bit of a waste of time so whilst steaming away I practiced a belly dance routine (and I haven’t even told you before that I go to dance classes.. another day another blog); and did some toe exercises as prescribed by Katie Holland as ‘guaranteed to improve your dancing’… Katie, I’m doubtful that anything will help but I’ll let you know.\nHaving built up a steam iron sweat I’m now in the bath (fortunately Bernard the Bath Spider had buggered off) but to make better use of the time I’m both writing this for you lot and sorting out my art catalogue, making sure all my work to date is listed and titled. I have an exhibition pending and I need to make sure I know what’s where and ensure I have enough pieces in the collection. Plus I’m having half a dozen or so images printed up as cards and my photographer friend and technical whizz needs to have the wording for the backs covers.\nAlongside getting this done….\nand I’ve added a face pack…may as well spruce up properly.\nIt’s now noon. Too late for breakfast, so a quick brunch and then off to get some groceries.\nMay as well pack up my old bras and take them to the bra bank at Tescos whilst I’m at it.\nIt’s a gorgeous day so hoping to get back in time to garden at home. Still have several plants that need to go in the ground before winter sets in.\n….it’s now evening. Needless to say the gardening didn’t happen. I had about £60 in my hand from a swishing event I organised at the last-minute to clear out my wardrobe. A swish, for those who don’t know (I didn’t when invited to one last year), is a clothes swap. I’d cleared out my cupboards and had a car boot full of clothes and shoes to get rid of , friends could have them for a donation to a local charity. It raised £58 and I still managed to drop 2 large sacks of goodies at the local community charity shop.\nSo having done my shopping I went back into Aldi and spent the £58 with a view to dropping it at the local food bank. Sadly the charity was closed so that will involve another trip but look how much I got for my money!!!! Six full bags of none perishables! Aldi really is better value\nJust about to head into the garden when I remember we have a fridge freezer to pick up from a friend (I need extra storage for the catering for my 50th).\nAnd then the doorbell rings. The landlords of the flats I manage are here from Spain and I forgot they were popping in. Still they came armed with plenty of wine so I’m not complaining.\nBy which time it’s supper time. I cook a meal for me and Hubby. Bulk cook a bolognaise to add to the new freezer. Watch a movie. Then suddenly it’s midnight so off to bed.\nGuess who’s back?\nI wonder how he filled his day?\nWow, sounds very full on and hectic.\nLikeLike\nI’m just a bit ‘freerange’!\nLikeLike\nAhh, really enjoyed reading this! Busy day! Thanks for sharing it with us. #Blogcrush\nLikeLike\ni believe you can get waterproof notepads and pencils for the shower these days\nLikeLike\nthat reply was meant for @l2MyDaughter!!!! but useful to know anyway, i’m sure you’d agree 😉\nLikeLike\nWow, sounds full on!

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_08_31_what-happened-to-my-waist/content_1452.html": "I rejoined the gym today. Its been a good 2, possibly 3 years since I went. A disgrace really as we are so lucky to have a small but perfectly formed ‘honesty’ gym in the town. Situated above the Victoria Hall, after your induction (to fulfill insurance requirements) you are given your own key and for the paltry sum of £12 per month you can come and go as you please.\nMy rebirth as a weight pushing geriatric (that’s how I felt) came as a result of son number one wanting to join and not being old enough (insurance requirements again) to attend on his own. I guess I should be grateful. Looking through the devils mirrors ( impossible to avoid as they covered the walls and all the equipment faced them) this short fat saggy old woman stared back at me with discomfort etched in her face wondering how it got so fat and saggy, old and more importantly, short…. Had I had some sort of body mass redistribution surgery in my sleep, taking inches off my height and smearing them liberally around my waist and chin?!\nAnyway, i guess even the complex kit laid out in front of me could do nothing re the height issue – i did look for a rack as it did appear possible that such a medieval instrument of torture might be amongst the other weights and pullies, but no.\nI started with a shower. i know – this is not the natural order of things. however as\na. a delay tactic and\nb. a necessity having arrived not so fresh from dredging the chicken house,\nI thought it the safest and most sensible option. I was, after all, there purely to chaperone my 15 year old. By the time I came out of the shower two muscular, 6ft+ , 20 something year old Adonis(es) had signed in.\nwhat to do? Hide in the shower cubicle? Come out with a mop in hand and pretend to be the cleaner? Or brazen it out? I did. Resetting the machines from maximum load to ‘bag of sugar’ setting, draping a large towel around my shoulders and pulling at the bottom of my T-shirt in an attempt to hide the saggy bits, avoiding all eye contact , I waded in to “pump some iron”\nBut as is the way when two hulking Adonises are flexing their biceps I kept on sneaking a peek. They were happily oblivious to me – caught up in their own postulating, chatter and rap music.\nI shall return regularly to the top floor of Vic Hall. I’ll sneak in at different times feeling sure to find a slot where I have the place to myself. That always was the draw of our little private gym in our little perfect town. I’ll work on my ‘ bat wings’ , ‘love handles’, low-slung buttocks and gravity challenged chest! I’ll rediscover my waist, redefine my curves and, whilst I’m unlikely to lose weight (or gain height), I should be able to find a stronger, shapelier me in time for Christmas and that bit of winter sun we’re about to book for February.\nThe gym is there for everyone. Jason – trying to regain his stamina and strengthen his knee after a year with a recurring injury; young Adonises building muscle ready to peacock in front of the girls; dieters, fitness fanatics or people like me – middle aged, shrinking in height and expanding in midriff women who look in the mirror expecting to see their 18 year old self and discover their mothers staring back at them! Its inevitable but we will retain the will to fight it!.\nSo how’s the plan going? For the record, I think you’re being a little hard on yourself in this essay.\nLikeLike\nVery funny and so very true! x\nLikeLike\ni’ve been several times since but those damned mirrors are evil!\nLikeLike\nBrilliant article Bernie, and the photos!!!! I love you style of writing and can identify with the sentiments in this article !! Su\nLikeLike\nthanks Su. If i could even think about twisting at the waist today i may venture back – otherwise it’ll have to wait til tomorrow\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2013_11_12_is-it-urgent/content_616.html": "Until recently we had a system within our doctors surgery where if you felt rough/ill/sick/in pain but didn’t feel life threatened and in need of calling 999 or heading to A&E you could just turn up and wait and before you left you would be able to see a doctor. OK there was the ‘yellow card of shame’ – that is if you turned up on a day the was not your appointed doctor you would be asked ‘is it urgent?’ At this point you had to make a judgement and should you decide that you did want/need to see a doctor that morning – you would be handed the ‘yellow card of shame’ which basically said you didn’t feel well enough to wait until the day your own doctor was on. You would then sit in the waiting room for your turn, brandished with this card for all to see! I am not sure of the point of this? Perhaps it was in the hope that patients waiting a long time might notice that it was not your day and challenge your ‘urgency’ to see THEIR doctor? Anyway, whatever the reason, at least the system allowed you to see doctor on the day you felt unwell enough to ‘brave’ attending on any day.\nWe now have a system where you phone and book an appointment. Take this scenario;-\nI’ve been feeling Fifty Shades of Shit for some months now. Some days I’ve felt pretty good, some I’ve felt ‘not quite right’, some I’ve not been able to stay awake / stop itching/ clear a headache / sleep. Lots of minor symptoms that have gradually dragged by immune system into failure/overdrive – I don’t know, I’m not a doctor.\nFour weeks ago my voice disappeared without any other symptoms. I actually felt quite fine but couldn’t speak – heaven sent my family might say! Anyway it took a good 10 days to return coming back accompanied by swollen glands, coughing, breathlessness, wheezy chest. Aall of these symptoms are still here. Some days worse than others. Alongside this I have experienced an itchy scalp for ‘some years ‘, on and off. Initially a psychological over reaction to the continued issue of headlice at junior school. This became an obsession with constant lice combing and lice treatment despite not ever finding any. Just recently (last 4-6 weeks) this itching and feeling of ‘things crawling’ has intensified to the point where I have scratched my scalp raw – leaving welts and sores and trying all sorts of alternative treatments and solutions recommended by the WWW as well as GPs to no avail. Various other minor symptoms have manifested. Many days I feel too lethargic, ‘heady’ to do anything. ,\nI guess any of these symptoms in isolation are minor irritants at best. Also there are days when I feel pretty great. Also its been months. My partner keeps telling me to see the doctor. Friends suggest I need to see a doctor. I think about it. Then the next day I feel pretty ok. Or I think well maybe its because I overdid it yesterday/ didn’t sleep well the night before / am worrying about this or that issue / ate too late/ drank too much / ate too much / slept funny. How can that justify going to the doctor?\nSo after some months I am finally persuaded to call the surgery. They offer me an appointment for 4 days later having asked “is it urgent?”. How can I say its urgent, I’ve lived with it for months – whats another week?\nHow do you define urgent to see a GP? Even when phoning 999 or turning up at A&E we find afterwards we’ve sometimes misjudged ‘urgent’ and returned having discovered it was something minor.\nSo I say to John -” they asked me if its urgent and now have to wait another week”. He’s not happy with this (bless), in his mind it is urgent. He’s worried about me. So I phone back and say as much. The next question ‘is it urgent that you need any doctor or can it wait til tomorrow for your own doctor?” I decide I’d rather see my own doctor ‘urgently’ and am told to ring back in the morning for an ‘urgent appointment’.\nSo I phone -several times as its constantly engaged – and when I get through its a different receptionist. “I’d like to see my doctor today please, I called yesterday and was told to phone today~”\n“Is it urgent as there is only one urgent appointment left?”\nSo now I’m on the verge of saying OK I’ll leave it. I’m feeling a fraud, guilty, worried I am depriving someone ‘urgent’ of their last opportunity to see the doctor. What if I go and the doctor assess that I have taken an urgent appointment selfishly as there’s nothing particularly wrong. I’m now worried that I might be wasting the doctors time. or that someone else might deteriorate before their assigned appointment as they missed the opportunity to be diagnosed today whilst I wasted the doctors valuable time. I didn’t. John was sat there when I called otherwise I may have backed down. But I felt guilty taking that appointment. I don’t know whats wrong, if anything. Perhaps i just have a screw loose!!! I’m also worried that the doctor will judge me as a time waster, or reprimand me for taking the ‘urgent ‘ appointment.\nSo now, as well as feeling Fifty Shade of Shit, I’m riddled with guilt and frightened of being told off – I’m like a child at school who’s forgotten to bring in their homework. Its a dilemma.\nSome people, like me, struggle to approach their GP. I always feel a fraud, always forget what I need to say and always come out with a half satisfactory solution as I’ve failed to fully explain myself. I’m not ‘ill’- I can’t go in and say I think I’ve got measles, or look at this rash, or my back pain is so bad I can’t walk. I just feel like I’m lacking something or my immune system needs a boost.\nMaybe all I need is some iron tablets, or vitamins, but maybe I have high cholesterol or blood pressure or under active thyroid, may be its something more serious, maybe I’m just allergic to something. How do I know ? That’s what the doctor is for and its taken me 5 weeks of feeling more rough than normal to make the call. What I do know is that I’m feeling guilty and embarrassed for taking the last ‘urgent’ appointment and as such have asked John to come with me as I think I’m going to get ‘told off’ (hahaha)\nSo here’s the question.”Is it urgent?”\nAddendum: I’m not telling you any of this for your sympathy and concern. I am fine. Maybe a little neurotic or in need of a boost?! I’m laying my fragility on the line to make a point. this system, this question, is unfair. Maybe they should ask ‘ is it for a routine appointment?’ Perhaps that’s what they actually mean?\nWhat do you all think?\nits raised lots of response via facebook and I’m aware that some parts of the country find in even harder to access their doctor.I must reiterate I have absolutely no complaint with an of the staff. The receptionists are fabulously helpful and the doctors give you as much time and consideration as you need once you get in there. My only is is that question “Is it urgent?”\nLikeLike\nWhat they really mean is “when do you need to see the Dr? Today, within a week or later?” So that’s what they should ask. My pet bugbear is the current system where if you (or any of your family) want to get an appointment today, you have to phone at 8am and keep hitting redial like you’re trying to win a toaster on a radio show until you get through around 8:15. As I have one boy on the bus at 7:50 and two more on the bus at 8:40, 8am is not the best time to be hanging around hitting redial. Based on this post and your FB ramblings, I just phoned the doctor and said “Can I see a doctor sometime this week please?” Which got me the result I wanted!\nLikeLike",

I managed to get up and feed my B&B guests complete with smiling and chatting . Then I went back to bed. I slept until nearly 2pm… Despite Hubby trying to wake me at noon. I stayed awake long enough to reheat a cup of tea in the microwave. Sat on the front doorstep in the sun and fell asleep. Woke briefly when Hubby popped home. Long enough to get a pillow and a deck chair. Then slept in the sun.\nStayed awake to eat supper, fell asleep in front of TV. Had an early night and slept right through.\nThis was me crashing… I refer to my blog from yesterday … Oh yes I did find a moment or two to articulate my crash in blog form.. but that really was the extent of yesterday’s activities.\nSo today I am already three gardening jobs behind, racked with guilt and stressed by my backlog.\nI sat down this evening, knackered and aching from head to toe. As I berated myself for my pathetic state I announced to myself “for Christ’s sake woman you only did 3 hours work today, get a grip”…. Long pause as I’m now lying in bed. This was my day:\nWoke 7:30. Got up and prepped breakfast for our 6 B&B guests\nPlaced an order with our stained glass suppliers\nDid 3 hours heavy digging and weed clearing.\nDrove the 20 miles to our nearest supermarket. Did the weekly shop\nCollected our son\nUnpacked shopping\nSpent an hour tidying in my own garden\nHad a bath\nCleaned the bathroom\nMade a roast dinner…\n… So to be fair, considering my physical and mental state… In fact, irrespective of my physical and mental state, today was pretty full.\n..And now I can add, ‘wrote a blog’, to my achievements for today.\nOn that note, I am going to turn of the light and zzzzzzzzzzzz",

In May 2013 I announced I fancied joining the annual Pink Car Rally organised by Sali Gray and asked some friends if they fancied growing and donating their hair the following May to raise awareness of the cause and get the ball rolling. Well… June, Jen, Aurelia and Tina raised an astonishing £692 as well as donating their ponytails during the Music Madness and Mayhem event at the Neuadd Arms Hotel on 4th May 2014.\nSO, the target has risen. We’re aiming for £1000. It’s a great cause, we have generous friends and acquaintances and phase 2 will be a fun one to follow.\nYou will probably all know by now of my fabulous 1968 Hillman Husky in its new livery of Magenta pink but just in case you’ve been living in an underground bunker and missed her – here she is. Ffloyd, As in Pink Floyd; double “FF” as in Welsh!\nIf you look back through my blogs you’ll find various references to my darling car\nIt’s all very exciting. We’re still waiting for the route release and the entry forms but, as Sali confirmed “you’re on the list”. You can following the organisational progress via the events FB page if you fancy joining the ever-expanding Pink Community they have going\nI personally plan to come along mob handed or at least have ‘mob pockets’ along the route. I’m looking for an entourage of Loonies and Impers to come out and cheer the rally on. But mostly I’m after your dosh!\nAs the widget upload seems to be beyond me, you can sponsor me using this link to our JustGiving page and add to the £692 total we have because of the brave ladies who had their heads shaved. It’s a great cause, helping kids with cancer.\nAnyway, looking at previous Pink Car Rally images, I appear to be the only one taking something old and unreliable. don’t be cheeky, I’m not referring to my co-driver/partner/mechanic, John Crompton; but of course, to Ffloyd who, like me will be 46 years old.\nOfficial Monster Raving Loony Party\nOne thought on “Getting ready for The Pink Car Rally 2014…”",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_02_21_faith-and-humanity/content_1629.html": "I’m not completely sure of everything that I believe in.\nFor example, I can’t say how I feel about ghosts, spirits and their ability to communicate across planes, the form they take or whether they exist at all. I don’t know what I feel about spirits although I’ve weegee’d a fair bit and seemingly contacted various ‘spirits’. I don’t know how I feel about sentient spirits interacting with living people in that I accept something is happening but it’s probably something to do with our subconscious minds. I find it hard to accept that there is a true ability to interact across planes of existence (if there are other planes of existence). I have several friends who I would explain away as extremely empathetic , but who consider themselves to be Mediums or Spiritual Healer. I suspect a lot of healing comes from the belief in being healed. I accept there are a lot of unanswered questions and I do think there is more out there and more capacity within our brains than we yet understand or tap.\nI do believe that we have subconscious and conscious skills beyond those that most of us use. I also believe that way back before we became ‘civilised’ we were more able to tap into our instincts, communicate more intuitively and work alongside nature/seasons/elements. I do believe that our energy lives on. Science proves that energy is neither created or destroyed. When we die our physical bodies decay and feed the earth, growing plants, feeding animals, continuing the circle of life. Weather there is a ‘soul’ that exists separately? Whether this ‘soul’ contains consciousness and awareness of life as we know it? Those are matters on which I remain open to further evidence and scientific study. I am definitely a sceptic.\nI am however, completely sure of what I don’t believe.\nI do not believe and feel it factual to say that there is no all-seeing divine, super being(s) controlling/orchestrating who is good/bad; who is healed/left to suffer; who is constantly watching/ignoring; who is determining our individual fates here/in any alternative life. Religion is a man-made conscript which has evolved and changed through the millenia to suit those who dictate it and is dependant on where you were born and with what fables you were raised as to which story/ supreme being each individual worships.\nI do however, have great faith in the inherent goodness of (wo)mankind and its abilities to make a difference by offering positive thoughts/kindness/actions to others. I do believe that a charitable and positive outlook makes you a happier more enriched person. I do believe that actions speak louder than words. That giving is receiving. That laughter and friendship are the best medicine. That love conquers all.\nI am, at heart, a Humanist. I find strength and solace in my friends and acquaintances. I gain and grow from exploring new paths, listening to others and sharing kindness. I try to stand up against wrongs; be loud for those who feel they do not have a voice; offer support to those who do not have the strength. In return I try to accept the love and help of those around me , who feel the same essence of humanity and want to give of themselves as I want to give of myself.\nThis week I have been struggling. I have felt pain and weakness and fatigue. Friends have offered support each in their own way. Sympathy, spiritually, practically. I’ve had massage, pampering, kind words, visits and positive energy sent to me from all directions. Its interesting, because those with a religion will say they will pray for you. Perhaps this is the same as me or other friends , offering positive thoughts. Although we are offering humanity and nature up as a healing source; and those of religion are requesting that their supreme being consider looking out for you. In both instances the intention is the same.. it is a human wilfulness to care for your best interests and well-being.\nThe world around us; plants, animals, seasons, skies, and all of nature are suppressed by the unnatural infrastructure we have created. Nature will eventually win out. We cannot tame it . We might adjust it for a time. But when we leave, either voluntarily or through our own demise. Nature will take over again. The evidence of our footprint on the earth would soon be buried deep in the earth and nature will , if necessary continue without us. We can forge our own battles against it for our short-term convenience and gain and nature will let us; for a while. But, when we push too far, get too greedy with the resources of this planet, nature will fight back and win. And it might well do it without us being part of the natural future.\nWe think we are supreme, intelligent and resourceful because we build, invent, communicate and utilise the resources of this planet. Because we are now reaching beyond our world and in time will do the same on distant planets. But there are limited resources, limited tolerances that this planet and atmosphere will allow us to control. There has to be balance. Greed and corporations are not balance. They are egos. Egos will eventually lose to nature., be they a whole race, an economic construct, or a political ideal. These artificial controls of resources for greed, control and financial gain will eventually fall; but at what price to humankind?\nInterestingly, and surprisingly as I’ve sat here ‘mind dumping into written word’ the words spilling into this blog are not those I had expected. I was meaning to extrapolate into alternative healing and goodwill and have turned instead to ecology and economic politics! Fortunately, for me at least, that is the joy of just leaving your fingers to ride the keyboard and spill the mind onto the page. I never quite know where it will lead … sometimes, quite often actually, I’m not even aware that the thoughts that appear were even in my head. Oh the joy of letting your mind do the talking!\nAnyway, today I am being extremely kind to myself. I am being mindful. I am listening to my joints and muscles, I am giving them permission to rest and heal. I am reading, writing, sitting, resting. I am allowing my friends to advise me and guide me. I am letting my husband allow me the freedom to stop. I am relaxing, recovering and regaling my thoughts to you all.\nTry it. Let your mind wander through your fingers from a starting point of your choosing and see where it takes you. You may discover something new about yourself . Or try mine about ‘belief’.\nI would love to hear from you xxxx",

So we expected a faultless and uneventful short hop to The Rising Sun, Pandy (5 miles outside of Abergavenny. Instead we spent an hour in a layby the Brecon side of Bwlch watching the sun set, whilst cwtching John and waving to smiling drivers who passed by, hooting, giving the thumbs up and grinning at the perfect body Ffloyd sports following her cosmetic surgery. They were, no doubt oblivious to the fact that we had broken down, as, with the engine in the back, it looked like we had the boot open for a picnic.\nOne lovely man, on his way home from a hard days work did stop to offer assistance. This man, Derek Lee,(Builder and Carpenter) searched the contents of his van on our behalf for 6ft of cable (we thought we’d identified the problem and this was what was required). Finding nothing, he even offered to cut 6 foot off his extension lead for us!! Aww, Bless. How kind is that xx\nAnyway,the lovely man from Lanes arrived as promised and hoisted us onto the speck lift.\nThe joy of having a 46 year old car is that classic car insurance is not only very cheap, but comes with full breakdown recovery, offering to take you home or to your destination. It was amusing talking to the breakdown recovery helpline and requesting to be taken to The Rising Sun pub in Pandy.\n“We’ll arrange a vehicle to take you home”\n“No thanks – please drop us at the pub in Pandy!”\nI did however explain that the campsite would be full of Imp owners/mechanics/enthusiast who would scratch their heads, mull around the engine, procrastinate, deliberate and come up with a solution to make Ffloyd better.\nSo Dave towed us to our tent pitch, and, as he couldn’t stop for a pint, I pushed a tenner into his hand for a few drinks on his day off.\nTent erected we hit the bar, downed some beer (john), Vodka (me), had a meal (eventually – it was a long wait but the delay didn’t matter as the company was good , and by the time it arrived, the head was somewhat fuzzy)! There were some very merry Impers that night and some pretty subdued Impers puzzling over Ffloyd’s electrics the following morning. An electrical conundrum causing us to replace the ignition switch as it appeared to have a charge along the cable up to that point, only to discover the problem was at the other end!! (any physics graduate should be able to explain that to you if you need to know more!).\nWe missed the Imp run on Saturday a shame but at least it covered our home stomping ground. billed as 100 Welsh miles it was reportedly 140 miles taking in Llandovery Sheep Festival, Abergwesyn Valley, Llanwrtyd and the military roads over Brecon. However, John and I had a lovely day and visited Linda Vista Gardens in Abergavenny and the back street coffee shop.\nSaturday evening in The Rising sun is another story . one involving car crashes into lion enclosures, a mankini clad man , Margaret Thatcher nutcrackers and Jill witnessing a ‘double erection’ in her Rapido……..!!!!!!….. as I said, another story for another day.\nAnyway, i thought I might finish by mentioning (again) just how fabulous Ffloyd looks in her magenta and ice white livery was her mirror finish and perfect lines and curves. I must say (again) a massive thank you to Graham Crompton who has inherited his dad’s ‘perfectionist’ gene and has sweated blood and tears to delivery her back to me in such fine fettle with a First prize trophy in hand. xxxxx\nGreat blog post, Rose-Tinted – & heartwarming to hear of so many kindly folk out there … but, there’s mid-Wales for you, tydy!\nLikeLike\ntrue! although I have to say its not the first time I have come across such exceptional support in a car related incident in Wales – a great story too – i must blog about our eventful trip to St Brides Lighthouse\nLikeLike",

Another typically atypical day in the life of moi.\nToday began with the end of yesterday. As days tend to do, merging seamlessly from one day to the next without any blank no man’s space in between. But this day started with a groundhog moment. Heading home from a Halloween party at 1amish we get in and start our tomorrow. Or is it today? I guess technically after midnight becomes the next day but if you’re still in the throws of the previous day and have not been to bed yet does that mean it’s still yesterday? By which I mean not yet today. Making today still tomorrow?. Confused? I am now!\nAnyway. We got in and started doing all those things we prep when we have guests in the b&b. John checks the Ray burn is still alight and adds more coal to ensure its still cosy warm at breakfast time. He sets the bread maker so (later) in the morning the gorgeous aroma of freshly baked bread will waft up the stairs and entice the guests down for a delicious Cerdyn Villa breakfast. I prepare all the breakfast ingredients. We maybe set the table. Clear the kitchen. Set the dishwasher and washing machine.\nI check my phone for the time. It’s still just after 1am…..Am I in a time warp? No. It’s daylight saving. (Could have had an extra hour at the party).\nSo we go to bed at 1:30am which is really 2:30am but I’m all relaxed ‘cos the guests want breakfast at 8am , which is really 9am so I have loads of time?!?!\nHubby goes upstairs like this..\n…and shortly after we realise getting back to his normal handsome self is not going to be easy… the transfer is not coming off. He tries makeup remover. Nope. Soap and water. Nope. My facial scrub. Nope. My super luxurious body scrub. This bugger is not shifting. He starts scratching at it with his nails…. it’s half off when he goes to sleep. And as we feel we have so much time in the morning with our groundhog hour, we figure we’ll sort it then.\nSuddenly it’s 7:55am, which may well really feel like 8:55 am but even stretching that extra hour it still mean’s we have 5 real minutes before we find guests salivating to the smell of fresh-baked bread and longing for their full cooked breakfast. Eek. Hubby has the morning after Halloween party face and I’m not sure our guests can handle it. Then I remember how I got my transfers off. Aqueous cream or vaseline. Rub it in and the transfer slides off. Oops. Hubby is under the impression that it would have been more helpful and less painful had I remembered that seven hours previously. Oops poor Hubby and his beautiful raw face!\nAnyway. Lots of happy well fed guests who shared a laugh at Hubby’s expense. By 10 am, seven breakfasts have been served and cleared. Guests have checked out. Rooms are stripped. Dishwasher is loaded. Washing machine is going full pelt and I’ve made us a brunch after all its 11am in our heads!\nIt’s a gorgeous day. Sun was shining when we woke, (thankyou day light saving for repositioning 7am in the 8am slot) and I still had half a dozen plants that needed to go in the ground before the first frost; Hubby had the lawn to cut and the garden furniture all needed moving/storing ready for the tree felling to take place next week.\nFour hours of strenuous digging, weeding, plant moving and clearing in my poor neglected garden and I can barely stand. So Hubby sends me for a soak. And here I am. Soaking, blogging and enjoying a nice cuppa.\nDid you remember to turn back your clocks?\nWow that’s some very impressive Halloween make up. I bet he was relieved when it finally came off though haha. I’m also very impressed that you were setting up freshly baked bread at 1/2 am. That’s serious dedication if you ask me and I bet it smelled wonderful in the morning. Thanks for linking to #DreamTeam x\nLikeLike\nHow do you master blogging while bathing? Need tips. Lol. #dreamteam\nLikeLike\nHaha..do you mean Halloween or daylight saving? It’s a nightmare to know when time is such an illusion\nLikeLike\nAh, isn’t that next weekend?\nLikeLike",

I hope your readers enjoy learning a bit more about my ordinarily extraordinary life 😉 ………………….\nBLOGGER’S CORNER WITH BERNI FROM ROSE TINTED RAMBLINGS\nThe Blogger’s Corner series is an interview series featuring advice and experience from bloggers whose blogs are older than six months.\nIf you would like to take part, you can find all of the details here.\nThis week, we have the lovely Berni from Rose Tinted Ramblings.\n1 Introduce yourself\nHi, I’m Berni from Rose Tinted Ramblings. I’m a mum, step-mum, new grandmum, artist, B&B owner, gardener, teacher, member of the Monster Raving Loony Party, part of a community that organises wacky events, carer, cafe worker, organiser, advocate and blogger. I want a bit of it all.\n2 Tell us a little bit about your blog\nMy blog is as eclectic as me. It’s a salvation and it’s the place where I talk about anything and everything. Usually with a rose tinted glint but occasionally a rant or a shout for help.\nHow I’m prone to suffering from anxiety and panic attacks.\nMy struggles with saying ‘no’.\nMy love of being a mum.\nHow I completely revamped my life by chucking it all in and moving it to Mid Wales with my hubby and son in tow.\nBasically you will read about the less than ordinary life that we lead and the thoughts and opportunities it generates.\n3 What can your readers learn from your blog?\nLearn? I guess that there is no such thing as ‘normal’.\nMy view on life is that we are all unique and everything presents an opportunity, we just have to open our eyes and see. Everything is connected. We are a community and it works best when we work together. I hope my zest for life and the pursuit of extraordinary within the ordinary helps demonstrate that.\n4 What’s your favourite thing about blogging?\nI love the release I get from getting my thoughts out of my head and onto the screen. Occasionally they never reach the ‘publish’ button, but they’re out there. I love the interactions that a post can generate and the conversations they can start. And sometimes the doors they open presenting me with new opportunities\n5 And your least favourite thing about blogging?\nI’ve been blogging a while now but only very recently thought about making it any more than an online diary. I want to move to the next level without changing my ethos of openness and honesty.\nI am finding it really hard to decide how and where to start with working with brands and generating a little bit of income from my blog. I guess I dislike my indecision and procrastination about taking the leap and contacting a brand (so if you want to offer me any tips I’d be most grateful).\nThe other reason I don’t move forward is the tech… it’s scary.\n6 Tell us one random fact about you\nI think I’m pretty random as it is. …but here’s one…. I have an alter ego, Lady Lily the Pink (she even has her own Facebook Page), oh and I drive a magenta pink 1968 Hillman Husky with a pink fur roof…. the car came first everything else pink in my life followed. I guess that’s two things, but who’s counting #rulesaretheretobebroken\n7 If you could only blog about one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be and why?\nIt would be about our life in Llanwrtyd Wells (LW) because that would encompass so much – my B&B, Cerdyn Villa, which made the whole move here possible; the being a Loony; because LW was the spiritual home of Monster Raving loony Party founder, Screaming Lord Sutch, (it’s also where he played his last ever gig before he died); its where we raised our son; it’s where all the other weird stuff happens like the World Bog Snorkelling which I help organise and commentate for, and likewise the man v horse marathon and the Real Ale Wobble…. It’s also the place where I became a real artist.\n8 What was the hardest part of starting your blog and why?\nStarting the blog was easy. I went in with no expectations other than getting stuff off my chest. Growing it into something that justifies the amount of time I give to it, is another thing entirely\n9 If you could give new bloggers one piece of advice, what would it be?\nLet it evolve. Talk to as many other bloggers as possible. All the help we need is out there so keep asking questions.\n10 Is there anything you know now that you wish you’d known in the beginning?\nNo. I’m glad I didn’t know it could be a way of earning money because I don’t think I would have enjoyed it so much. There are things I wish I knew now. However, I am finding them out. Slowly.\n11 Do you have any long term goals for your blog?\nI want my blog to stay as loose and real as it already is but encompass an earning opportunity. When people read it, whether it’s just me chatting about life or me writing something sponsored. I want it to have the same ‘straight from the heart, through the fingers to the page’ feel as it does now.\nI’m working towards making that possible\nI’d also love to meet up with some of the fabulous sounding people I talk to out there. Perhaps I should organise a meet up at my B&B 😉\n12 Who’s your blogging hero?\nAs an artist the first artist blogger I followed and still do is Janet Weight with her lovely watercolours, hummingbirds and gentle prose.\nThen there’s the mummy bloggers: Lucy of What My Fridge Says because she’s edgy and hilarious; Dawn of Rhyming With Wine for her zest and poetry; Jo, Slummy Single Mum, again for her humour but also she has teens.\nFor comedic value and the first blogger I really had any banter with, Steve McSteveFace…(I don’t know his real surname) he makes me laugh. His blog is random and eclectic. As he says himself “I’M JUST A GUY, WRITING STUFF ON A BLOG – HOPING PEOPLE WILL READ IT”. Well me too.\nThere are so many more I could list, including some fantastic dad bloggers, and obviously you, Debbie.\n13 What’s your favourite social media network and why?\nIt used to be Facebook. But since I found Twitter I think that’s become my social media of choice. It’s not bogged down with advertising, it doesn’t sort your shit out and tell you what you want to read, you get to do that . It’s just easier to navigate from a blogger perspective.\nI’m a bit slow at grasping social media… I have both Pinterest and Instagram accounts but haven’t really embraced them yet.\n14 Anything else you want to share with us?\nSo much. That’s why I write.\nSeriously though, I want to share my gratitude to those of you who have read me, commented on me, re-tweeted me, shared me, and/or follow me; those bloggers who’ve inspired me (I will have told you in a comment somewhere I’m sure); those bloggers I’m yet to discover; and in particular Hayley of Mission Mindfulness, who gave me my first guest post opportunity and you Debbie for giving me my second.\n15 Where can we find you? (blog link and links to any social media)\nsee\nLook, a button code!\nGreat to find out more about you! Facebook is my favourite as it was the only social media I used before becoming a blogger #dreamteam\nLikeLike\nOh my gosh Bernie! I LOVE that car, and it has nothing to do with it being bright pink *coughs. What a fab guest post and it’s so nice to find out a bit more about you. The fact that you have a facebook page for the other you just makes me even more excited to see where your blog is going. Thanks so much for joining us for the #DreamTeam x\nLikeLike\nGreat interview..and lovely answers..\nLikeLike\nFab interview! I always love reading these, I think it’s because I’m so nosy! #LGRTStumble\nLikeLike\nYou, my dear, sound like one of a kind! I love your pink car and your wacky outlook on life. Great interview.\n#LGRTSumble\nLikeLike\nGreat interview! I gotta say I love the magenta pink 1968 Hillman Husky. 🙂 #LGRTStumble\nLikeLike",

Romans, charioteers, Saturnalia feast, togas…. just another of the weird and wonderful festivals and events we like to enjoy her in our little town in the Welsh heartlands. A good way to cheer up a dreary Saturday in January\nIs this the 9th or 10th, or 11th World Mountain Bike Chariot Racing, I forget, but that’s not important. Green Events, who run this, also run a multitude of other ‘alternative’ sporting events. They began 35 years ago with the creation of the Man v Horse v Bike Marathon (now only Man v Horse due to bridleway legislation). Annually this attracts both media and participants from around the globe.\nThen came World Bog Snorkelling, often televised on channels such as Transworld Sport and Eurosport. Add to these Real Ale Wobbling, Bog Triathlon, Mountain Bike Bog Snorkelling and, more recently the bi-annual fortnight of World Alternative Games and you have yourself one pretty special place. You’d probably be surprised then to discover its nestled in the middle of Wales at the bottom of the most rural county and in the UK’s smallest town, Llanwrtyd Wells, population c700, except on event weekends when it might double in size.\nSo, following Mari Llwyd and the torch lit processions that saw in our New Year, we have just energised 2017 with a spot of charioteering with a difference. Two mountain bikes joined on a fixed metal T-bar, pulling an oil drum chariot around the grounds of a rural holiday centre.\nAnd, tonight, once the mud is washed off and the tootsies de-thawed, we shall enjoy a Saturnalia feast and toga party in our favourite watering hole, The Neuadd Arms Hotel\nHehe what a quirky idea! It sounds like great fun! A bit of something different does you good! #blogcrush\nLikeLike",

The shower and toilet facilities are fantastic. There’s a bar but campers are also welcome to bring their own just not into the event section. Loads of people bring along really really large telescopes. It’s really family friendly; workshops for adults and kids, stalls (I’ll have a range of cards and skyscape art with me), great and inspiring FREE talks to attend, loads of varied music and children’s entertainment.

It was a truly magnificent year. I created and helped make a legacy that will long outlast me and for that I will be forever proud.\nMy son finished his first year at of his Mechanical Engineering Degree at Cardiff Uni with the equivalent of a first and is thriving and enjoying his second year. He loves me and Hubby and is not afraid to show it. We have a great relationship and see him and his friends loads..\nI turned 50 and was overwhelmed by the number of cards, gifts and, most importantly, people, who came and celebrated it with me , it was the most joyous and long, celebration\nI became a (step) grandma. I say “step” purely to accentuate what a young grandmother I am (tee hee) ; I love him as my own as I do my two absolutely gorgeous stepsons.\nAnd….. I am about to have the preview of my first ever solo art exhibition ….eek…on the 12th January. I am setting it up with the curator at the Radnorshire Mueum in Llandrindod Wells this Friday. Wish me luck.\nOn reviewing my 2017 goals it became apparent to me that to progress and achieve what I want not only do I need to get myself more organised (have ordered white board and wall planners/calendar) but I need to learn some new skills. I’ve been using twitter for a good 18 months now but I really feel like I’m missing the trick but I don’t know what the trick is so don’t know what questions to ask. I also don’t use Instagram or Pinterest even though I have accounts as I really can’t see how to use them properly . I need some social media courses.\nThis is what I want to do;\nI want to LEARN, I want to APPLY that learning by INTERACTING more appropriately\n- I need to find a local guru who will run a small group or one to one workshop relatively locally, even in my house – I’m happy to provide the venue. LEARN advanced skills for Twitter. LEARN how to get the best out of Pinterest and Instagram and decide whether it it is advantageous to use all these platforms in relation to the time I would need to commit to maintaining all these platforms\n- Sort out my blog/website. At the moment I have an old website that I can’t update http://www.cerdynvilla.co.uk. I also have a new blog/website cerdynvilla.wales which is supposed to be my ‘lifestyle’ hub and link all my facets together B&B , stained glass and art, teaching, blogging etc…needs completely restructuring…. its on wordpress so in theory I should be able to do it myself but am happy to pay someone (you know who you are 😉 ) for a half day or full day of their time to get it right and remove the old site\n- Decide what I want each platform to achieve and either get them working together or seperate them. For example twitter is pretty much the place I rant on about politics, religion, women’s issues, mental health etc but I also want it to enjoy all the linkys and maybe I also want it to generate business for art and glass. So does this mean I should have 2 accounts?\n- FB – should I be using FB pages instead of websites for Cerdyn Villa B&B and Berni Benton Art and Glass or do the pages suffice? Should they link to blogs instead?\nOnce I’ve embraced the learning I should be able to work towards some measurable goals, so, following on from 2017 and my review of how that went here are my 2018 measurable goals\n- STAINED GLASS DESIGNING, COMMISSIONS, TEACHING : create a pricing sheet so people can access my services and know what they are likely to be charged and how. I think sometimes people don’t ask for a window or a design because they are embarrassed about asking the cost and then having to decline the service. Likewise, because I don’t have a structure for costing, I always find I’m underselling myself. Sometimes I think I lose business because I am too cheap, it gives a false message that I’m either not very confident in my abilities or my work isn’t good enough to charge the going rate. SO in JANUARY I need to create a charging/costing structure and then advertise it somewhere (using the social media learning that I will have implemented by then or not long after)\n- TEACHING: organise and advertise the first private workshop at my home studio for late January / early February and RUN IT !!! Get my head around a stained glass retreat combining teaching with staying at my B&B , possibly engage with other crafters/artists. Decide a format and advertise it in JANUARY. Run a trial retreat early MARCH. I’d also like to continue to co teach at Myddfai, offer more workshops and hopefully have the opportunity to deliver a window project similar to the one Jan-Jun 2017, from SEPTEMBER 2018. This means keeping up the momentum within the team at Myddai to source a funding stream and create the opportunity. I need to be proactive in that.\n- COMMISSIONS: target is to obtain commitment and complete 6 glass or art commissions in 2018. I have one painting commission deadline November 2018, a small glass commission for this month. I hope that two window commission I did the drawings for and quoted for last year will come to fruition this year, if not I need new ones to replace them and two more.\n- PUBLIC SPEAKING – I have offered to do two, Womens Institute talks already during 2018. I want to run them with a view to obtaining commissions or teaching opportunities. My goal is to write the talk and decide the demo, prepare a ‘talk pack’ so I know exactly what I need and how long it will take. I want to have this ready by EASTER.\n- TWITTER: I wonder if 750 followers is too much to ask of myself by the end of 2018? Most importantly I want to be more INTERACTIVE; LEARN how to set up useful lists; use my lists; what the point of moments are; and engage in more linkys. I think setting a follower target is probably the only way to measure progress on Twitter. However. I get the vague feeling that there are better ways to analyse twitter success / failure. That will come with the learning… you can find me on twitter @Berni_Benton\n- I’ve joined @64M_Artists and their #TheJanuaryChallenge. My goal is to complete all the daily tasks and share (some) of them. its a great idea. 5-10 minutes a day to do something creative and be a bit mindful about how you felt doing it. Then share via their FB ( @64millionartists )and/or Twitter ( @64M_Artists )\n- BLOGGING – another area where I really want to be able to measure my success in terms of interaction, what I want to do is know who is reading, responding to and sharing my blog. However, at the moment my prime reason for blogging is my need to ‘mind dump’. But I do like it when other people find my ramblings interesting in some way. I also love to read other peoples blogs. For want of a better measuring tool I will pick these two arbitary numbers by which to measure my blogging success in 2018. Please bloggers out there, advise me of a better way to measure. Followers – increase from 143 to 200; views from 18.000 to 25,000. There must be better stats to keep watch of.\n- FACEBOOK: I went back in 2017 and redivided my Cerdyn Villa B&B page from my Berni Benton Glass and Art page. For a while it made total sense to combine them but now I’m a ‘real’ Artist (what with having both commission and an exhibition under my belt – ooo eer get me!), I think they need to stand independently whilst supporting each other. Again its the interaction that really matters and I guess I could measure that by targeting reviews. so here we go. For @BerniBentonGlassArt, I’d love to have 35 reviews by year end. I’d also like to have 1000 followers (thats a step up from 11 and 753 respectively). @CerdynVillaBandB I’ll aim for 35 reviews and 500 followers (from 11 and 375).\n- OK here’s the target that I least want to do but most need to achieve. I need to make stock items for outlets in the area. I have a catalogue of my own designs made into light catchers which sell well – garden birds, Easter themes, Christmas themes, potted flowers etc but I never have any made. I advertise some of them for sale ‘made to order’ over at my Etsy shop but I really must get some stock made…. so (even as I’m typing this my head is shouting ‘won’t happen’.) I’m setting myself a target of 2 stock items a week on top of any that are specific orders… that’s 100 speculative items to make before Christmas. Keep asking me how I’m doing folks otherwise this one may drop by the wayside again this year and I will be so ashamed of myself.\n- The Vlog… I’m not setting this as a target as I failed to embrace it last year. What I am hoping is that it will organically become part of my social media development once I engage in the learning process.\nSo there we go, 10 (well 9) measurable targets for the business me for 2018. I’ll keep you posted (whether you like it or not!)\nIn life my goal remains my mantra Love, Laugh, Live; and, as I shimmy my way into 2018, I feel full of hope for a glorious 12 months.\nHappy New Year xxx\nI love all the pondering out loud you’ve done in this post because it helps me to think through some of the stuff I’m wondering about as well.\nAnd congratulations on the new grandmothering gig! I have two grandies, and am so thankful for them!\nLikeLike\n#thesatsesh ohhh i love a woman with a vision. Good luck on your learning journey, there’s loads over youtube to help you with social media, although i agree that someone sitting with you is always better. I love the excitement of a new baby in the family too and not to mention your exhibition. Lots to look forward too 🙂 glad you joined us at the saturday session. x\nLikeLike\nOh wow, your 2017 sounded brilliant, and I think the goals you have set for 2018 will make for just as good a year as last. I feel very motivated to set my own goals for the coming year after reading your post. Your art pieces are fabulous – you are very talented. Congratulations on becoming a grandma. #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nWell happy belated birthday – your cake looks amazing! You sound very enthusiastic and determined – I think you will have a very successful year! #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nYou are very artistic, something that I definitely am not, although I do have a try every once in a while, much to my family’s amusement! #satsesh@_karendennis\nLikeLike\nWow your art work is amazing. That is something to be proud of designing that window. On top of that your a grandma that’s lovely and you celebrated a special birthday. It sounds like 2017 was your year. I truly hope 2018 carries on this way for you. Good luck with your exhibition. So exciting and such an inspiration to your children and grandchildren x\nLikeLike\n#satsesh sorry x\nLikeLike\nWow your 2017 sounds like it was amazing and going by your goals for 2018 you have another very fulfilling year ahead if you! You are so talented and must be so proud of your pieces. A retreat sounds like a brilliant idea! Thanks for linking to #DreamTeam and Happy New Year! X\nLikeLike\nSuch an energetic lady you are, I wish you a great 2018. And my New Year resolution is to comment more often on your posts. I read them and love keeping up with you and yours but rarely do I press the right buttons and it is nice to know that there is someone out there. I find my blogging very cathartic and it gives me an excuse for sitting with my cup of coffee just that little bit longer. Lots of love to you and yours. xxSue\nLikeLike\nWhat a goal setter you are! Make it happen momma! And Mazel Tov on the grand baby! How very lovely! xoxo #dreamteam xoxo\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThanks Lisa. Can’t wait to give him a big squeeze tomorrow when we finally get to see him again\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nMwah! 🤗😘✨\nLikeLike\nWow, Bernie, I feel exhausted just reading through your list of media objectives. Can’t help you with any of them, but why don’t you use Myddfai Wednesdays to achieve your two pieces of glass per week. Then we can all help with this one goal. Always here if you think I can help xxx\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThat is an excellent idea x\nLikeLike",

Not only does that make it pretty special, but it also provides a damned fine excuse to partaaay!\nThe Monster Raving Loony Party, under its founder and original leader, Screaming Lord Sutch, had a particular affinity with this area: with his unique personality, penchant for rock n roll (remember The Savages?) and a liking for a sociable get together; he opted for regional HQs in his favourite drinking holes.\nWithin Powys, we have The Neuadd Arms Hotel for Brecknockshire and The Ridgebourne Inn for Radnorshire. Radnorshire also has its very own Loony representative, in the form of Lord Offa of the Dykes.\nAnd whilst I don’t stand, I remain happy to represent Loonies in the Brecknockshire area under my alter ego of Lady Lily the Pink.\nCurrent leader of the Party, Alan Hope, is bringing the annual party conference to its Radnorshire home, offering all us loonies (both those lauding it out in the open and you closet types 😉 ), the chance to enjoy a weekend with our alter ego(s).\nTo this end, and until after the Conference I officially declare myself on FB by my alter ego, AKA Lady Lily the Pink.\nIf, like me, you too have an alter-ego or would like to create one in celebration of all things alternative; then why not go ahead. If you have FB, start by adding an alternative name. Then having found your inner Loony, why not join the reveries? You don’t need to join the OMRLP to join in the fun. Just come along and explore your Loony side amongst friends, in Llandrindod Wells, 26th – 28th September at the Monster Raving Loony Conference.\nThere’ll be loads of great live music courtesy of Lord Offa and Habit Formed Records), plenty of beer swilling, joviality, laughter, a spot of Morris Dancing and plenty of alter-egos. I guarantee a friendly and welcoming weekend. And… of course… you can witness a full on Cabinet Reshuffle…\nso come on, release your inner Loon and join us for a PARTY …\nI do love this one:):) Thank you.

From simply remembering songs/tunes/writers/performers through to singing or playing any musical instrument.\nI was the only child in junior school, where choir was compulsory, to be told I could mime the words. Something that had a profound effect on me throughout adolescence and adulthood until recently . I was always embarrassed to sing and would always mime. Now I blast it out and to hell with it. Everyone is entitled to sing , whether they are in tune or not, its good for the soul.\ni think about this a lot these days. Having been engulfed in music and musical initiatives since arriving in Llanwrtyd. I am in awe of anyone who can sing or play an instrument. I even have trouble keeping rhythm with a triangle. Which, incidentally, was all I was allowed to play in music lessons in high school with Mr Rooke. Music lessons were agony.\nLlanwrtyd Wells is the Brecknockshire constituency home of the Monster Raving loony Party. Screaming Lord Sutch had a thing for constituency offices in pubs . In Brecknockshire its The Neuadd Arms Hotel, in Radnorshire its The Fountain Inn, Llandrindod.\nSo 70s rock and eccentricity have a long history in LW. Little surprise the idea of a Loony Party Music Festival finally fell out of the minds of some of the LW-afflicted visitors and residents. Screaming Lord Sutch played his last ever gig in the Neuadd Arms before committing suicide 16th June 1999 and there is a memorial on the wall in his recognition.\nIn honour of this link and in recognition of my general pinkness, I joined the Loony Party – my alter ego “Lady Lily of the Pink” occasionally surfaces for events and parties\nso much musical talent surrounds me. My son, Jason plays in a rock band -actually, several rock bands and his first band, Lindsays Shirt were the youngest band ever to be invited to Brecon Fringe. There is constant music practice in my house and I love it.\nJohn strums guitar too and can sing. In fact for our 10th anniversary he surprised me (just a bit) by having had written – from his notes and by another musical friend of ours, Ian Harvey – a song , just for me, about us. not only did he have it written, he went into the studio and recorded it, had it produced and presented my with the CD.

That’s not to say that I have no idea what I am going to do when I wake up in the morning, just a vague notion of what I might get done if the universe doesn’t get in the way. I feel that if my preparations become too concrete, the world picks up on this and throws a spanner in there – so I try to keep things sort of just in the corner of my mind’s eye, if you get my drift.\nAnyway, there are two examples of this from the last three days. Firstly, after making detailed plans to spend Saturday helping Jason weld up his car exhaust and replacing the throttle cable on Berni’s car, we get a last-minute booking for the B&B and we have no rooms even slightly ready… and I mean still-full-of-decorating-crap not ready. Cue the last-minute booking panic procedure! As it turned out we still also managed to fix the cars, but it wasn’t at quite the leisurely pace I had envisaged.\nToday I had big plans to make a massive dent in the remains of the afore-mentioned decorating, until that was, I heard what sounded like a truck crashing into a massive metal tank from outside the back door. I couldn’t see anything that might have caused this, so put it down to the military messing around on the range again and carried on with my morning chores (albeit with a small section of my brain still trying to work out what that sound could have been). A little later there was a strange whooshing noise from outside which once again I could not identify.\nStepping through the back door I was assailed with the stench of gas and immediately looked towards our propane gas tank. The cover seemed to be missing and there was a fountain of liquid propane squirting out of the pressure relief valve. Eeeek! Straight onto the emergency hotline and a technician was despatched – in the interim I was advised not to strike any matches, flick any switches or create a spark by any other means.\nOnce my saviour arrived it became evident that the last gas delivery man had over-filled the tank and the 10 degree increase in temperature since that delivery, along with the fact that the sun was shining, had caused the liquid to boil and the gas pressure to increase until the valve let rip to release the otherwise very dangerous pressure. This was something that just didn’t happen in winter he had great joy in telling me.\nAfter he vented a large amount of liquid into the air the pressure dropped sufficiently for just gas to be escaping, so that he was able to set light to it and flare off the excess. It turns out that this excess is at least 150 litres and it will take several hours to reduce the pressure to safe levels. As I am writing this, the sun is setting and the massive flame is starting to look quite pretty – shame about the horrible roaring sound that goes with it.\nSo, after two hours or so the gas pressure has been normalised and the tank and all connected systems have been checked for safety. Life may now go on as before, except without any firm plans!\nHere are some short video clips that give a better idea of what was experienced today:",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2016_02_03_life/content_1639.html": "If we are lucky life is a joyous adventure. If we are lucky enough to be born into a loving family; if we are taught to grab opportunities; if our eyes are trained to see the good and the beauty and variety around us; if we learn to think for ourselves…. life will be a journey built from chapters which when read back thrill our senses. They may contain some stress and sorry but should also contain some thrill, or joy , or achievement.\nIt is impossible in life to live every chapter without some loss; the break up of a relationship; the passing of a parent, pet, family member or friend. It is impossible and impractical to go through life without some levels and times of stress; exams, job interviews, house moves, career choices. It is also unlikely that we get from birth to death without unexpected challenges: ill-health, redundancy, financial crisis for example.\nBut with every loss comes the reminiscences of love and happy times. With every stress comes a time of completion, achievement or opportunity. And with every challenge comes an opportunity to reassess, reevaluate and grow.\nLife is not about the end goal because the end will certainly be that which comes to us all… the inevitable. Our death. Life is about the enjoyment and achievements of each chapter.\nChildhood is not just about learning to walk and talk; read and write. It’s also about fun and games, friendship and play, learning to share, be compassionate, communicate. Teenage is not just about exams and future career planning. It’s about relationships, growing independence, identifying your passions, and daring to dream. Adulthood is not just about earning the most money, and working for your retirement. We should enjoy our friendships; forge our relationships; make choices that make us happy; share our experiences. Retirement is not just about slowing down and worrying about our health. We have the opportunities to travel, or play, or indulge in hobbies. Of course amongst all the ‘living the dream’ we have to balance out responsibilities and deal with the unplanned, and, sometimes, undesired interruptions. But I believe, that when we can, whatever our age, we should follow our hearts, and live our dreams.\nFor some that may be reaching the top of our chosen career ‘ladder’, earning big money, owning expensive things; for others that may mean travelling and playing; vocation, charity. For most of us our plan will forever evolve as we learn new things; get presented with new opportunities; walk through new doors and make choices at each crossroads. Where will we live?who shall we marry? shall we marry? do we want children? can we have children? etc etc etc.\nWe all end our lives with a sadness; our own final curtain. With luck we will reach that at a ripe old age having written our adventure story with flare and chapters crammed full of happy memories and achievements; laughter and joy… things that will secure our ongoing existence in the stories and behaviours of our children and friends.\nIsn’t it wonderful when you catch yourself remembering someone passed in an anecdote or family tradition or the way someone else smiles or gestures. For me its the old photos, piggy walkers and dancing round lampposts…..\nI’ve spent my life writing each chapter like a new genre of book. I’ve not known from one chapter to the next where it will take me. I follow a winding path with many side roads and I often like to detour down one. I am lucky. But I also know that we are also responsible to ourselves for creating some of that luck….. it’s about attitude.\nAttitude: Have it, relish it, grasp it.\n“Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely, in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather a skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up and loudly proclaiming, “Wow! What a ride!”” – Hunter S Thompson\nThis blog is dedicated to two great men: my father-in-law, Brian Crompton and my uncle, Ray Benton… both gone but far from forgotten. They will live on and on and on and on.",

Usually something pampery, for example a weekend of shopping & clubbing in Brighton; a Spa weekend; maybe some pole dancing sessions or a burlesque makeover: usually involving champagne. There might be L plates, willie shaped straws possibly a veil, but we always look after the bride-to-be and her enjoyment and wellbeing is the priority.\nWhen the boys get together its a whole different ball game. Men tend to be more ‘mischievous’ sometimes downright mean (it appears to us ladies) It seems, in male psyche that the ‘meaner’ the plan the greater the friendship?! Maybe its a test of friendship that the more embarrassment you pile onto your ‘friend’ and the better the spirit in which they take it , the greater their friendship is proved to be. Its alien to us ladies I think – One of many examples towards proving we really are from different planets\nSo this weekend, arranged by a best man who , incidentally, was absent during the daytime revelry due to work commitments, had, said groom stripped to a baaing posing pouch, drink whiskey liqueur through a snorkel and bogsnorkelling in Llanwrtyd Wells. After which the poor chap had to walk the mile or back to the village – butt cheeks and all exposed (fortunately it was a warm and sunny day). It was us (or me ) that added the Bog Frog timekeeper to the day. The group had arranged a weekend that began with lunch at Neuadd Arms, special access to Waen Rhydd with a session of Bogsnorkelling, a night of revelry in and around Llanwrtyd followed by a second activity day elsewhere. I guess by stag party standards it was pretty tame – no-one died!!!!\nI thought they were going to dress up so offering myself as Bog Frog, (costumed borrowed from my very ‘game’ friend, June Duncan or New Hall Guesthouse – who went to trafalgar Square and stood on the 4th plinth to help promote Llanwrtyd). As it happened, apart from the sheep posing pouch and the very kind offers to squeeze it to check it still worked after the snorkelling attempt (I did decline by the way!), I was the only one even dressed!!! Still there are worse things than spending the afternoon with a dozen men with variously toned abs and various levels of skimpy swim garment.\nHere’s a stag party who joined us last year for a go in the Bog\nJust another ‘less ordinary’ weekend in Llanwrtyd Wells, Bog Snorkelling capital of the world.\nPS: The main event takes place this weekend & here’s some of last years pictures\nCome along, watch or take part – Sunday 25th August…dare you…..\n2 thoughts on “Frogs, Bogs and Men in Speedos…..”",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_01_24_seeking-insight-from-theists-for-us-atheists/content_273.html": "I’ve had a lot of flack since writing about Atheism . It odd because it seems that Theist wouldn’t mind if i was announcing converting from say Judaism to Scientology or becoming a Mormon or Amish ; but to openly announce that you have faith in the belief that there is NO GOD at all becomes an outrage to which they respond very badly. They tend to take the offensive position.\nIf you are likely to be personally offended because I am asking difficult questions in relation to any faith or ‘God’, please don’t read on. I am not seeking to offend. I am requesting a Theists insight.\nOften you see,whilst browsing on FB or the internet, little posts offering a prayer or anecdotes to explain why ‘God’ has seemingly ignored a prayer. Here’s one I’ve seen before but happened to appear again shortly after my last blog:\nMe: Why did You let so much stuff happen to me today?\nGod: What do u mean?\nMe: Well, I woke up late. : My car took forever to start. At lunch they made my sandwich wrong & I had to wait. On the way home, my phone went DEAD, just as I picked up a call. : And on top of it all off, when I got home ~I just want to soak my feet in my new foot spa & relax. BUT it wouldn’t work!!! Nothing went right today! Why did You do that?\nGod: Let me see, the death angel was at your bed this morning & I had to send one of My Angels to battle him for your life. I let you sleep through that. : I didn’t let your car start because there was a drunk driver on your route that would have hit you if you were on the road. The first person who made your sandwich today was sick & I didn’t want you to catch what they have, I knew you couldn’t afford to miss work. Your phone went dead because the person that was calling was going to give false witness about what you said on that call, I didn’t even let you talk to them so you would be covered. Oh and that foot spa, it had a shortage that was going to throw out all of the power in your house tonight. I didn’t think you wanted to be in the dark.\nMe: I’m Sorry God\nGod: Don’t be sorry, just learn to Trust Me…. in All things , the Good & the bad.\nMe: I will trust You.\nGod:\nMe: I won’t God. And let me just tell you God, Thank You for Everything today.\nGod: You’re welcome child. It was just another day being your God and I Love looking after My Children…\nREPOST if you Believe in HIM\nHarmless enough – if not a little contrived. So I thought this time instead of just ignoring it as foolish and far-fetched, I would present different scenarios in the hope that the Theists might provide some insight using, perhaps, the same tools to explain. I wanted to know what the answer from God would be to the following scenarios. surely not “And don’t doubt that My plan for your day is Always Better than your plan”:\nScenario 1 “God can I ask you a question, yesterday a tsunami hit and all my family were killed including my wife who was pregnant with our 4th child”.\nScenario 2 “God can I ask you a question for four years now our crops have failed , we pray for rain, our children die of dysentery and starvation, slow painful deaths, why did you not answer the payers of all our village”\nScenario 3: “God tell me – we are a loving family we go to church, pray , lead a christian life, yet my wife is struck down with ME, my son has ADHD and my mother has just been diagnosed with bowel cancer, can you not hear me am I not a faithful follower”\nI didn’t get the response I expected , or rather I did but I’d hoped for more. I got accused of not respecting other people’s beliefs as I’d declared I did in my previous blog. So I reread it and I don’t see that my question is offensive. Unless the doctrines of the various religions cannot account for them and the followers feel threatened by having such anomalies to their practice of prayer, raised.\nThese scenarios and many others like it are of genuine concern, sadly things like these happen all the time to countries, communities or individuals; both theists of various faiths and atheists irrespective of faith, prayer, church attendance etc. So I hoped someone from any religion would offer me a religious view of the lack of ‘Gods’ intervention in the various situations. The benefits of having faith, belief, prayer in such scenarios.\nWhen bad things happen to good people, it is , as far as I can tell, either passed over (the blind eye enabling the blind faith) or dismissed as “free will”, or “God works in mysterious ways”. Mostly side lined.\nIf a good Christian is killed by an Atheist – why didn’t God protect the Theist? If a good Christian is killed by another Christian, and the second Christian repented his sins – would he still go to the Kingdom of Heaven? What about the poor dead Christian, what about the poor innocent family and friends of the poor dead Christian. How will the dead Christian feel in the Kingdom of Heaven when the murder struts in some years later because although he was evil all his life he had repented his sins and was genuinely sorry before the Day of Judgement\nI’d be happy to be enlightened, offered insight . But no Theist seems to be prepared to discuss such scenarios.\nWhat about the 6 million dead Jews during the holocaust – why weren’t they protected by their God? Why weren’t they saved the suffering and pain. Why did God not ‘Cast down his wrath” on the ‘bad guys’? Was theirs (the Jews) the wrong God, or the wrong set of doctrines in line with the God?\nI try to understand how Theists don’t see the irony and juxtaposition of their comments. Say, for example, 999 people die in the train wreck, 1 child is found alive. God is thanked for saving the one. what about the other 999??? What about the pain and trauma to the poor child to have live through the crash and lost his parents – what did he do to deserve that?\nAny Theists out there want to have a crack at explaining any of the scenarios I’ve presented? I’d be grateful. I’d really like to understand more. This is not an attack on any individual faith, or any faith; it is merely a request for clarity. It is not a sign of disrespect. It’s a question that I feel it’s reasonable to ask. Surely?\nTo presume to know the answers God (I’m talking about the Christian God here) would give to any given question would be to claim to have the attributes of God yourself. Your assumptions, although amicable, are limited and impossible to conclude justice from.\nFurther, as an atheist, your own world view militates against you making any moral judgement, as you cannot make claim to moral absolutes, but instead are subjective morally. You do make moral judgements however, borrowing from the Christian tradition. You live in truth, yet deny it with your atheism.\nScenario 1. A. Continental drift, according to scientists, facilitated life on this planet. Without such a natural force we wouldn’t exist at all. B. God is the posthumous judge. Justice, as you’d no doubt agree, doesn’t pan out in our early lives. Sans God, life is unfair.\nScenario 2. Why do you assume that an answer to prayer has to be in the affirmative? Do you know the mind of God? On what grounds do you question his judgement? What knowledge do you possess that would surpass his?\nScenario 3. Your efforts are as filthy rags. The gift freely given is for you to accept. There is no “good Christian”. We’re all sinners in the sight of God, fallen creatures.\nGod is necessarily love and truth. He has implanted in every heart the desire for him. We all know him already, we just deny him.\nIt is a reasonable set of questions to ask. God provides a reasonable explanation. Atheism provides an absurd explanation. How can you be satisfied with that? Your world is full of pain and suffering and has no explanation for any of it. Who cares… is your logical response. Your actual response?\nLikeLike\nhow sad to live life believing you are born of sin and have to spend your life repenting and that God on a whim can elect to care or not, have you suffer or not, irrespective of how much you pray or how moral and ‘christian’ a life you lead. Children born with horrific diseases, whole countries watching their families and friends and chidren die of famine. Thousands suffer from a cancer , the one of the thousand that ‘has his prayers answered’ praises god, yet what of the others. The one survivor of 9/11 praising Lord for his salvation, what about the other good Christians he left to perish and the good Christian families he left parentless, husbandless, wifeless\nwe will never agree. I will always view the worshipping of words written by man and changed by man when they no longer suit, in the name of a prophet, to be absurd and you will always think the opposite.. thank goodnes we live in a democratic and free country where Christians no longer feel the need to kill anyone they can’t convert. And lets hope that your Christian prophet is the true one and you are not making a terrible mistake offending the real one.\nThank you for taking the time to post your response.\nLikeLike\n“how sad to live life believing you are born of sin and have to spend your life repenting and that God on a whim can elect to care or not, have you suffer or not, irrespective of how much you pray or how moral and ‘christian’ a life you lead.”\nDo you think we are born perfect or imperfect RTR? If you think that you’re not perfect, then you are acknowledging the Christian premise, that were are all imperfect. Not a problem for the atheist, because this is an unjust world.\nThankfully I don’t have to spend my life repenting, out trying to make up for the injustice, because in the Christian tradition, God paid our price for us so we are completely forgiven. You are forgiven too, as it’s a few gift to everyone. So the answer to the question seems to be on the other foot… how do you bear the never ending injustice that you witness in this world. My heart goes out to you.\nLove to you\nLikeLike\nhaha, bless you. I don’t need forgiving for my sins. Because I take responsibility for them myself. If I do something bad i deserve to be punished for it and i don’t want to go to jail or be unhappy so i try and lead a good life. .\nHow do you bear the never ending injustices of the world – war, famine, disease, crime… more importantly how about the innocent victims of rapist, peadophilees, bullies, …. Are they all equal in the eyes of god and will seek their punishmet in hell but are free to torment the good and innocent in life. Those victims of crime – should we accept that its as it is but will be OK because in Heaven they will be rewarded…. and the families and friends of the innocent who suffer….\nI look forward to when we next find a spot of common ground on which to stand together…. maybe our love of writing\nLikeLike\nI cope with the suffering in the world because in my reality, with a loving and just God, justice is always served in this world and the next.\nYour world without God is unjust. Simple as that.\nLikeLike\n“haha, bless you. I don’t need forgiving for my sins. Because I take responsibility for them myself. If I do something bad i deserve to be punished for it and i don’t want to go to jail or be unhappy so i try and lead a good life. .”\nYour imperfection is not correctable though is it? What God says is that you can be forgiven/ ie not punished for that.\nLiving above the law is a poor substitute for living blame free. Your sins condemn you to self inflicted misery.\nWe all try to live above the law because it is our in our self interest. You can’t buy your lost innocence by your own efforts.\nI get the feeling that you’re denying what I’m saying because of some preconceived ideas about religion. I’ve answered all of your questions and you’re ignoring them. Preferring instead to repeat the statements.\nYou can lead a horse to water… 🙂\nI don’t know why you don’t want to discuss what you asked to discuss a few times here, but I respect your wish not to discuss.\nApologies for going on. This will be my last comment unless you invite further discussion.\nLove to you\nLikeLike\ncheck out some of my writing if your interested in philosophy, input would be much appreciated 🙂\nLikeLike\ni will do – thanks\nLikeLike\nas a Theist, The presence of the words I and god near each other displays a neurotic and self centered view on spirituality. I’m not a theist in the strictest sense of the word but at some level I believe that consciousness is IT and that something Other exists and holds all Being at its core. The universe needing to observe itself through eyes ears etc… So when i see an internal dialect such as the ones above, I see someone not so much interested in theology, or spirituality, or even religion at the shallowest level, but actually interested in self preservation and self fulfillment, one wallowed in self pity and fear.\nThen again I don’t believe in the old bearded god who obsessed with humans- a speck on an infinite plane.\nLikeLike\nthank you so much for taking the time to both read and reply to this blog. I am particularly interested in your last line and agree wholeheartedly than its inconceivable to have one beardy ‘human’ looking being overseeing every action of man and obsessing about what they say and think. The universe is too large ! I’m going to check out your blog and read more from you about consciousness.\nLikeLike\nAny time, always a pleasure to contribute\nLikeLike",

In recognition of it eccentric history , pastimes and general obsession with joviality; the events over the weekend include a Fancy Dress Ball ”May the Fourth Be With You” . Free entry to hours and hours of great live music hosted at the Neuadd Arms Hotel with the added entertainment of individuals dressed for Star Wars meets Loony on the Sunday Evening.\nA couple of local ladies have taken advantage of this madness to have their heads shaved in order to donate their hair to the Little Princess Trust. June Duncan (62), of New Hall Guest House and Jenny Walsby (50), of Home Stays at Lledgwial decided to grow their hair when Bernice Benton (46) of Cerdyn Villa, suggested raising money and awareness of the charity back in May 2013. The charity sources and gives beautiful real-hair wigs to children who have lost their own hair, primarily through cancer treatment and The Little Princess Trust accepts hair donations (minimum length 7″). So, June and Jenny will have their hair tied in a ponytail which will be snipped off ,to send away, then friend Tina will use hair croppers to tidy what’s left.\nIn addition they will be passing the collection buckets and sponsorship forms to the party goers at the fancy dress ball and asking them to support their challenge and Berni’s pending involvement in this year’s (the 7th) annual Pink Car Rally which takes place in early September..\nJune Duncan has lived in Llanwrtyd for 8 years and embraced its event-led tourism agenda from day one. She told us “ Llanwrtyd has given me the opportunity to celebrate by inner child. It’s a great place for people who love to embrace their individuality. The things I’ve been involved in since moving here have been amazing” . Back in August 2009 June stood on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square to represent the town and its infamous sport of Bog Snorkelling. She spent her hour up there dressed in lime green lycra with a bike helmet based frog head, green tutu and umbrella , beside a toilet (!!) – representing herself as the mascot “Bog Frog”.. and definitely putting the town boldly onto the map.\nJenny, who came to Llanwrtyd in 3 years ago is in the process of setting up an eco campsite in the grounds of her B&B. She too couldn’t help but become actively involved in the towns tourism credentials, helping to develop their quarterly Farmers & Crafts Markets, a food fair for this coming summer and taking on the organising of the 2014 Bog Series on behalf of Green Events Ltd as part of the 2014 World Alternative Games.\nJenny told us “As an in-comer to Llanwrtyd you are revitalised by the energy of the many event companies, wacky activity organisers and enthusiasm of the community to engage in voluntary groups to look after and develop the town. It’s such a fun place to live and getting involved certainly keeps us busy!”\nThis is the 3rd year that the Neuadd Arms has hosted the Heart of Wales Music Festival (Music Madness and MAYhem) supported by Sir Dangerous Dave ex of Screaming Lord Sutch’s “Savages” and performing as lead on Sunday for The Pistol Riders; and Catrin O’Neill, talented folk singer/guitarist from North Wales.\nSaturday will be a folk/roots evening featuring George Breakfast, followed by Catrin O’Neill with Mike Lease, and culminating with the Fluid Druids (a trio including a mix of guitar, cittern, pipes, fiddle, flute and voice).

I welcome the challenges, thought processes, analysis and outcomes of these. Sometimes my views express those of the majority, sometimes not. Sometimes they raise awareness of situations that others may not, but would benefit from being aware of or having the opportunity to comment on, sometimes not. Sometimes I come away with a changed opinion on receipt of new information and different viewpoints. Often I come away wiser.\n“People always have an opinion. Doesn’t mean it’s right, doesn’t mean it’s wrong, but we have to respect their opinion.” – Michael Clarke Duncan\nVery rarely do I take a difference of view as a personal affront. Democracy and life in a free state encourage this. Friendship and business allow for and compromise this. I have many friends with different views to me on many topics, including ‘the biggies’ – you know, the ones that should be avoided at dinner parties – politics, religion, sexual preferences. I actually enjoy these topics over a meal, but only if those I’m with can accept alternative positions (excuse the pun to point 3!) without being personally offended. No-one wants to upset friends so sometimes it is prudent to agree to differ and avoid those topics.\n“Truth is one forever absolute, but opinion is truth filtered through the moods, the blood, the disposition of the spectator.” – Wendell Phillips\nHowever in business and community issues there are often times when differences in opinion and preferred outcome need to be vociferously defended or challenged.\n“If you take a strong stance and have a clear opinion or statement on any subject …, you’re going to polarize people. And without that polarity, there’s no discussion. Discussion is what I want, which means that I’m fine with the consequences.” –Tim Ferriss\nFor various reasons this last 12 months or so have seen this arise on a few occasions. Sadly, despite the intention to the contrary, some professional people have chosen to take the challenges personally. It’s very sad to see people still angry and offended by issues that were not personally theirs to start with, long after the issue has been resolved or forgotten. These issues were challenged on principal and prospective outcome rather than attacks on any individuals personality.\n“I love argument, I love debate. I don’t expect anyone just to sit there and agree with me, that’s not their job.” – Margaret Thatcher\nOver time, changes in priority, personnel, the arrival of new issues and (to be honest) downright boredom to continue, seem to have begun to bring forth a more relaxed, commonsense and balanced dialogue. Plus, I’m glad to say, the majority of the people involved, and certainly those whose input, views, actions and opinions I respect, have returned to, or remained on friendly, polite and respectful terms. Despite the ongoing difference of opinion on the subjects concerned. We have (and, here we show evidence of effective democratic process) reached a point where we can move on having resolved some issues, bypassed others and decided that some are simply not important enough to continue expending energy on.\n“What we have to do… is to find a way to celebrate our diversity and debate our differences without fracturing our communities.” – Hilary Clinton\nI hope we have all learned lessons, moved forward, and come out of the debate with our consciences intact our honour upheld and our understanding of each other all the greater.\nRemember, for every war the ‘good guys’ are those on whose side you are sat, the enemy is always the opposing side!\n“Everything we hear is an opinion, not fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.” – Marcus Aurelius\nWe should never be afraid of speaking our minds or stand up on issues that we feel important. But we should also remember to realise that not everyone will have the same view but we can all live together despite our differences and sometimes, we should celebrate those differences.\n“If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.” – John Stuart Mill",

My head is fucking screaming. I feel like I’m going crazy. Seriously WHAT THE FUCK!!!!\nminor operation Monday morning last. sinuses. no big deal. Twenty minutes under a general anesthetic. Discharged the next morning. Warned of occasional nose bleeds. Handed a batch of pain relief meds, some swabs, a letter for my doctor, advice on how to ‘nasal douche’, and told to not do anything too strenuous for a couple of weeks.\nOkey dokey. Piece of piss.\nWRONG!\nWHO THE FUCK forgot to mention , never mind understated, the after effects of general anesthetic. Even the little bitty one I had. FOR FUCKS SAKE!

Not because the person died. Or even because we fell out (although I suspect we have); but because the person I thought he was turns out to be a lie. Maybe not a total lie but a mish-mash of truth, non-truth, fabrication, fantasy and lies so deeply intertwined that unravelling the reality would be impossible.\nI dated someone like this once. I’d forgotten about it actually, perhaps the intense pain of it had been locked deep inside my internal filing system, locked with the key thrown away. But the issues raised this week have forced open that lock; and with the advancement of my years; the lessons and experiences of various friends and more reading, I now recognise that the relationship I was in was unhealthy and that this person, whilst I am not one of the ones in a relationship with him, still exhibits the behaviour patterns.\nMaybe I’m being melodramatic but I think that these days they might recognise it as “gaslighting”. Gaslighting is defined as “to manipulate someone by psychological means into doubting their own sanity (own truth)”\nIt’s about the ability to baffle your mind. Mixing moments of shared truth with detailed fabrication. The fabrication parts go into such depth and intertwine themselves with the bits you know to be true , this together with your love and trust for that person, your own sense of reality is lost.\nThe person will also take offence at your unwillingness to believe them; or be upset that you might question a representation of the truth that they present. They won’t like you talking to other people they are close to (as you might hear something different from them). They will show so much compassion and concern at your subsequent confusion that you might wonder whether it is you being overly jealous; or maybe your memory of events is wrong; or maybe you are even mentally unwell.\nThis man from my past told me he loved me, behaved as if he loved me, spoke to me often and shared the intimate details of his past. But he intertwined the truth of his life with detailed stories and complex lies. We met abroad, he was working there, I was backpacking. We were together over a year. His truth that I knew was he had an ex in his home country. I knew they had a child, According to him she had been his childhood sweetheart but they had grown up and grown apart, their relationship was long over but he still saw and loved his son so they did see one another. I had never asked to visit him at his home or meet any of his family least of all his son. He instigated all that. He wanted to fly me there, introduce me to his parents; meet his son. To demonstrate he was serious he would phone me from a phone box (pre mobiles!!!) whilst with his toddler and have me talk to the child on the phone. He’d repeatedly tell me how he couldn’t wait for me to meet him..\nThe truth… my ticket never materialised. She, his ex, was expecting their second child. Turns out he had several other women too. some drunken sex others probably in the same boat as me. Friends told me he had flings but he denied it;I thought I knew him; I didn’t see what was staring me in the face. These and so many other things, should have been signs. They weren’t. Love truly is blind.\nAnyway, this is not something that has happened to me again but it is something I have seen happening to friends in the past .\nSadly, it is now something I see happening to a couple of female friends who I know (because of him) and the perpetrator is a man I thought was something else. He’s not. It’s so sad because I really thought he was one of life’s rare, truly good guys. It’s weird because I’m mourning the loss of a friendship. I am in the cross fire of a situation I never wanted to be in and I don’t know how to handle it. Part of me wants to ignore it and not lose my friend but I know too much that now I know what he has done we can never have the same friendship again. Maybe we will have a friendship of sorts, it would be easier to have than not in a small community and with shared friendship circles, but that easy banter and easy access will never be there again. Whatever the relationship becomes, it, like him, will be a fake. I miss him.\nIt’s so hard when you think you know someone and it turns out to be lies. I am also experiencing this at the moment – a friend who seemed so honest and genuine, whom I have known for about 6 years, has suddenly been exposed – she has been stealing from me and some of my other friends. It’s very difficult to come to terms with. And I’m sorry that you are having to go through this for the second time. #blogcrush\nLikeLike",

The weather doesn’t help. But here in Llanwrtyd Wells we have the cure. This weekend (the second one in January) every year we hold the World Mountain Bike Chariot Racing and the Roman Saturnalia Feast and Party\nThere’s nothing quite like dressing in a skirt when the temperatures dip below freezing!\nThe premise is 2 mountain bikes, joined by fixed t-bar with an oil drum chariot at the back; teams of 3 race round the circuit in heats of 4 chariots a time. Each heat winner moves to the next round until we have our finalists. The final, as if the racers are not wet and muddy enough, comprises two laps.\nIn the evening at Green Events H/Q, also head office of the Brecknockshire Branch of the Monster Raving Loony Party, there is a toga party complete with Roman Feast.\nSadly you’ve missed your chance this year but there’s always 2019… enough time to get fitted for your Centurion outfit and find yourself a team. Join us and wash away the winter blues with a fun packed weekend of crazy in the UK’s smallest town.\nThe World Mountain Bike Chariot Racing is the first event of the year run by Green Events Ltd, throughout the year they run a calendar of events, both quirky and mainstream, including World Bog Snorkelling, Real Ale Wobble, Man v Horse Marathon and Real Ale Ramble. Bi-annually in the same small town of Llanwryd Wells, Powys you can find the 2 week festival of the World Alternative Games\nThis sounds so much fun! What a great way of getting your community together #thesatsesh\nLikeLike\nWow – you sure know how to continue partying in January in your part of the world! What a fab thing to do! #thesatsesh xx\nLikeLike\nThat could have been a great event!\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2017_02_12_migraines/content_19.html": "How many of you suffer from migraines? Do you find their arrival predictable? Do you have a recognised set of symptoms?\nPersonally I usually get mine at the beginning of or during my period (a common trigger apparently). They begin with a mild headache that will not shake when normally a couple of paracetamol will quash it. By the time I realise I’m getting a migraine there’s nothing I can do because I can’t keep anything down.\nThe headache takes on a pressure that makes my head and neck so heavy. My head throbs, my cheeks ache, my gums are painful, my eyes feel like they are bulging. I then become supersensitive to light, movement and noise. The pressure on my head makes me feel nauseous. The only release is to vomit. Thus starts a cycle of vomiting and agonising pain throbbing throughout my head,neck and face. A dark quiet room is not dark enough or quiet enough. I need a slight weight on my head and eyes so I put on an eye mask and I put on a hat or a compress. I climb into bed in between trips to the bathroom to be sick and ride it out for about 8 hours. Then I sleep.\nThe next day I am flimsy, that’s the best word I can come up with. I feel very shaky and fragile. I feel like I could use a head and neck brace… I feels I can barely support my own head without help. I’m not sensitive to input but unable to keep up with it. I certainly am not safe to drive. It’s like my eyes and ears see or hear something and there is a notable delay in processing. That means I can cope with a small amount of input but if things happen too fast I can’t cope at all.\nI know that the following morning the world will be ‘normal’ again.\nDo any of you have regular, or predictable migraine symptoms? What are they? How do you deal with them?\nYes! Mine usually start as soon as I wake up… It begins with a feeling of pressure around my sinuses and then gradually worsens to a full blown migraine at the end of the day! Usually they go away at around 7pm. Mine don’t correlate with my period at all, although I’ve heard that happens for a lot of women.\nLikeLike",

  "https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_/https_rosetintedramblings_wordpress_com_2014_01_24_a-weekend-away/content_1790.html": "Last weekend I went to visit my bestest friend . I am 46 . I have been friends with Sue since I was 16 and began dating her son… Sometimes friendships don’t happen where you’d expect them. Some years later I split from her son (after the most lovely 3 year relationship) and she split from his dad (after 18 or so years of marriage). That was 30 years ago. At first we used to hit the singles scene together – parties, nightclubs and the like and shop. a lot.\nI now live here in the middlest of Mid Wales and she still lives in the South Downs in a pretty little village with a pub and a post box. Actually it no longer has the post box.\nSo, we don’t get to see each other that much but with all the access through social media and phone we tend to know whats going on and keep in touch remotely. Lots of FB messaging and the occasional very long phone conversation. As such, when we do get together it tends to be both really really lovely, AND for a few days .\nI went by train (I love using the Heart of Wales Line). with little effort and almost no stress. I went from here to Swansea, Swansea to Paddington, St Pancras to Luton. We shopped in Luton, drank coffee and chatted before going home and spending many hours chatting shit, laughing and unpicking each others problems – you know girlie stuff, spilling the beans. Next day we did more catching up and then on Monday we headed to Interior UK 204. She was working on her companies stand and I had booked a ticket as proprietor of our guesthouse as it was a trade fair rather than one open to the public. What a treat for me.\nApart from the excessive heat and the aching feet, I had a really great day. Five halls showcasing interiors : furniture, lighting, contemporary design, fabrics and wall coverings, art and accessories.\nMy highlights:\nOut of the Dark, “recycling, restoring and revamping of salvaged furniture as a means to train, educate and employ young people from disadvantaged backgrounds” We all know the usual revamping – shabby chic, decoupage etc – this lot did it differently. The showcase stand was a project in conjunction with four designers and funded by the NEC\nMore Than Bags ltd-a company based in Angelsey (yeah Wales!) – fantastic light fittings using embroidered papers, fabrics and gorgeous woods\nS Boads, showcasing his handmade lighting -lush lush lush – I must get one\nYulia Badian (Silk Felt Impossible Interiors) and her delicious and opulent silk/felt work. I cannot gush enough about her Woodland Boudoir Installation\nMystique Wholesale, there were several stands using this technique , creating liquid art framed prints but there’s (in my opinion) was by far the best and I loved some of their funky floor lamps\nand finally….\nBarnhaus– I went to the seminar and it was great. Architect based in Cardiff (again ,Wales yeah!), he was the winner of a competition issued by The National Self Build Association (NSBA) in conjunction with Grand Designs to design a home you under 50K that can be self built. I could tell you more but why not take a look yourself. social housing, Eco-housing, zero-carbon solutions awesome!\njust for fun here are a few other pics of favourite objects:",

I still don’t know if it was decided what the collective noun for a gathering of Loonies should be but in my own rose-tinted world I elect to call them a Laughter of Loonies. Fitting tribute as I cannot remember when i laughed for so long and so hard.\nWhich is saying something because I like to laugh. And I laugh A LOT. Big, loud, raucous. Full on , unabashed , no holds barred. And for that I must apologise for the rest of the residents of the New Guilderoy Hotel !\nAlthough to be fair , the hotel is Loony run… by the fabulous Lord Guilderoy and our Party Chief Whip\nThey very kindly found a small corner for us Loony Sistas to costume change and refresh throughout the weekend so we could attend the annual Monster Raving Loony Party Conference. The New Guilderoy is an eclectic mix of decades and objet d’art. The whole building and welcome was a delightful surprise, a joyful eccentricity and the perfect home to host a bus load of Loons. And the breakfast… well… it saved the days after the nights before. Thank you , thank you, thank you.\nSo what is involved in a Monster Raving Loony Party Conference?\nFirstly there’s the members ‘Meet and Greet’ , this year at Uncle Toms Cabin… (what a great team they have there – the staff were AWESOME)\nThen there’s the Party bus tour to Meet the Electorate….\nFollowed by the Leaders Speech and Cabinet Reshuffle….\nThen there’s the conference (over a pint in Uncle Toms Cabin)… plans for the Welsh Assembly Elections next May… sorry , no cameras allowed in the conference room !\nAnd, finally, we can all relax.

Time out was required and it had to involve minimal time on the roads. Hence our wonderfully easy and pain free travel from Cardiff to Rome using Flybe\nAnd even though I am sat writing this at Bistro Fiumicino because of a 2HR 20MIN delay for the flight home., I still feel pretty chilled. Fiumicino airport is light bright and airy. Flybe advised us of the delay straight away (although not the reason) and provided vouchers for food and drink. And we’ve (have Hubby in tow) just spent 4 wonderful days in THE most amazing capital city. Plus, when we do eventually touch down in the UK, it will be in Cardiff which is a teeny-weeny easy- peasy airport to navigate and a simple bus transfer to our sons house before a relatively short, but certainly straightforward drive home.\nSo, the reason for the delay was not the weather in Cardiff.. I thought this a bit odd because, at worst, Cardiff weather might be a bit ‘dreary’… I mean it was pretty improbably that Hurricane Blodwen had hit.\nI found out because of the prompt (and unexpected ) response I received to a tweet I made to Flybe\nSo ‘Thankyou’ Sophie from Flybe. Problems can’t always be avoided. Sometimes they happen and it’s how we handle them that matters. This is when a company can shine or fall flat on it’s face. It’s that monumental component of business that most businesses throw by the wayside in their pursuit of new customers and profits. However, keeping an existing customer is much more cost effective and I’ll cerainly be using Flybe again.

One of them being, ‘get more organised’! I was INSPIRED at the time by Debbie of My Random Musings to write down measurable, realistic yet Aspiring goals to FOCUS my mind on my art and my social media. My plan was to review my own progress and tweak my activity throughout the year to meet or even succeed my targets (arbitary numbers that I liked the sound of).\nIn the original post which you can read in full by following the link I set myself targets relating to Twitter, blogging, teaching, making stock items, obtaining art commissions,, obtaining exhibitions, vlogging and setting up retreats and events at our B&B, Cerdyn Villa.\nIn August I did my first quarterly review. Seemingly I still had more work to do on the ‘get more organised’ resolution! I was pretty pleased with my progress, some targets had been exceeded, others were in my sights; but a couple had lost direction completely. I resolved to resolve these issues. Four months left to get full marks in my end of year review. In October I blogged an update and sadly the same weak spots remained.\nSo all in all how did 2017 go for me?\nAside from the goals set. 2017 can best be described as BLOODY FANTASTIC.\nA year full of joy and laughter, friendship and parties. I had a massive celebration on reaching my half century in tact; Hubby and I became grandparents.\nBut lets focus on the 2017 challenges I set myself\n1. Twitter – 500 followers : as of today I have 574… I notice that I picked a realistic 500 but had a wild dream of 1000. I think to achieve that I need a course. I need to know how to use lists and analyse my stats. I suspect in 2018 the important thing should be concentrating on engagement and interaction rather than followers. No point in getting 1000 likes if only 6 people ever ‘speak’ to me. Any tips and recommendations people?\n2. Sort out my twitter lists. – well I did, but now feel like I need to split them and review them. I also need to know how to make use of them because I’m sure twitter would be a more useful tool if I had some more skills knowledge. I suspect there are loads more I can do with it than I can do now.. so 2018 is about LEARNING and APPLYING that learning to achieve more meaningful INTERACTION\n3 & 4. Blog – 150 followers / 20,000 views… well I have 143 followers and 17796 views – I need to work harder at the blog … problem is I don’t know what I want to achieve with it. I write for my sanity. As I have said many times it’s my place to ‘brain dump’, sometimes posts never get published. Would I want blogging to be a money spinner for me rather than a social and mental outlet? I am a little reticent, I generally scan over or don’t read sponsored blog posts. I’m a skeptic, I don’t watch adverts. If someone is being paid to like a product, how do I know they really like it, or really like it more than any similar product. In an ideal world I’d like to continue to write what wanted about anything I wanted to AND earn money from it…hey, wouldn’t we all. It would make me feel less guilty about the amount of time I spend writing and reading blogs. At the moment as we edge into 2018, it remains my guilty pleasure. I have a feeling it may stay that way\n5. Teaching – I spent the first 6 months of 2017 co-teaching a fantastic community stained glass project in Myddfai. As a result of that I had the opportunity to co-run three one day stained glass workshops. Incentivised by this I have ‘tidied’ (inverted commas as it’s already messy again) my home studio with a view to running private and small group workshops in 2018. Problem is I can’t work out the structure, format and how to promote them. I’d like to offer bespoke sessions to 1-4 people; tailored to the level and desires of the individuals attending. How do you price that? A one day workshop could include lunch. Maybe somehow I can incorporate our B&B business; that is, to offer stained glass breaks or artistic retreats. So a 2 night package with a day and a half of workshops including lunches. Our B&B can take a max of 8 people. Perhaps I should engage with other creatives so there is a choice of activities, eg photography safaris, watercolour / knitting /needle felting workshops. A build your own break type scenario. I feel I need find another course to teach me how to progress with this idea. Is there a course out there to teach me how to package, price and promote?\n6. I got caught out in 2016 by promoting my stained glass light catcher designs but not making any ahead of time. Orders normally trickle in and I make to order. As an artist I prefer the one offs and commissions; on a commercial basis (I suck at being commercially viable) I should have a number of units of each of my own designs already made for times like say, Christmas, especially if I plan to shout about it. Anyway my challenge was to start making Christmas stock in August. Did I? Did I heck!!! So this year I simply didn’t advertise either, so as a result hardly sold anything too.\n7. I wanted to have new stained glass standard designs in my portfolio so I set my sights on creating two new designs. I didn’t do it. Full stop. No comment\n8. I aimed to get 3 commissions in 2017. Interesting one this. I did get asked for more than three but none of them came to fruition. Problem is with 3 of them I spent a lot of time doing the design work and getting it approved without charging for the design phase. I do however suspect that at least one of the three might well happen in 2018. In addition I was commissioned to make 3 other much smaller bespoke stained glass items. Two were for before Christmas, one is for sometime in the first quarter of 2018. I also had a painting commission I thought had fallen by the wayside. I’d written it off but in December they confirmed with me. I have until November 2018 to do it and the recipient is paying a deposit before I start and making monthly payments towards the finished painting throughout the year. So what have I learned? Again, I need to be more business like in my approach. I need a charge card and I need to take some money up front. If I am going to spend time doing designs I need to charge for them. They take a lot of time. Plus if they invest in the process from the beginning they are more likely to be genuine and more likely to follow through. The other issue I have is under charging / undervaluing my services. One commission, were I to be asked to do similar again, would definitely be three times the price I charged. How does one value oneself? Especially when the items being made are one offs , made to order. Perhaps there’s a course I can go on for this too ?\n9. Run a retreat at our B&B – didn’t happen. Not been forgotten. I refer back to 5. and 8.\n10. Complete 2 more paintings in my sky-scape series and exhibit. Job done. Four more paintings, three glass installations and an exhibition with the preview set for 12th January 2018. My first ever solo exhibition. Despite it being in a small, local venue I am bricking it. Thank goodness for supportive friends.\n11. Facebook. I wanted to increase likes/following of our combined B&B and my arts page to 1000. In the end I decided to split the two back up. It was all getting too confusing. So this is where you find Cerdyn Villa B&B with its 375 followers and Berni Benton Art and Glass with its 753 followers. I do suspect however that whilst followers may be important, I should be concentrating more on understanding my stats and looking at interaction and engagement. I should also be trying to actively generate commissions and bookings from these pages, particularly as my websites are redundant/none existent. Yet again, there must be a course that I can attend to improve and develop these skills.\n12. start Vlogging. ….well….. I did one. better add it to my 2018 list.\nSo for 2017 three key doing words to work by: focus, aspire, inspire\nThey’re good valid words that helped me move forward and progress\nMy work mantra for 2018…\nLEARNING, APPLICATION, INTERACTION\n… Meanwhile I shall carry along my life with LOVE, LAUGH, LIVE\nWhat words are you living and working by in the coming year?\nHAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE\nMay your futures be full of love, peace, happiness, laughter and prosperity xxxxx\nSounds like a totally epic year! I’ve yet to meet anyone who achieved all they set out to – they’re goals, they’re something to aim for, you can’t score every time 🙂\nI like your words…not thought of my blog words for 2018, but I’ve got one for me, and that is ‘Respect’ – I need to respect myself, my ideas, and other people a bit more. #BlogCrush\nLikeLike\nI love to simplify my overall plan with two or three positive words. Respect is a great one. We so often forget to include ourselves\nLikeLike\nLove the stained glass! Congrats on becoming Grandparents!\nMake sure you have You time in 2018!\n#BlogCrush\nLikeLike\nthanks Matthew\nLikeLike",
