The PIPI entailed the amalgamation of the BRAMMT model feeding into the PERMA model over a 8 week duration. The PIPI was implemented using the autoenthnography qualitative method to reflect upon cultural, political and social meaningful experiences of COVID-19. The Positive Integrated Psychology Intervention (PIPI) provided a Positive Well being Platform for the acquisition of Positive Adaptive flourishing behaviours to unravel. The PIPI was facilitated by the DAW hypothesis deepening and widening process allowing the Dual-system model to advocate the whole intervention within a systematic framework. The outcome was indeed very much a deepening and wideing experience with the reinforcment of experiences steering the Dual-system model of adaptation towards a notion of Optimal levels of human functioning.\nKEYWORDS: Positive Integrated Psychology Intervention, Autoenthnography, DAW Hypothesis, COVID-19, BRAMMT, PERMA, Dual-System model of adaptation.\nFiles coming soon.\nPositive Wellbeing Association\nWe use cookies to analyze website traffic and optimize your website experience.
