While The City has been open since July, many companies and individuals have seen September as the start of a new ‘year’ post summer and post pandemic (in so far as that can be said to be the case).\nMarking the more formal return to the office in line with the school year is fitting. The City of London might be associated with working environments, but its excellence is rooted in a tradition for supporting education and training, from school all the way into the professional working environment. The City of London Academies Trust alone currently oversees four secondary academies, three primary academies and one sixth form centre, and recently announced plans to open two new sixth forms in Hackney (Highgate Hill) and Islington (Shoreditch Park) in 2022.\nThat tradition is more important than ever as we seek to reinforce the City and its importance on the global stage following Brexit, as well as looking to the years ahead after Covid-19 and any long-term damage it could result in for those starting their careers.\nSupporting young people starting their careers\nTo date, the City has attracted up to a quarter of all UK graduates into its jobs. In the most recent Business Register and Employment Survey, it showed that 542,000 people are employed in the City of London - that’s one in 57 GB workers.\nI think that those of us currently in the City have a very important role to play in helping young people to find their futures. The way we work post-pandemic has to be considered as a part of this. We can, and do, support young people starting their careers in a number of ways. It can be in the form of different types of training, mentoring, and being cognisant of the variety of opportunities that are available in different types of business. It’s the variety that is important to attract different people with different skills.\nOne way that’s happening is in the ongoing growth in degree apprenticeship schemes; it’s a very attractive and supportive route for those who are clear about where they want to go. I also think the value of mentoring can’t be underestimated for ongoing personal development. I don’t just mean in terms of formal mentoring programs, but in the community nature of the City.\nAs I look back over 30 years of working I can think of three or four individuals who have gently mentored me and who I can turn to in the various communities that I exist in, and how important that guidance is for people at any age. For those in the position of mentor, it’s also enormously satisfying to be able to pay forward everything that the City has provided to them as well.\nTraining and the question of remote working\nThe question of remote working and how it fits into the post pandemic environment is an ongoing debate. Everyone has a nuanced opinion on it depending on what they do, the stage of their career and what their home working environment is like. From what I can see so far, there’s space for both office working and remote working and as time goes on, fear subsides and technology continues to evolve, those views will no doubt continue to develop as well.\nOne area in which this has proven really tricky is when it comes to training junior members of staff. While formal training is comparatively easy to implement online, it’s the less tangible learning by osmosis that has suffered.\nI think the only definitive thing on this front is that it’s important for all of us to remember that we’re not going ‘back’ to the old normal. We have to create a new shared future and think collectively about what companies are going to do. In the past we went to the City as that’s where we met one another, before that it developed because people lived there or close by. Now, we need to think about how we keep that soul of the City and retain the serendipitous value of being physically present, but also best use alternative ways of working as well.\nMaking sure the doors are open and visible\nOne of the best things that the City has to offer is its heritage. The foundations of the City can be used as inspiration for its future identity.\nConsider the story of Dick Whittington, who came to a City where ‘the streets were paved with gold’. The fictionalised version of the former Lord Mayor’s story tells us that this is a place where anyone with aptitude and ambition will be well received, able to contribute and succeed. This has long been a central tenet of the City - that it’s not just about inherited establishment wealth; it’s a place where people can come and prove themselves whatever class, shape, colour, gender, or ethnicity they may be. This has been the case, and it must be the same going forward.\nWith this in mind, there is a lot that the City does to encourage and support individuals who want to explore opportunities in The City, but who may have felt marginalised or unable to do so. The Diversity Project and the #10000BLACKINTERNS initiative are just two examples, but we need to ensure people are aware of the opportunities in order to access them in the first place.\nIn short, I think the City’s role in developing talent is more important and more exciting than ever, with many passionate people building on a history of ingenuity and collaboration to ensure a positive future. The doors remain open wide, we just need to make sure that they are also visible to anyone who wants to walk through them.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_the-mayflower/content_35.html": "26 November 2020\nThe Mayflower...\n...and a Cheapside Haberdasher's involvement\nIt is a privilege to be a Court Member in The Haberdasher's Company which is one of the Great Twelve Livery Companies and has a long history closely connected to the development of the City of London and perhaps unknown to many, an important involvement in the famed voyage of The Mayflower.\nDr David Bartle, Archivist of The Haberdasher's recently shared this fascinating story of Cheapside, the City and of course the New World.\n“But then the Merchant Adventurers will just pull out and withdraw their money”………[Words of Edward Winslow, Pilgrim on the Mayflower in a Play (2020 production) by Kate Price, Freeman of the Company]\nThe planned City of London and countrywide celebrations for Mayflower 400 (the 400th Anniversary of the sailing of the Mayflower) have sadly all become victims of the Covid19 pandemic. Several initiatives that the Company was planning in support of the events (such as a play about the voyage) have had to be shelved. But the main finding made during research for the events was the prominent role of one of our members at the time; his story is told in what follows.\nThe Mayflower set sail on 16th September 1620 from Plymouth, UK, to voyage to America, known to English explorers at the time as the New World. Its passengers were in search of a new life – some seeking religious freedom, others a fresh start in a different land. They would go on to be known as the Pilgrim Fathers and influence the future of the United States of America in ways they could never have imagined. More than 30 million people today can trace their ancestry to the 102 passengers and approximately 30 crew who were aboard the Mayflower when it landed in Plymouth Bay, Massachusetts.\nA significant number were identifiable as Separatists, a group of people who mostly wanted to live a life free from the current Church of England. Others were on the ship for a multitude of reasons – some anticipated the chance to build a better future for their families and the opportunity of new land, while for others the offer of freedom and adventure was too good to turn down.\nThe territory of Virginia in America was an attractive destination because several colonies had already attempted settlement there. However, the pilgrims also felt that they should not settle too near to any existing groups and risk ending up with a similar religious environment from which they originally fled.\nThe pilgrims wanted to work with like-minded Separatists in England to fund and organise their journey – which had to make commercial sense. And they began negotiations with such merchants in London through the Guild of Merchant Adventurers of London and convinced them that funding their journey would see a significant return on investment thanks to the luxury products, such as furs, they would be able to send back to England.\nThe Haberdashers’ Company like the other City Liveries did not take up direct involvement with the Mayflower pilgrims. But in the case of the Haberdashers, there was an involvement through one of our members, Richard Andrews, who became a major personal benefactor of the voyage and was a sympathetic Separatist in his religious views. In fact, Richard Andrews was one of the wealthiest and most liberal of these London-based Merchant Adventurers.\nRichard was originally a trading Haberdasher of Cheapside in the City of London and a Court Member of the Haberdashers’ Company: he had received his Freedom of the City in 1606.\nSo it was that in 1619, a group of merchant adventurers including Richard Andrews gathered in London to consider financing a voyage to Plymouth Plantation. This was specifically to be an investment in the voyage of the Mayflower, through the entreaty of the pilgrims intent on going.\nBy 1624 four of the original Adventurers, including Richard Andrews, sent a statement of affairs to the Plymouth colony explaining why most of the original merchant adventurer backers had given up due to losses at sea and failed profits. They asked that after the colonists’ needs were filled that ”you gather together such commodities as ye cuntrie yields and send them over to pay debts and ingagements which are not less than £1,400.” But by 1626 the Plymouth colony was in deep financial trouble.\nIn July 1627 twelve of the original pilgrim fathers, who became known as the ‘Undertakers’ (NB meaning ‘those taking on an undertaking’ and not those burying people!), agreed to pay the sums owed in London and become personally liable in the event of default. The ‘Undertakers’ would get the profits of the beaver fur trade for six years for the whole colony, and profits from corn and tobacco, to be reassessed after 1633. Richard Andrews was among a handful of remaining merchant adventurers who provided a high-interest loan to the ‘Undertakers’ and others were named as agents to receive and trade in all goods and merchandise sent to England and to purchase supplies for Plymouth Colony.\nIn 1628 the Pilgrims’ debt was revised to £1,800, to be repaid in instalments every September up to 1636 to just five remaining investors. Including Richard Andrews, Haberdasher, Timothy Hatherly, Felt Maker, and John Beauchamp, Salter, later known as the English Partners. Through this agreement, the investors in England gave up all claims to ”the said stocks, shares, lands, marchandise and chatles” in the Plymouth plantation.\nFinally, by 1641 all parties in the Plymouth affair wanted their freedom from their debts and loans. So the remaining joint-stock, consisting of housing, boats, implements and commodities, valued at £1,400 was shared out by the London Partners. The Plymouth pilgrim leaders also promised the London Partners £1,200 at £400 down and £200 per year to settle their debt. Thus it was that they paid a sum of £500 to Richard Andrews, who had by this time become a proprietor of the Massachusetts Bay Company and a permanent resident in Boston, Massachusetts. He used his share to buy cattle and make other provision for the relief of the poor in the Massachusetts Bay colony.\nThe rest as they say is history...",

However, while it's no secret that the justice system is currently under enormous strain, this basic principle on which so much is built is being severely compromised.\nInnocent until proven guilty, or the presumption of innocence, has been a hallmark of the UK's legal system for a long time. However, while it's no secret that the justice system is currently under enormous strain, this basic principle on which so much is built is being severely compromised.\nIt stands to reason that if we are going to debate whether we are delivering on the principle of 'justice for the accused', we need to define what that looks like. Naturally, it has to be considered in parallel with justice, care, and protection for the victims of crime and their loved ones, as well as the protection of society and the general public from the possibility of further harm. However, we also cannot lose sight of three things:\n- The principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' is essential. Article 6 of the Human Rights Act of 1998, details that everyone in the UK has a right to a fair trial.\n- We must consider what justice for the accused looks like in practical terms, such as the impact of processes including time awaiting trial on that individual's life, from loss of earnings to mental health. Regardless of guilt, it does not serve society to lose our compassion or our ethics in the pursuit of justice.\n- We must address the conditions in which, and by which, people are held on remand, both for the benefit of society and mindful of the long-term impact that process has on an individual and their life beyond the criminal justice system.\nHonouring the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty'\nThe Article 6 legislation reads: \"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\"\nHonouring this principle is essential, not just in the interests of fairness, but also for the protection of our own humanity. Whatever the evidence, until someone has been found guilty of an offence, they should not be treated as though they have already been convicted. Indeed, it also has to be acknowledged that there is a chance that the individual is not guilty. The justice system is not infallible. Notably, the Criminal Cases Review Commission recorded an 18.9% rise in miscarriage of justice claims in 2023, particularly from commonly under-represented groups, including women.\nThis needs to be balanced with protection for victims and society, making expediency and accuracy within the justice system something we need to treat as a matter of urgency.\nWhat does justice for the accused look like?\nThe question of what justice for the accused looks like is complicated, spanning everything from the conditions people are held in to the length of time spent awaiting trial. There's a global conversation about detention without trial, as well as time to trial and time to sentencing. There's also the issue of those still serving an indeterminate prison penalty (IPP), or a sentence without a set release date, a concept removed from the Statute Book in 2023 but still leaving 1,355 people without a release date as of 30th June 2024, even though 98% had served their tariff.\nFormer MP, ex-prisoner, and now priest and part-time prison chaplain at HMP Pentonville, Reverend Jonathan Aitken is a passionate campaigner for prison reform. He has been raising awareness around the issue of how long we keep people awaiting trial in the UK for years. When I spoke to him recently, he highlighted that since he became a prison chaplain in 2018, the number of prisoners on remand at Pentonville alone has gone up staggeringly, estimated in 2023 to be more than 75% of the total number of inmates in an institution that was reaching almost its entire operational capacity of 1,205.\nOn a national scale, the government's data records that as of 30th June 2024 there were 17,070 prisoners being held on remand in the UK, from a total prison population of 87,726. Meanwhile, when looking at how long people spent on remand on average, the report, reads:\n\"The National Audit Office estimated that as of 30 June 2021 individual defendants in the Crown Court spent an average of 209 days held on remand—an increase of 86 days compared with 31 March 2020.\"\nIt continues: \"Furthermore, a recent answer from the Ministry of Justice to a Written Parliamentary Question stated that the number of people who had been held on remand for six months or more increased from 4,218 to 4,582 between December 2021 and September 2022. 770 of those had been held for two years or more; up from 480 in December 2021.\"\nNotably, this is an issue that was not covered in the Independent Sentencing Review 2024 to 2025: Call for Evidence in November 2024 - neither was the issue of (IPP). Perhaps inadvertently adding some context to the issue of remand however, the Rt Hon David Gauke wrote in the foreword:\n\"The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the last 30 years. We now have the highest incarceration rate of any Western European country and the prison population is projected to continue to rise by four and a half thousand offenders a year. Supply of new prison places has not kept up with the increase in demand and for the eighteen months after February 2023, the male estate was routinely operating at above 99% capacity.\"\nWhile Article 6 does not define what a fair amount of time awaiting trial may be, these figures seem to be a far cry from the decree that \"everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time\", by anyone's measure.\nConditions and care of those held on remand\nOn the topic of conditions and care of those held on remand, it is not only a matter of compassion, ethics and humanity, but also consideration for the impact this time has on this person, their loved ones, and how they re-enter society as and when. It does not serve any of us well to damage someone's mental health, or destroy their practical lives beyond repair for when they return to civilian life, whether that's following a custodial sentence or having been found innocent. If anything, that is likely to lead to a downward spiral.\nWritten evidence from an Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody: The role of adult custodial remand in the criminal justice system from 2022, published by Parliament, writes: \"People in prison held on remand are a particularly vulnerable group. The remand population is increasing, as is the length of time that people are held on remand. Even short periods in custody can drastically impact family relationships, employment and housing.\"\nIt continues to highlight that: \"People on remand have the highest rate of self-inflicted deaths in prisons.\"\nIt is no secret that the conditions our prisons are in, is untenable. In July, Rishi Sunak was warned by senior civil servants that the overcrowding crisis 'risked breaching legal responsibilities', resulting in Labour's decision to release around 1,750 former offenders early, in September.\nMeanwhile, I was able to visit HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs in West London myself in November. The famous penitentiary has hit the headlines on numerous occasions recently, and for all the wrong reasons. The proliferation of drugs and violence, staff shortages, can be found in a litany of newspaper articles across the Internet. Indeed, last year, The Independent detailed that \"Between 2021 and 2022, six deaths were reported in custody, with three of those described as self-inflicted.\" They also went into detail about the state of the prison, the quality of the food, levels of violence and more. They are not alone in reporting these issues.\nWorking together for better outcomes\nI do not flatter myself that I have all the answers. However, as I reflect on my duty, and indeed dedication, to a role as one of the Lord Mayor’s representatives at the Old Bailey, I do think that there is some small opportunity to bring together minds that are more informed than my own to help set things on an improved trajectory.\nFor example, I have recently had the pleasure of meeting the team at StandOut, an award-winning charity that empowers people to make positive change, realise their potential, and rebuild their lives after prison. I think that they, alongside many other passionate people, have the understanding, vision, humanity, and mindset, that combined the rigours of government and machinations of the legal system, can help drive the conversation towards improving the experience of those accused of a crime and awaiting trial.\nIf we can do that, then I believe wholeheartedly, that we can also improve experiences and outcomes for victims and society as well.",

I continue to see it as a pleasure and a privilege to use my experience and perspective to serve the City in this ancient office whilst continuing to serve our Ward and this great City, by leading the Ward's civic team, with a particular focus on the following:\n- Supporting the Lord Mayor in promoting the City and UK financial and professional services.\n- Representing the Lord Mayor at official events to promote the City and everything that it does.\n- Participating in the City of London Corporation business by serving on Committees, representing the values and offerings that the City has to offer.\n- Seeking opportunities to widen the reach of the Court of Aldermen and marketing the work of the City of London Corporation at home and abroad.\n- Working collegiately with colleagues on the Court of Aldermen for the benefit of the City and those it impacts.\n- Hosting His Majesty’s Judges and guests at the Old Bailey on behalf of the Lord Mayor.\nI started working in the City more than 30 years ago and, I believe wholeheartedly that its role is one of service - as individuals to the City, as companies to our clients and as the City to the nation as a whole.\nEvery day I seek to remember that for each transaction or communication I am part of in my professional life, there is an individual for whom it is deeply important. Perhaps it is helping them to save for a well-earned holiday, for their retirement, a new car or to buy their first home. It may simply be to create a little more security for their loved ones in an uncertain world. This is a view I carry through to my role as Alderman and seek to expand upon in that capacity.\nPlease click here to see my official profile including my committee appointments at The City of London Corporation.\nContact Me\nThank you for your interest.\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss any Ward matters in person,\nplease call 07784 298187 or email me at robert.hughes-penney@cityoflondon.gov.uk\nLeading the world\nThe Corporation of London plays a vital role in supporting and promoting London as the world’s leading financial and business centre, partnering with local communities to increase opportunities for all Londoners, and enhancing the capital as a culture hub. It is headed by the Lord Mayor, who with the other elected members, comprising Aldermen and Common Councillors make up the Court of Common Council that is the Corporation’s primary decision-making assembly. My belief is that the City and all its constituent parts play an essential role in setting the standard, leading the way and influencing ethical and effective global business practices to the benefit of all. Click here to see how the Corporation makes decisions.\nMeeting Challenges\nThe City of London plays a pivotal role in supporting society and the global effort to address challenges, from the cost-of-living to climate change. Alongside these, the City must continue to learn to adapt to a future outside of the European Union, cope with a growing regulatory burden and address the increasingly unsustainable levels of public, private and personal debts that are widening divisions within society. As your elected representative, I am prioritising these issues and mobilising the City to find creative solutions, championing the need for a plan for economic growth for the nation, as well as growth in productivity in the City. For example, I have been heartened by initiatives such as the launch of the Mansion House Compact, which aims to have 5% of pension assets invested in future growth companies to deliver stronger growth for pension funds and thus more comfortable retirements for pensioners.\nA Thriving City\nFor the City to thrive in the future, we must make some important adjustments. As we embrace the merits of remote and flexible working, we must also ensure that our urban centre does not become less relevant and is instead utilised more intelligently to add value to professional life. Crucially, there is an imperative to restore the City’s reputation as a bastion of society’s interests by improving standards of conduct in financial services and expanding its charitable contributions. Since the pandemic, we have seen several measures come into play that work towards these goals, but there is more to be done. By serving on the Finance Committee overseeing the management of the City’s multi-million finances, sitting on the Board of the Impact Investing Institute and welcoming a host of other conferences and events that bring together those with the capacity to drive change, I am confident in our collective ability to make a positive difference.\nMy Commitment\nI have long believed in the importance of the financial and political sectors to enhance life experiences for individuals and society. Having started work in the City more than 30 years ago, and served in elected office for nearly 14 years, I am more certain and committed to that endeavour than ever.\nTo date, I have received so much from the City of London: education at a Livery school; a grant from the Lord Mayor’s 800th-anniversary trust for a life-changing mission trip to South America; a stimulating career, and the opportunity to provide for my family. With that in mind, I have sought to give back, to help it to grow and prosper.\nThere are significant challenges stemming from global turbulence, the cost-of-living crisis and other more. However, I believe that economic stability is a fundamental humanitarian provision and herein the City, which has a profound impact on the economy in London, the UK and the world around us, has a powerful role to play.\nI am a firm believer that, with wisdom borne of centuries of experience, the City is primed to remain the world’s leading financial, legal, and professional services centre, even reaching new heights if we are prudent and conscious with our approach.\nI hope this is something I contribute to in my position as Alderman of the Ward of Cheap. It’s a role that gives me a deeply felt opportunity to bring together my personal and professional experience in a way that contributes to the wellbeing of those within the City of London and all those connected to it, in the constant pursuit of a better future.",

  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_the-city-and-serving-the-nations/content_9.html": "31 October 2022\nThe City and ‘serving the nations’\nThe City of London has an important and powerful role to play in supporting the UK and our international allies at this moment in time. Its economic importance cannot be underestimated, and while its position when things are good is important, its skills, expertise, power and values are even more poignant when times are hard. For me, the role of The City is about service - as individuals to The City, as companies to our clients, and as The City to the nation and the world. Now, more than ever, we have an opportunity to serve.\nThis autumn has marked a period of change - a new Prime Minister, a new cabinet, a renewed energy to address the challenges of the day - and they do need addressing. The cost of living crisis raises immediate and systemic questions in economics and beyond.\nIn his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the economist, Thomas Piketty, discussed his belief that the economic system we have, inevitably leads to financial inequality. The pillars on which we have lived for so long are perhaps showing their age, and we need to take a moment to think about our motivations accordingly.\nIn another sphere, The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby said: \"We are living in times – and in a world – that urgently need healing, justice and hope.” To my mind, he is right. Whether you want to look at domestic fluctuations in politics and central government, the global challenges of war, international discord and the cost of living, or the personal challenges we all face, internally and with our loved ones, there is a lot going on, much of which requires more support than perhaps at other times.\nIn answer to the current climate, in recent months the Rt. Revd Dr. Graham Tomlin is stepping down from his position as Bishop of Kensington to lead the Centre for Cultural Witness from its base at Lambeth Palace.\nDuring his time as Bishop of Kensington, Reverend Tomlin has supported communities in West London, in particular following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The purpose of the new initiative is theological research, to communicate Christian perspectives on culture and contemporary life, and to debate how the Church might contribute, challenge and respond to contemporary cultural issues alongside those of all faiths and none.\nIn short, he is focusing on bringing communities together, but what is happening in the world today that makes him feel that now is the time for a different approach?\nRe-aligning with our values\nValues - our values and the ones we want to stand for - are the running thread here. Knowing what values we in The City stand for and want to represent, communicating them and most importantly, acting on them, is the map that can guide us.\nMark Carney's book, Value(s), opens by citing Pope Francis at a Bank of England lunch, noting how current trends are turning the wine of humanity into a toxic grappa of self-interest. The Guardian summed up Carney's seven key values as \"solidarity, fairness, responsibility, resilience, sustainability, dynamism and humility – all laced with compassion.\"\nLord Green addressed the search for human values in his 2019 book, The Human Odyssey. Meanwhile, his 2009 book Good Value: Reflections on Money, Morality and an Uncertain World, marks him out as 'a banker with good intentions' - as one Amazon reviewer put it.\nThis question of value and values is a poignant one for all, but especially in The City of London, so often seen on a human level as purely being a money-making machine, siloed from the rest of the UK. To my mind, its value and values run far deeper than that, but it’s important that we remain cognisant of them, reflect on them, ensure their relevance and effectiveness. Collectively we need to know the values that we want to underpin the City today and going forward.\nService to ‘the nations’\nFor me, the root of knowing this and achieving this is about service - as individuals to The City, as companies to our clients, and as The City to the nation and the world.\nThe City has an important and powerful role to play in supporting the UK and our international allies at this moment in time. Its economic importance cannot be underestimated, and while its position when things are good is important, its skills, expertise, power and values are even more poignant when times are hard - notably in building back the economy.\nAs we consider our values and how we want to serve individuals, customers, the UK and the global community, I don't think we need to consider radical change to our structure. In many ways I think it's about remembering who we are and what we stand for.\nLord Jonathan Hill wrote in a government report last year about how we might encourage more tech companies in the UK. His thoughts were followed by The Kalifa Review. The encouragement of technology companies in the UK is brilliant, and I have written about it before. However, it is not to replace or detract from the UK’s commercial heritage. Historically and culturally we are an outward facing global trading nation; 80% of total UK GDP (and 82% of employment), is the product of invisible services rather than goods.\nWe need to understand who we are, what our USP is, what our historic culture is and align ourselves with our heritage and DNA as being an outward facing nation, rather than aiming to be a replica of the United States or anywhere else. We have our own cultural identity and when others are withdrawing in a world of de-globalisation, we can fall back on our historic cultural DNA, our international connections and the Commonwealth to meet the needs of everyone involved. These are bonds that are not so readily available to others.\nThe City is here to serve, and to serve all - that is our core value.",

  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_trade-is-the-first-line-of-defence/content_7.html": "10 January 2023\nTrade is the first line of defence\nWith my own military background, now viewed through the lens of a career in the City, I believe trade delegates and our armed forces have an important role to play in working towards a positive future for the UK as well as our international allies.\nWhen we think about defence of our nation and international peace, trade isn't always at the forefront of our thoughts. Equally, when we consider the economy, growing food, energy insecurity and political turbulence, we don't necessarily think of our armed forces and the role they may be able to play in correcting the course.\nHowever, trade, diplomacy, economics and security are all inextricably linked, and when they work together they can achieve great things. Our forces are, quite literally, a weapon in our collective arsenal, but their function is more sophisticated, more nuanced and more powerful than we might instinctively recognise.\nWith my own military background, now viewed through the lens of a career in the City, I believe trade delegates and our armed forces have an important role to play in working towards a positive future for the UK as well as our international allies.\nThe power of being seen\nThe visibility of the Union Jack is central to our trade diplomacy. Our nation's presence is at its most potent in the magnificence of our forces. It was brought to the forefront of our minds once again with pageantry and precision as the British Armed Forces performed their last duty to Her Late Majesty The Queen last year, and it was further highlighted by the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin Lord Mayor of London, in his Defence & Security Lecture in October. He said:\n\"...we should recognise the authority and agency that the military instrument offers, and we should willingly embrace the ability of the Armed Forces to support our national interest in all its forms.\"\nHis speech reiterated and elaborated on the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith's Annual Defence and Security Lecture in 2021, in which he said that strong trade links are the first line of defence. Last year, Sir Tony Radakin built on that concept, drawing a line between defence and trade and investment.\nThe silent strength of the armed forces\nIt is not just the big events in which the UK’s visibility is pronounced and powerful. The quiet presence of our nation around the world is equally important. Going forward, the hope is that the Lord Mayor’s business delegations overseas might coincide with the visits of Royal naval ships to local ports - each reiterating the other.\nTo some extent, this is already the case. We currently have ships in the Pacific, we had an aircraft carrier in the region early last year, and we have submarines in the Indo-Pacific region as part of the AUKUS deal - the trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nIn short, the visibility of our nation is an important reminder to all of Britain’s place in the world. From powerful leaders to investors and trade delegates, they are reminded that they can look to us for investment and commercial progress.\nSir Radakin continued: \"It is about a maximalist approach to the military instrument. Using our power and influence in all its guises: both to further our security and prosperity. But especially – when we get it right – to add to the agency and authority of the British Government and the nation.\"\nSecurity and stability matter in the City of London\nThere is, of course, a practical link between the armed forces and trade. The mere ability to do trade is something we all need to safeguard for our collective survival and the forces are integral to that.\nConsider the impact of the events in the Ukraine, which have been appalling to watch on a human level, and have also caused massive economic disruption - blocking trade routes and threatening oil and gas supplies. Putin acts believing his actions have no consequences beyond the ones he himself wishes to unleash. His actions do matter though - as Admiral Sir Tony Radakin continued:\n\"... they matter here in the City of London too, because markets thrive on stability, and our prosperity rests on a world that is safe for the passage of trade. And when the rules are broken, volatility and instability follow. When aggression is left unchecked the costs ricochet through global markets. This affects people everywhere, and especially the world’s poorest.\"\nThe British Army is one of the most highly regarded and best equipped armies in the world, with heritage in delivering success in combat. Our Royal Navy is one of the most respected armed forces in the world. The RAF is one of the most technologically sophisticated and capable air forces, and Britain's Royal Marines are known for their worldwide rapid response and ability to deal with a spectrum of threats and security challenges.\nOur Prime Minister has previously said that he believes in \"investing in our armed forces\". As we look to repair the economy, improve global security and move forward positively, the links between trade and military strength should not be ignored. To finish on one final extract from Sir Radakin's speech:\n\"It is also a tool to help drive a broader national agenda. And when we get it really right, then we enhance the authority of the British government, and with it our nation’s strength and security in this competitive world.\"",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_a-time-for-patience-and-practical-considerations/content_50.html": "22 July 2020\nA time for patience and practical considerations\nIt has now been four months since many of us left our offices in the City of London to work from home, and while 'normality' is still some way off, it is a good time to reflect on what has been achieved as well as what we can, need and want to do moving forward.\nDespite the recent changes, it seems unlikely that we will return to something that most of us consider resembles normality before the end of the summer. Inevitably, some things will have changed irreversibly - a few for the better and some presenting huge personal and professional challenges. Even so, there is much being done to support businesses and individuals in the City of London today, as well as much that needs to be done collectively, as leaders and as individuals in order to move forward in a balanced and productive way.\nRemote working has been truly embraced\nDespite monumental disruption, the City of London has shown extraordinary resilience so far this year. Many firms that are now operating on a work from home basis are thriving. Meanwhile, the City is working to try to support businesses, especially those that are not able to take advantage of work from home alternatives, and we will endeavour to do more wherever possible.\nThe capability of working from home has been a lifeline for many businesses in The City, and in many cases it has perhaps provided a long overdue reassessment of what true remote working and flexible working programmes can offer both businesses and individuals by way of opportunity, productivity, diversity and even cost-effectiveness. However, it has also highlighted a number of areas that we would all be wise to think about when planning the route ahead.\nIt is clear that remote working and truly flexible office hours can have enormous efficiency benefits. For many, working from home, especially in the blissful summer months, can also offer the chance for a much-improved work/life balance. Some are able to take great pleasure in swapping the morning commute for a leisurely stroll in the sunshine before sitting down to a morning of emails with a coffee in hand.\nMeanwhile, the almost universal use of online communications can mean thinking nothing of communicating with Los Angeles at one time of the day and Beijing at another without batting an eyelid. Even though that was possible before, the difference now is that everyone we’re communicating with is via the same medium, so there’s little need for differentiation in the way we think about it - so long as we get the time difference right.\nOne can also see how working from home could open up opportunities for those who previously felt restricted from entering or maintaining a career in The City by the battle between working hours and childcare solutions, expensive commutes and prohibitive London and Greater London property prices. Perhaps a change could facilitate a growing and more diverse workforce?\nAppreciating the strengths and limitations of remote working\nThat said, we should not think about working from home as a complete alternative to going to an office to meet people in person. Instead, it should be part of a more dynamic and flexible way of working for us all, as and where it adds value.\nPerhaps the most immediate and problematic impact of a City that’s no longer in The City, is the one it has on SMEs including cafes, bars, shops, restaurants and cultural destinations. Of course, they have been acutely affected by Covid-19 in having to close completely. However, as more of us enjoy the benefits of working from home, the long-term impact on those businesses has also been threatened. The sharply reduced footfall of people buying their sandwiches, having their meetings or grabbing their morning coffee en-route to the office threatens those businesses in a way we could not have imagined before the health crisis.\nWe have taken measures to mitigate against this, with initiatives such as the business rate relief where retail, hospitality and leisure businesses do not need to pay business rates for the 2020 to 2021 tax year. We applied this automatically to businesses in the City of London, so they do not need to apply.\nWe have also been able to offer rent relief for City of London businesses where The City of London Corporation agreed to defer one quarter’s rent for a range of tenants struggling as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. A grant scheme was also announced by central government to assist small businesses with a rateable value of up to £51,000, and we sent out forms to all eligible businesses to make that process easier. Following that, I and my three Ward Common Councillors, Alastair Moss, Nick Bensted-Smith and Tijs Broeke, have been able to respond to a number of queries from businesses in the Ward, seeking to help access support.\nThe impact of socialising\nOn a less tangible note, while remote working has enormous upsides that should not be ignored, we should not forget the benefits that physically going into The City and being a present part of that community can offer - on a human level as well as on a business level.\nAs humans, we are very much social creatures, thriving on interactions and in-person communication with others. While it may seem trivial, those serendipitous meetings as you walk from the Tube station to the office, bumping into colleagues and business partners as you go, can be fundamental to building valuable relationships that are ultimately good for us personally as well as professionally.\nThe sociable nature of the way we learn must also not be underestimated. The success of the City hinges in no small part on the learning and training that happens there. The impact the current circumstances have had on younger people who are looking to develop their careers, have been particularly tough. For all the, extremely important, qualifications in the world, there is no substitute for physically learning alongside those who have trodden the path before you. Attending meetings, building relationships and the intentionality of seeing an expert in their field put into practice the things you learn in the classroom as well as the things you can only learn through experience, is a vital part of developing the talent of the future, so that they can take what we know today and build upon it.\nHow The City is supporting businesses now and moving forward\nAt the moment there is still fear about going back to work in the office, which is entirely understandable, and we are putting measures in place to reassure everyone and make us all feel safe. For example, the City Corporation’s Planning and Transportation Committee, chaired by Deputy Alastair Moss, has been considering moves to reallocate some street space to al fresco dining. We are ensuring people can move around City streets safely and efficiently, especially by walking and cycling with more space for walking and cycling, including increased cycle parking, timed closures for motor vehicles, signage to remind us all of the importance of social distancing and safe behaviour as we go about our day amongst further measures to make workplaces Covid secure. The Chair of the Policy & Resources Committee, and Alastair, have also written to the the Rt Hon. Grant Shapps, Secretary of State for Transport, seeking support for increased confidence amongst passengers/commuters to get the City moving again.\nBy doing these things and more, we are able to feel confident as we gradually reopen our cultural venues and libraries – something The City and The Lord Mayor are working hard to achieve. A new mindfulness in the way we operate is a chance for more of us to explore The City’s streets and support our local businesses safely and responsibly. Perhaps in walking a little further and taking a few less Tube stops we will discover something new about our City. There is also much more to look forward to – for example, planning approval has been given to the new Museum of London Smithfield development.\nThe City is not just a place of business, it is an important and unique community. Something I notice in particular in the Ward of Cheap, to which I was elected Alderman nearly two years ago to the day. For that sense of community to thrive as well as it should, we are taking action to support the reopening of schools and a return to work for the benefit of the economy, but also for our sense of social, cultural and mental wellbeing.\nThe work we do is not limited to The City either; it’s part of the community of London as a whole. We know from experience that it is essential that different London agencies work together for the success of us all, evidenced most recently during the full lockdown as a part of the Strategic Coordination Group. With that in mind, we also need to be open to new ideas - investing in and levelling up across London, as is the case with our new Smithfield market relocation project.\nDespite the changes and the challenges of 2020 to date, it’s important to remind ourselves that the City of London has been continuing to thrive throughout this period. It might not have been to the extent that it was before, and it might not have been in the way we would have imagined. However, it is testament to its strength as a whole and to the ingenuity of individuals that it has continued to show its resilience.\nWe might be considering the shape of how we return to ‘business as usual’ and there is understandably trepidation around that. However, we are very much open for business. By being proactive, patient, looking forward and finding opportunity in adversity, we can extend a helping hand to those amongst us who have been hit the hardest, and we can expect with healthy enthusiasm to have much to look forward to in the not too distant future.\nImage credit: Statue of reformer Sir Rowland Hill Grade II listed statue by Edward Onslow Ford, on King Edward Street",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_results-and-relationship-reimagining-success/content_42.html": "04 October 2020\nResults and Relationship: Reimagining Success\nFor many of us, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought challenges into view that we never saw coming.\nIntroduction\nIt’s highly likely that among people reading this article, the experience of suffering is widespread. Many will have had the illness themselves, tragically lost someone, or felt some of the ubiquitous indirect impacts of economic lockdown.\nYet for as many who have suffered, there are just as many, who through it all, feel that somehow, this experience has created space to reevaluate life, to think about how and why we’re living and what’s most important from this point on. Whatever your experience, one thing we all seem to share is a conviction that things can never be the same again.\nWe are at a watershed moment. We have an opportunity to question the things our culture has enshrined as definitions of success before now and ask whether in the light of COVID those ideas continue to be things we should believe. Does the way we look at the world need to change to make sense of the new things we’ve seen?\nResults or relationship?\nSomething that’s come into view could be described as the importance of “relationship”. People saying they’ve been blown away, deeply encouraged, inspired by the solidarity that has emerged among us. We’ve all pulled together, led by the NHS and other keyworkers to try and tackle the virus arm in arm. At the same time many charities have created initiatives “for a time such as this” and the corporate world has pivoted flexibly into agile working.\nThis new sense of the importance of relationship has been felt societally, and also more privately – people feeling fresh appreciation for their husbands, wives, children, wider family – seeing them in a new and beautiful light – valuing lockdown opportunities to put the kids to bed each night, having time to slow down, relieved of commuting stresses, actually eat lunch.\nPerhaps we’ve had a glimpse of the thing which is most important in this world – relationship. But it feels funny, it stands in contrast to the way most of us were living pre-COVID – the way we used to see things – the glasses we were wearing before the pandemic. Perhaps the old definition of success could be called the “results” based view.\nAt an individual level, the results-based view is the achievement of a set of goals or objectives in life and in our careers, driven to realise our potential – measuring success predominantly in material terms, to some extent seeing everything (everyone) else in the world as means to those ends. The market pays a proxy to the value of our life, we put in the work, we enjoy the results.\nAt a societal level, the results-based view looks at every problem, even moral problems, as issues to be addressed through market principles and ever-expanding definitions of economics. Healthcare, education, climate change, getting people to quit smoking or live beside runways – everything, even moral concerns, can be reduced to material terms.\nDavid Brooks of the New York Times likens the difference between the results and relationships views to the difference between two mountains. Brooks says the first mountain in life is an individualist worldview, about our own desires and fulfilment whereas the second mountain, where real meaning is found, is about relationship, commitment and contribution.\nThe ultimate difference between the two mountains according to Brooks – and the way to know which we’re standing on – is about whether our ultimate concern is for ourselves, or something outside of ourselves, on a broader horizon. A good question to ask is what we take to be the motivator and ultimate goal of all our activity? Results or relationship?\nWhich makes better sense?\nIt is worth reflecting further on our experiences during COVID to ask which of the results or relationship view of success makes better sense. Two things we really value have come into conflict but the stunning economic sacrifices we’ve made to protect human life and to shield the vulnerable show that relationship is closer to the deep fabric of what life is really all about.\nMore people are alive than might have been, but more businesses are closed than might have been. What amount of life is worth what amount of economic pain? The difficulty in equivocating between the two shows that the results-based view of the world, the lens of looking at success only in economic or material terms falls short of life’s biggest questions.\nCertain things don’t make sense in a results-based view, like this discerning the value of human life. The markets are not set up to place a value on human life – it pays nothing like what we’re really worth and they have no real proxy to the value and success of everything a person is. We’ve seen there is a fundamentally irreducible quality to how we should regard each other.\nAs a society we have said that when human life is in danger, we’ll do “whatever it takes” – “we will stop at nothing to protect people, the NHS and jobs” – in other words, these things are priceless – and even though the complexity runs deep, we agree on a fundamental level that there are things a results-based view of success has no power to rationalise.\nMorality calls for more\nCOVID has also brought urgent issues of injustice and inequality to the fore. Moral issues that can no longer be ignored – we ask can they be addressed to some sort of market-based approach or set of economic interventions to get things right in the future? Well, in market-language, the word for “morality” is roughly translated as “ethics”.\nEthics has been a vogue subject for quite some time, and certainly forms an important aspect of our training and development as financial professionals. But what is often missing from these training courses is the importance of forming character. It is blithe talk to talk about behaviour in the absence of forming character. It is to talk of outcome without substance.\nIn business, we’ve tended to think that if we can get enough people to do enough good things enough of the time, measured by some KPI, then somehow by a process of osmosis our economy and thus by extension our society will fix itself. Injustice and inequality solved by the market, with no need for anyone really reflect on their own character.\nBut we know that ethics viewed in that manner is not morality. The ethics of a results approach is really just a faint shadow of the morality of relationship. The allocation of everything in life can’t be understood by reference to the ability to pay – inequality will always be the result of that assumption. Getting people to do the right thing can’t be understood as box-ticking.\nPerhaps the underlying reason why a results-based approach cannot and will never bring us the success we’re really looking for in life, is that every time we look at things that way, our view of reality is obscured – or maybe a better word is “reduced” – because the only things that can be seen are objects – when we look at people, even they are turned from subjects into objects.\nJohn Green in his prize-winning book, Looking for Alaska, put his finger on the heart of the issue. “People were created to be loved. Things were created to be used. The reason the world is in chaos, is because things are being loved and people are being used.” Really often, the objectifying, reductionist effect of the results-based view leads to the sacrifice of relationship.\nIs there any significance to the fact that most trading decisions on banking floors are made by algorithms, not people? Is it weird that in Silicon Valley entrepreneurs see it as a virtue to go bankrupt numerous times in pursuit of some start-up? Should we welcome that our debt and bond markets are becoming just as faceless as the equities?\nMore personally: are you a little like me? Are you the late person home only to check emails on repeat? Is your mind always somewhere else? The end point of a results-based definition of success is a place where not only is it difficult for us to understand what loving people and not using them in business might entail, but that we struggle even to translate the language.\nWhere to go from here?\nIf it is true that a relationships view of the world makes better sense, then at some level, what is required is a giving of ourselves, a giving of our heart – since that is where relationship begins. As a Christian, it is interesting to consider the example of Jesus Christ who gave himself so that we might be reconciled with each other restored to relationship with God.\nJesus Christ spoke a lot about the tension we feel between results and relationships. One of the most famous Parables he told was the Parable of the Prodigal Son. It’s a profound story about two sons who asked their father to give them their inheritance while he was still alive – in other words they wished him dead – the ultimate sacrifice of relationship for material gain.\nOne of these boys went off and spent his money on wild material pursuits, taking an individualist ideology to the extreme. The other son stayed at home, and according to the KPIs of the day, looked like a far more ethical person. However, the point of the story is not a criticism of desires for material gain – it’s that neither of them valued relationship.\nRelationship featured nowhere in their definition of success. An interesting point about this Parable is that in the West we call it the Prodigal Son but in the Middle East, not forgetting that Jesus would have originally told it for that audience, it’s referred to as the Parable of the Running Father because of the lengths the Father goes to to restore relationship.\nWhen the younger son realises he’s messed up, he comes home and his Father runs to greet him, to some extent disgracing himself in the process. And in that moment, the relationship is restored – he gets a ring on his finger, a robe on his back, and a party to celebrate – it turns out that the result he was always looking for was to be found in relationship all along!\nConclusion\nThis is the claim at the heart of Christianity: that God made us for relationship with himself and that in that relationship, we find the means of our greatest flourishing. Sometimes things come along in life which cause us to reevaluate the way we’re looking at the world, to focus on something we’ve never seen before – for many people, COVID has done exactly that.\nOur world and our society are going through a profound watershed moment – it may be a time for you too to think about whether there is a different definition of success waiting for you in this life, prioritising and repairing relationships that have gone wrong, with the people on a horizontal level with you in this world – husbands, wives, children, friends, loved ones.\nThe beautiful thing about the Parable of the Prodigal Son is that when we come to consider whether or not to repair our relationship, vertically, with God – we will find that he loves us and welcomes us home with open arms. Many have said that life is a bit like a Rubik’s cube that’s disorganised from every angle until the “click” of relationship with God is put in place.\nThis is something I have found to be very true of my own life – perhaps you may find the same. At the close of this short reflection, might I take the opportunity to wish you and your family well. In these unprecedented and challenging days, it is my hope that you are enjoying relative health, safety and security.",

I was deeply humbled to receive an award from the SWFI Chair, Lakshmi Narayanan, recognising the importance of our collaborative efforts.\nChair of the Investment Managers Charitable Trust, Anthony, Chair of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, Lakshmi, Fellow Aldermen, Your Excellency, Distinguished guests, Ladies & Gentlemen\nGood evening, and can I say what a privilege and pleasure it is to be here with you this evening as the Representative Lord Mayor of the City of London, at this inaugural dinner for the Investment Managers Charitable Trust. Well done Anthony for arranging this splendid evening. And I would also like to honour Mark Henderson the founding Master of the Guild, without whose vision and determination for the Guild and the associated charity we would not be here.\nIt is wonderful to be back at Haberdashers’ Hall for this occasion, and there is a lovely sense of continuity for the Guild of Investment Managers, who held the inaugural civic dinner, with Sir Alan Yarrow as Representative Lord Mayor on that occasion, in this very Hall four years ago.\nIndeed, on that occasion both Sheriffs were also present, one of whom was one Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli, now of course the 695th Lord Mayor. And he is deeply sorry that he cannot be here tonight. But as you know the Lord Mayor spends about a third of his or her year travelling overseas as the Government’s ambassador for financial & professional services.\nHe writes a message of good wishes as follows:-\n“I am delighted that the Guild of Investment Managers are hosting this Inaugural Investment Managers’ Charitable Trust Dinner, bringing together guests from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute Conference and across the investment management sector.\nI am sorry that travel in Singapore and Japan keeps me from joining you this evening, but tonight’s event is a fantastic opportunity to make connections and, importantly, raise money to support individuals from less advantaged backgrounds hoping to study entry qualifications to the investment industry.\nI commend the Guild of Investment Managers on this work and thank all of you for getting behind such an excellent cause. I hope you have a wonderful evening.”\nAs is alluded to in those words the mayoral theme this year is Connect to Prosper, a theme designed to highlight the City of London as the world’s most successful concentration of knowledge connections both locally and globally. Over 40 learned societies, 70 higher education institutions, and 130 research institutes exist in and around the City of London. The Square Mile is made up of many “knowledge miles” with expertise in art, media, culture, engineering, research, accounting, law, banking, shipping, insurance, and investment management. And which the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute’s conference is tapping into these.\nWe have major talent clusters – Knowledge-based businesses; finance, professional services and technology, thrive when they cluster and have access to talented people, capital and markets.\nThe City of London’s Square Mile is often known as the world’s coffeehouse where people bring their dreams to get them realised. In this vein we note that London is home to more Sovereign Wealth Fund offices than any other global city. And so I am delighted, but not surprised that the Sovereign Wealth Fund institute has chosen London as the location for its second global wealth conference, after last year’s highly successful inaugural conference here in the City – can we all say to Lakshmi and the SWFI team, welcome back!\nBut tonight, we gather not merely as investors, managers or stewards of financial capital, but as stewards and potential catalysers also of human capital, and importantly the human capital of the future that beckons with promise and potential. And I applaud and commend to you the Investment Managers Charitable Trust, with its focus on financial education and exams. It is initiatives such as these that will importantly ensure that the City’s gates are as wide open as possible to young men and women who have the talent, commitment and aptitude to succeed.\nAs we sit in this wonderful Haberdashers’ Hall we can reflect on how these aims align with the education work that has been a major part of the City of London Corporation’s work, and the Livery Companies since Tudor times. Indeed, the Haberdashers’ Company alone today has about 20 schools and some 12,000 students, and I must confess to having been to the Haberdashers’ Boys’ School in the sixth form – or years 12 and 13 in modern currency.\nWe will all have our own stories of how we got to where we are, but I would note that I was very grateful and fortunate enough to receive a sixth form scholarship while there, and later as an undergraduate an award from the Lord Mayor’s 800th anniversary trust.\nIn our own ways I am sure each of us can think of a person or an organisation that has allowed us to take the path we have followed. So today as we sit here can I encourage you to consider the potential beneficiaries, and the difference that your support might make.\nTonight, we sit at a crossroads of finance and philanthropy, and I commend the charity for the work it is doing practically and as a beacon of hope for those who seek to access and navigate the labyrinthine streets of our great City. In the great tradition of the City Bridge Foundation, the trust offers a bridge that spans the chasm between privilege and promise, from the schoolroom to the trading floor.\nSo, “I ask you all to rise and drink a toast to the Investment Managers Charitable Trust, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute and the Guild of Investment Managers, coupled with the names of the Chairs, Mr Anthony Yadgaroff, Mr Lakshmi Narayanan and the Master of the Guild of Investment Managers, Deputy Henry Pollard.”",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_south-africa-s-national-day-and-future-trade-opportunities/content_30.html": "27 April 2021\nSouth Africa's National Day and Future Trade Opportunities\nToday, Tuesday 27th April, marks South Africa’s National Day, otherwise known as the National Freedom Day\nAs the place of my childhood, South Africa holds a great degree of personal value. Even throughout my career, I have enjoyed continued interactions with this great nation – from chairing the organising committee for the State Banquet for the President in the City of London’s Guildhall, to accompanying the Lord Mayor on his business delegation there. However, I am reminded that strong ties have also long existed on a national level, with respects to history, migration, our legal systems and, not least, trade. In the 1960s, South Africa began developing the most sophisticated banking system on the continent to support its industrial advances and bolstered its financial services trade with Britain. Today, the UK exports up to £300m worth of financial services to South Africa, with £61m coming the other way[1]. The London Stock Exchange now hosts more African companies than any other international stock exchange. The 112 African companies listed – many of whom are South African – are worth more than £125 billion, while the 56 African bonds listed in London have raised £50 billion to date[2]. Furthermore, South Africa is the largest African recipient of British foreign direct investment, standing at 30 per cent, with a particular emphasis on financial services[3].\nWith the trade value of South Africa obvious to the UK Government, it was vital that diplomats ensured continuity and integrated future opportunities in post-Brexit agreements. This emphasis resulted in the formation of the SACUM-UK Economic Partnership Agreement between the UK and the six countries in the southern Africa region, which preserves the same trading conditions that existed when the UK was a member state of the European Union. Under these conditions, approximately 90% of trade with South Africa was tariff-free and quota-free[4]. The SACUM-UK agreement also contains a ‘built-in agenda’, which specifies a range of issues that the UK and SACUM will consider as part of future negotiations, and the potential for South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or the UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) to table propositions for improvement.\nThis arrangement, with the flexibility offered from the UK being outside of the EU, offers a stable launchpad from which to diversify investment and financial trade into the exciting areas of opportunity ahead of us. One area of UK investment into South Africa that we could see a significant increase in is fintech. As Gerry Grimstone, the Minister for Investment says: ‘diversifying and increasing trade and investment in sectors such as tech will be crucial for economic recovery from coronavirus, and Britain has a vital role to play globally’[5]. This is echoed in DIT’s new Tech for Growth Programme, which looks to establish greater UK-Africa fintech trade.\nUtilising British strength in fintech would also meet some of South Africa’s deepest needs. The first is a well-functioning banking sector. Eleven million people can currently be described as either unbanked or underbanked, but fintech can expand services like mobile banking or widen the remit of existing financial institutions. Another exciting opportunity is heightened infrastructure investment, necessary to address the shortage of high-quality, sustainable infrastructure in the region. At the UK-Africa Investment Summit 2020, the PM Johnson called for the mobilisation of sustainable finance for Africa, including a step-change in work on sustainable infrastructure, fuelled by a new partnership with the City of London. The first fruit of this was seen in November 2020, when the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) struck a deal with UK fintech firm Globacap, who agreed to launch a private placement platform for billions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects across Africa.\nWith political will strong, and fintech adoption forecasts indicating that South Africa is the third fastest-growing nation behind only China and India, there appears to be vast potential for cooperation in the future of this sector. As such, I am optimistic that UK-South Africa financial trade will only flourish in the years to come.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_ethics-and-economics-are-not-mutually-exclusive/content_27.html": "12 September 2023\nEthics and economics are not mutually exclusive\nRepaying loans whilst generating growth, helping individuals to have autonomy over their own financial success, creating transparency in the UK’s shareholding framework - could a different cultural attitude to debt create a healthier economy?\nEconomically the UK has a lot to consider at the moment. Obviously, there's the question of inflation, down to around 7% in July from 11% the previous year. Interest rates are up in terms of long-term cycles, and the general rate of economic growth is on a discount from other markets. The important question as far as I can see it, is how are we going to generate growth?\nCaught in our own modus operandi\nA longstanding belief in my mind is that there's too much debt in the world and that needs to be repaid. How you repay debt while trying to deliver growth at the same time, however, is tricky because it’s largely the expansion of debt over the last generation that has facilitated economic growth, albeit somewhat artificially.\nThere’s a tension between taking the moral high ground and seeking to pay debt while other states expand by using it. Part of the problem is also that debt is treated more tax efficiently than equity ownership within corporate structures under the capital gains tax (CGT) rules, which doesn’t help put things back on a better footing.\nHowever, to continue playing a proverbial game of pass the parcel is to risk holding it when it inevitably explodes. Therefore, whether it's individual, national and supranational, long-term debt has to be repaid if you're going to create real health and stability.\nPay now or pay later\nFavourable treatment of debt was likely introduced for good reasons - much like the mortgage interest relief at source (MIRAS) scheme, which began in 1983 in a bid to encourage home ownership and was abolished in April 2000 by Gordon Brown. Unlike MIRAS, the corporate debt benefits were not removed - perhaps it was considered too big a pill to swallow for industry and for the economy.\nIt's not that these things don't have a place, and people and businesses need to be able to borrow from time to time, but if we don't adopt a change in culture, knowledge, education and attitude, I wonder whether by pushing the issue further down the road we're merely making the issue bigger? After all the world nearly blew up in the credit crunch because there was too much debt and yet the response has been to continue expanding the debt bubble. There is an imperative around reducing excess debt that's only going to become more insistent with time.\nA purposeful culture shift\nDebt has become a fundamental part of our culture - on a personal level, corporate level and governmental level. Many of the frameworks that have been put in place have exacerbated that trend.\nFor example, the precursors to ISAs for example, were personal equity plans (PEPs), where you invested in the equity of companies and had a capital stake. Now, you can buy debt in the form of corporate and government bonds put into ISAs. So, not only does the tax regime give relief to companies in having a leveraged balance sheet but also individuals are encouraged to buy debt in a way they never used to be.\nIn the City we work with debt a lot of the time, but it's siloed away from the greater impact, and that can mean that individuals don't always understand the nuanced implications that it has. I have written before about how the City can serve individuals across the UK, and fundamentally that is about safeguarding and nurturing the economy - understanding the impact of our actions on each person across the UK.\nIn addition, I don't believe that individuals are taught enough about financial structures to have total awareness and autonomy to make personal choices. It's not part of our national curriculum, and perhaps it should be, because if we don't understand personally what we're getting into, then we're vulnerable. Indeed, my daughter, who graduated in Economics, has just completed the CISI’s Fundamentals of Financial Services course and said “I learned so much on that, I don’t know why everyone doesn’t do it at school”.\nUpdating the system\nLast year Sir Douglas Flint’s Digitisation Taskforce was launched to drive forward the modernisation of the UK’s shareholding framework. Part of that involves the dematerialisation of share certificates, for the ultimate beneficial owners to be identified and for intermediaries (stockbrokers, nominee companies, fund managers) to offer access to shareholder rights for voting and so forth.\nI think that has the potential to open some of these conversations around how money and debt work - the fact that as a shareholder you’re a part owner of a business, but as a bond holder you just hold a contract to pay interest and repay the capital. Having published an interim report in July, the deadline for feedback is 25th September 2023 and I would encourage those interested to get involved.\nI think that ultimately if we truly want long term growth that can be sustained, we need to focus on helping people to grow their own money, recognising peoples' values and rights in a constructive way that’s economically beneficial and that makes a tangible difference in individuals' lives. That approach is rooted in strong economic foundations, and to make them truly strong they have to be ethical as well.",

I am acutely aware of how much the City has given me, and how important it is to make sure it's a place where the front door is as wide as possible for anyone with genuine talent, aptitude and commitment. It's a heritage and a future that I think we should all aspire to.\nThis month marks the 30th anniversary of my first day working in the City of London, and it continues to not only be a privilege to work here, but a great joy as well.\nThe City has given me an enormous amount - friends, professional purpose, a community and an extremely fulfilling career, enabling me to look after my family and clients as well as indulge in my fascination with the markets. It's a lifestyle that I continue to be enthusiastic about each day.\nHowever, while I work hard and do my level best to be actively involved in lots of ways, I am also acutely aware of the path that got me here, only part of which is of my own making.\nInspired by the City\nMy family heritage has been intertwined with the City for generations, thanks to our roots in East London. My great grandfather - Percy Augustus Cockman - was a Freeman of the City of London, and his company, Cockman Brothers, was a rather humble fat, bone, horn and tallow chandlers in Stratford’s Marshgate Lane, now on the site of the Olympic Park.\nMy two grandfathers left school at 14 and 16 respectively, and my parents left school at the ages of 16 and 17. I remember going to stay with my grandparents in Wanstead, East London, in their later years, and coming to the City to see glittering spectacle of the Lord Mayor's Show - those stories of Dick Whittington were very much alive in the narrative I grew up around.\nMarket fascination\nI was the first member of my family to go to university and get a degree, but my fascination with the markets began when I was 17 and my Great Aunt gave me a scrip dividend share certificate for about £20 and asked me to look after it.\nI began looking up share prices in the Financial Times in the school library and became thoroughly engrossed. At university in the 1980s I was able to use my student allowance to buy privatisation share issues at the beginning of term and then sell them at end of term to fund my plans for the holidays. I was very much aware that's what I wanted to do for a living.\nWhen I graduated in 1989, I was a beneficiary of the first Lord Mayor's 800th Anniversary Awards Trust, which happened to be founded that year. I applied for and received a grant to do a charity project in Bolivia, helping at a school and an orphanage, which was an eye-opening and enriching experience in a part of the world that I've continued to hold dear.\nA place of opportunity\nI mention all of this because I am aware of both the intergenerational and personal journeys that have led to my involvement in the City. Mine is a privileged story, but it's not one of multigenerational silver spoons, even though I'm sure it can look that way.\nI have said before that the City is a place of opportunity. That now almost allegorical story of Dick Whittington remains something that we should aspire to as a community - preserving the City's long tradition of being a place where people can come from all walks of life to come and make their fortune.\nIt's arguable that the increased requirement for qualifications that proliferated in the 1990s, narrowed the entrance somewhat, but diversity and inclusion agendas are seeking to address that. Ultimately, we want to ensure the City remains a place where the front door is as wide as possible for anyone with genuine talent, aptitude and commitment, because that way everybody benefits.\nThe City has given me the life I always wanted. It was there for me to grasp just as long as I worked hard and showed commitment and capability. I hope we can continue to make sure that opportunity is there for anyone who seeks it out now and going forwards as well.",

They are freedoms that plenty of people in today's world still don't enjoy. It's my wholehearted hope that we never have to ask for that kind of commitment from anyone ever again, but we also owe it to those who have given so much of themselves before us, not to simply remember, but to proactively protect and appreciate the gifts that they gave us.\nThis year, 6th June will mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. The army’s Operation Overlord combined with the Royal Navy’s Operation Neptune involved over 5,000 craft and succeeded in landing 156,000 troops within its first 24 hours, in an operation which became known as the largest amphibious invasion in military history and marking a turning point in the Second World War.\nSuch was the young age of many of the people involved in the events, that we're privileged to have a few voices left to remind us, in person, of what took place. We will most likely not have them for many more years, and it's vital that we commemorate and celebrate their service, as well as that of the people who did not return home. One hopes that the realities of their experience and their sacrifice are not lost or taken for granted as we face what appears to be an extremely turbulent world once again.\nStories that live on\nEvery family has a story - if not relating to D-Day itself, then to the war and its impact on loved ones. Some have become enshrined in pride and even a degree of glamour, but most are tinged with heartache as well, such is the longstanding and unrelenting impact of war, despite the many glorifying movies.\nMy own family is proud of my Great Uncle Gordon, who, having joined the Territorial Army in 1937, was called up early on in the Second World War, and served throughout with the 83rd Field Regiment Royal Artillery. On D-Day he was Mentioned in Despatches for his actions as a liaison officer co-ordinating the Royal Navy’s Operation Neptune bombardment during the Normandy landings. I am fortunate to have his map, with his pencil markings, of the landing beaches and his orders papers from that day and it is moving to see them, hold them and reflect on where they have been.\nHe subsequently went on to be awarded the Military Cross with a citation that reads: \"This officer showed outstanding courage and selfless devotion to duty while serving as Bombardment Liaison Officer during the battle of WESTKAPELLE in WALCHEREN ISLAND on 1st November 1944. Though wounded himself by one of the repeated hits of the superstructure, Captain PENNEY acted as additional ship's officer and later, by continually contacting the wounded Commanding Officer on the upper deck and then returning to the bridge, gave considerable and successful assistance in continuing to fight the ship until she was finally abandoned. Throughout this close action, at point-blank range, Captain PENNEY gave an outstanding example to the Ship's Company.\"\nWhile my own military career was thankfully less eventful, it was a source of pride to be commissioned to the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (QMO) following training at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. My former regiment also has its own illustrious D-Day story in that it was equipped with the famous swimming Duplex Drive Sherman tanks, and were the first tanks ashore on 6th June. Proving that connections are never that far away in these things, Captain (later Major General) Stuart Watson also landed with the regiment that day in 1944. Now, his son, Angus Watson MBE, who is a contemporary and friend of mine, is the Regimental Colonel.\nWhere we are today\nIt's a particularly poignant D-Day commemoration this year, not just because of the many years that have passed since that day, but also because of the events happening in Ukraine, Gaza, and other, less publicised, corners of the world. Talk of a wider war in Europe rumbles away, along with the potential need for mass mobilisation. It seems like something that does not apply to us in what has been a privileged few decades, particularly in the UK.\nHowever, in January the head of the British Army General Sir Patrick Sanders spoke starkly at a military conference, describing the British people as part of a “prewar generation”, saying that the UK needed to broadly follow Stockholm’s example and take “preparatory steps to enable placing our societies on a war footing.”\nIt led to a flurry of reassurances from the Ministry of Defence clarifying that it has no plans for conscription, but indeed the chair of the alliance's military committee of national chiefs Rob Bauer was reported as saying that NATO countries need to be on red alert for war and \"expect the unexpected.\" It's a sentiment that's being echoed in a number of different forums - Grant Shapps too has said the country is moving from a \"post war to a pre-war world\".\nIn the meantime, and in a very real context, Ukraine, which has seen phenomenal levels of volunteering amongst its citizens, has been talking about recalling refugees living in Europe in a bid to boost armed forces.\nTaking nothing for granted\nIn 1938 the total strength of UK service personnel (regulars) stood at 384,000, rising to nearly 1.1 million by the end of 1939. In context, the current strength (as at 1st January 2024) of the UK armed forces is placed at 183,130 including reserve personnel. Notably, in the last month, the Prime Minister announced that the UK is now to boost defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030.\nI do not mention this to raise anxieties and certainly not to predict the future. However, I do believe that the first role of government is to protect the nation. As a society we're very good at protesting the importance of our freedom, but for a long time we have had the privilege of not having to do that much to protect it.\nThe people we celebrate and commemorate on this D-Day anniversary paid an enormous price to protect what we consider to be the most basic of liberties. They are freedoms that plenty of people in today's world still don't enjoy. It's my wholehearted hope that we never have to ask for that kind of commitment from anyone ever again, but we also owe it to those who have given so much of themselves before us, not to simply remember, but to proactively protect and appreciate the gifts that they gave us.",

To achieve that, we have to address the advice gap when it comes to financial choices.\nIn my discussions around the nation's financial health, the question of the advice gap has come up on multiple occasions.\nIn a world where we seek to champion those who work hard, save and contribute to the society around them, it seems incongruous that systems put in place to protect people are, in many cases, preventing them from receiving the support they need to reap the rewards of their judicious economic efforts.\nThe cost of advice\nA large part of the conversation regarding the growing advice gap hinges on cost. It costs financial institutions, advisors and planners so much to meet compliance regulations that they're unable to advise less well off people because they have to charge so much money to comply with regulations, insurance costs and the FSCS levy. As a result of those high costs, it is not economic for those who have smaller pots to pay the price to receive advice and so the situation perpetuates.\nLast year, as part of the joint Advice Guidance Boundary Review with the Government, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wrote:\n\"The FCA’s Financial Lives survey found that only 8% of UK consumers received full financial advice in 2022. Decisions on saving, investing and how to use their pension pots are critically important, and some may struggle to make the right choice for them without help.\"\nWithin the report, Bim Afolami, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The gap between holistic financial advice that is unaffordable for many, and guidance that is free to access but not personal to the consumer, is simply too vast. This so-called ‘advice gap’ is excluding people with modest investments, who are looking for support that doesn’t break the bank. This just isn’t good enough – we have long needed a middle ground that is affordable and accessible.\"\nHow financial advice is communicated\nHowever, the advice gap is not just about cost - it's also about communication within the advisor community. How we present information for nuance, and to inform people better about choices, is essential. For example, the choice to place money in an investment trust (fixed pool of capital) vs an open-ended investment company (a variable pool) is often skewed by the requirements to include certain figures in costs and charges, rather than value.\nIf you're investing in long-term growth businesses and that have less liquidity then in a fixed pool of capital is arguably more beneficial to the variable option. And there are studies that indicate investment trusts generate better returns over a long period, however, they have recently been trading at one of the biggest discounts to net asset value. In effect, we have a situation where we have a better performing and better structured vehicle performing less well than the more flexible option.\nPart of the reason for that ties to advice in that investment trusts are in some instances hamstrung by having to report additional costs in their ongoing charges figure (OCF) to potential investors and independent financial advisors (IFAs). Therefore, optically, the investment trust looks more expensive and isn't recommended, even though it has a lower annual management charge and may be a better structured vehicle for future growth businesses.\nFurthermore, the investment trust is a uniquely British structure and in many ways has been one of the gems of our financial services industry as one of the original vehicles for the democratisation of stock exchange. After all, the UK's first investment trusts appeared in the late 1860s with the original one (The Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust, now F & C Investment Trust) still going strong today.\nAt a time where we worry about the nation's savings rates (the UK savings rate standing at 1.7% - one of the lowest savings rates in the OECD and the lowest level since the 1960s), we should champion those things we've done well in the past. Crucially, we should not confuse ourselves with distracting disclosures that undermine what are very good financial vehicles.\nJust to highlight that this is not an isolated challenge, in another example, the London Stock Exchange plc and other industry participants recently responded to proposals to replace the EU Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) Regulation and create a new UK retail disclosure framework. They noted:\n\"The selective inclusion of 'product costs' relating solely to public companies listed in the UK in aggregated portfolio costs and charges disclosures is fundamentally unsound in a market such as the UK where retail, professional and institutional investors have routine access to a wide range of international equity markets. This unequal treatment creates a range of perverse incentives and adverse outcomes that run contrary to the statutory objectives of UK regulation, including undermining fair competition, providing misleading information to consumers, and damaging market integrity.\"\nCreating an environment for healthy independent choice\nFor individual investment, these things are compounded by a lack of financial education within our system, leaving people in a position where not only can they not access high quality information and advice, but it's very difficult to know what questions to ask to make informed choices.\nNone of us can possibly know all the answers to everything, and all of us will have our own perspectives and opinions depending on how we view the facts. However, it's in knowing the right questions to ask that we can challenge, learn, understand and make independent choices - that comes from education.\nInformed financial decisions should not be solely the domain of those who have large sums to spend. On the contrary, if we want a flourishing economy, then we have to make sure it's one in which all individuals with genuine commitment can also flourish independently.\nI have written before that I have been privileged to grow up with many links to the City, and while mine is a privileged story, it's not one of multigenerational silver spoons. I grew up seeing the City as a place of opportunity, and I think preserving its tradition as a place where people can come from all walks of life to make their fortune should be a collective aspiration.\nCrucially, that aspiration should not only embrace those who work here, but those who seek to invest here as well.",

(pause) This occasion is a hugely significant milestone in the life of a Guild and everyone in this fine Hall will be able to say in years to come that “I was there”.\nThis significance is underlined all the more by the representative Lord Mayor, Sir Alan Yarrow, and the Sheriffs of the City of London, Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli and Christopher Hayward gracing us with their presence, and we would like to thank you for committing the time to join us this evening. Your presence is a huge encouragement to our young Guild, but also underlines the very\nsignificant place that the investment management industry has in the City of London. Welcome!\nOf course, Sir Alan, this is a world that you know well, having had a distinguished career in financial services, serving as Lord Mayor, working for thirty seven years with Dresdner Kleinwort, and subsequently chairing the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment – a body that many of us know well, and perhaps one or two of us know, if we had what might euphemistically be called laps\nof honour on the exam circuit, rather too well! And welcome too to Simon Culhane, CEO of the Institute.\nIt is also a great pleasure to welcome back to our Guild, Sheriff and Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli, who many will recall gave the very stimulating and thought provoking opening remarks at our first topical industry event on Environmental Social Governance in October. And welcome too to his fellow Sheriff Chris Hayward who I know takes a keen interest in the stock market.\nAs a young Guild we were delighted to receive observer status with the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies last year and would like to thank Andrew Marsden, chairman of the FSG, for his support and encouragement of this. Similarly, the Master International Banker – Sir Alan, one of your 4 livery companies - Karina Robinson, who joins us tonight has also been a great encouragement and help, not least with her Company providing one of the panellists at our ESG event. And talking of help, the Master of the Chartered Secretaries, Edward Nicholl, has kindly offered us help from his\nmembers with the drafting of Standing Orders & minute writing. We welcome you all and thank you.\nOne of the objectives for any new Guild is to grow its membership, and I am pleased to report this has risen by about 20% since our Common Hall meeting in July. As we do this we seek to fulfil one of the objectives for Liveries and Guilds in providing fellowship, or in old currency fraternity, and so would encourage all of us to continue inviting friends and colleagues working within the industry to join up.\nOn that note, I would like to extend a special welcome to those investment managers that have joined the Guild since Common Hall in July last year. Can I invite you to stand so that we can suitably recognise you. (clap) Thank you, you may sit down.\nSo, much of this year has been a series of firsts, with our first Common Hall, first Installation Dinner, first topical industry event - and now this is our first annual and civic dinner. I am also delighted to confirm that our charity was approved by the Charity Commission in September at the first attempt – but be warned the Chair of the charity and I are likely to be in touch shortly seeking your support. Speaking of charity, may I also welcome the Master of the Guild of Nurses, Elizabeth Turnbull. The nurses are one up from us in the order of precedence, and so are our big sisters if you will. And they\nhave done an amazing job at raising funds for their charity and are really setting the pace – well done and welcome.\nAnd taking a leaf out of that book can I now take this opportunity to present to Sir Alan a gift of a cheque from the Guild in favour of the Lord Mayor’s Appeal.\nHowever, I think we can also say not everything went quite as smoothly in other parts of the nation last year. When I was making a presentation to an investment committee for a dramatic arts charity just before Christmas, I described the year as something of a pantomime – believing that in March we would be able to say of Brexit “it’s behind you” only to say “oh no it isn’t” and then again in October anticipating going saying “it’s behind you” and then having to say “oh no it isn’t”. And now, as we sit a couple of days away from the latest deadline, maybe we will be able to say “oh yes it is” on this occasion.\nBut despite the uncertainty the industry delivered some very good returns for clients during the year and I hope you and your clients are satisfied with the outcomes. Of course we all know that the best returns are delivered by our old friend hindsight. However as this is now 2020 you will all be enjoying perfect foresight and will have another great year.\nIndeed, I was encouraged earlier this month by the Governor of the Bank of England saying that he was optimistic for the City’s prospects after Brexit and his urging of the government to avoid aligning the UK’s financial regulations and tying our hands by outsourcing the regulation and effectively the supervision of the world’s leading complex financial system to another jurisdiction, when there is so much potential in the City of London to serve the wider world.\nOf course the City as always had a very global perspective and I am reminded that the Huguenots provided the Bank of England with capital and its first governor. Meanwhile, the Guilds and Livery Companies instituted the very first trading standard in the City’s keytrades and professions, with the Goldsmith Bankers, during the late seventeenth century, developing the basic principles of accepting deposits, paying interest and making loans. As a result London has achieved its position as the world capital of finance, with over £9\ntrillion of assets under management in the UK in 2018, and this is likely to breakthrough £10 trillion following the strong run in markets during calendar 2019, making the UK the largest centre of investment management outside the US, and having over a third of all European AUM.\nSo, the UK investment management industry has a central role in the economy as it channels savings into investment and one of the fundamental purposes of investment management is to deliver good outcomes to those clients, and this allows people to save and invest to achieve their future goals and ambitions; whether that is a new car or kitchen, a much needed holiday or a secure retirement.\nI believe there is an urgent need to communicate the valuable social utility provided by this industry, as it serves individuals across the nation, that has in recent years been obscured by the need to prop up the financial system.\nSo, I hope we as a Guild will take the opportunity to represent the industry and the unique opportunity we have to make a positive impact on society through good practice and better understanding, making sure the industry is working for everyone. Whoever you are, wherever you live.\nWith this in mind can I remind all members of the Guild of the first Master’s lecture which will be taking place in April at which we have the Oxford Academic and former Lord Chancellor’s Department fund manager, Michael Ramsden, speaking on “How Much is Enough” and then in May our next topical industry event on diversity.\nAnd so, looking boldly ahead, with past performance a sure guide to future returns, can I invite all members of the Guild of Investment Managers to rise as I propose the toast - The toast is our guests!",

I’m not sure we [as an industry] are very good at articulating this, and people just see us as part of ‘The City’.”\nThe guild also wanted to promote financial literacy more generally and encourage diversity in the sector.\n“That may involve speaking to young people, whether it's in schools or the early years of work, to improve financial awareness and education,” Mr Hughes-Penney said.\n“Equally important is what the industry has to offer in terms of careers. We want the access point to the industry to be as wide-a door as possible, to a diverse group of people – for more people to realise that this is an industry that that welcomes everyone.”\nThe guild is actively looking for more people to become involved, offering a discounted membership fee for those aged under 35. Most of its 80 members joined via word of mouth.\n“There are a couple of things that are really special about guild membership,” Mr Hughes-Penny said.\n“One, is that when you're a part of a livery company or a guild, you are usually part of it for life. When you become a member, you are meeting with people you are likely to know for many, many years. When life is so transitory, having a place that is more consistent and permanent adds real value to relationships.\n“Secondly, for a young person, you could come in as a 26 or 27-year-old and be at a function, presentation, or dinner sitting alongside a very senior fund manager, who you might otherwise only see in a formal setting. [You have the opportunity] to build a relationship, ask questions and learn from those that have got much more experience.”\nThe guild runs social events throughout the year as well as more industry-centric occasions: In November it held a seminar focused on ESG matters, and has another on diversity planned for May.\nMembership involves participating in events, and as with all non-profit organisations, there are various other volunteer posts to be filled – “but, we realise people are busy, and it’s very flexible in terms of the commitment,” Mr Hughes-Penney said.\nTo find out more, and to become a member, visit the Guild of Investment Managers’ website.\nThis article was originally published on TheWealthNet under the authorship of Alexandra Newlove, 20/12/2019",

From the Council of Nicaea to modern London, its relevance endures.\nAs Christians worldwide gather this year to celebrate Christ's resurrection on Easter Sunday, we also mark a significant milestone in church history: the 1700th anniversary of the Nicene Creed. Formulated at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD under Emperor Constantine, this foundational statement of Christian orthodoxy has shaped theology, worship, and even government institutions for seventeen centuries.1\nThe Council and the Creed: A Response to Division\nThe Council of Nicaea wasn't convened as a routine ecclesiastical gathering, but as an urgent response to theological controversy. The Arian dispute—concerning whether Christ was fully divine or a created being—threatened not only theological unity but social stability across the Roman Empire.2 The resulting creed articulated with remarkable precision the church's understanding of Christ's nature.\nThe most contentious and significant phrase was the declaration that Christ is \"of one substance with the Father\" (homoousios in Greek)—establishing that Jesus shares the same divine essence as God the Father.3 This seemingly technical point carried profound implications for Christian understanding of salvation and God's nature as holy trinity.\nThe full Creed (in its finalised form after the Council of Constantinople in 381) reads in part:\n\"We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made...\nFor our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\"4\nThis carefully crafted language represented not merely theological hair-splitting, but a profound articulation of the central mystery of Christian faith: that in Christ, God himself had entered human experience, suffered death, and triumphed over it, as we celebrate this Easter.\nBuilding on the Apostles' Creed\nWhile the earlier Apostles' Creed provided an important baptismal confession, the Nicene Creed ventured into deeper theological territory. The Apostles' Creed affirms belief in \"Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,\" the Nicene Creed expands this, establishing Christ's eternal relationship with the Father, and his role in creation.5\nMoreover, the Nicene formulation provides a more robust pneumatology (doctrine of the Holy Spirit), proclaiming: \"We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.\"6\nThe Creed and the City: London's Christian Foundations\nThe influence of the Nicene Creed extends beyond church walls into civic structures, particularly evident in London's historical institutions. The City of London, with its ancient guilds and governance, developed within a Christian framework where the Nicene understanding of God's nature informed moral and ethical considerations in trade and justice.7\nThe Old Bailey, London's Central Criminal Court, stands as a testament to how Christian principles shaped jurisprudence. The court's historic commitment to impartial judgement reflects a moral framework informed by the Nicene understanding of divine justice and mercy.8 The figure of Lady Justice atop the Old Bailey dome, representing impartial judgement, exists in a cityscape dominated by St. Paul's Cathedral—a visual reminder of how Christian conceptions of truth and justice informed civic values.\nThe City's livery companies and guilds, many originally formed as religious fraternities, often included the recitation of creeds in their ceremonies and governance procedures.9 Their charitable functions—still evident today—stem from a Christian understanding of human dignity rooted in the Nicene affirmation that humanity carries special significance as the object of divine redemption.\nGuildhall itself, the administrative centre of the City, hosted religious observances where the Creed would have been recited for centuries. Its architecture and art reflect a cosmology shaped by Nicene Christianity—from medieval carvings to Victorian stained glass, the visual language presupposes a worldview where Christ's divinity and resurrection form the cornerstone of meaning.10\nA Declaration for \"Post-Truth\" Times\nThe Nicene Creed's relevance extends remarkably into our contemporary climate which has been characterised as \"post-truth.\" The Council fathers weren't engaging in abstract philosophical discourse—they were determining whether Christianity made claims about actual reality or merely offered another subjective religious perspective.11\nIn declaring that Christ is \"true God from true God\" and affirming his bodily resurrection, the Creed insists that Christian faith makes objective claims about the nature of reality itself. As philosopher Charles Taylor notes in his seminal work \"A Secular Age,\" this represents a fundamental challenge to both ancient and modern forms of relativism.12\n\"He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end,\" proclaims the Creed—a statement that places all human affairs, including our modern technological and political systems, under transcendent judgement. This stands in stark contrast to contemporary tendencies to reduce all truth claims to matters of personal preference or social construction.13\nEaster and The Creed\nThe resurrection stands at the centre of the Nicene confession: \"he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures.\" Without this affirmation, the careful language about Christ's divine nature would be merely philosophical speculation rather than the foundation of living faith.14\nThe Creed reminds us that Easter isn't merely about spring, chicks, and chocolate, but about new life. When we proclaim \"Christ is risen\" this Easter, we affirm with the authors of the Nicene Creed that this resurrection is not just symbolic but substantive—that the same divine Word through whom all things were made has conquered death itself.15\nAs we mark its 1700th anniversary, perhaps the most appropriate response is not merely historical reflection but renewed commitment to the truths the Creed articulates. In a fragmented world seeking authentic connection, the Nicene Creed offers not just ancient words, but an enduring vision of reality centred on a God who enters human experience to transform it from within.16",

One of his many legacies after 12 years of service (which followed 25 years in Chelmsford Diocese), was his update of the historic book, the Rules for the Conduct of Life into contemporary language. The original ‘Rules’ is traditionally given to all new Freemen of the City of London on their admission by the Chamberlain, and it is a text that I frequently reflect upon, both personally and professionally.\nTimeless values in a modern city\nThe original text was first published in 1740, derived from a document by a former Lord Mayor, Sir John Barnard, as a set of standards for Freemen of The City of London. Reverend Parrott commented on the release of his revised edition, that: \"Despite its age, it is as relevant today as any book on leadership and business management.\"\nThe first few weeks of 2023 have been a time to reflect upon the year ahead and consider how one wants to approach it professionally and personally. I have found the Rules for the Conduct of Life to be a source of sage advice and guidance. In Parrott's revised version, 36 short rules across 10 chapters have been reworked for the context of contemporary corporate governance, sustainability and social impact. It offers helpful and thought-provoking insights that I think we can all benefit from.\nHumanity and economy\nIt begins with 'Being independent together', which is perhaps a most poignant place to start as we navigate international relationships and a post-Brexit world from a position of global community as well as autonomy. Meanwhile, at home with economic and cost of living challenges, we have the professional, ethical and human responsibility of both The City to the nation and individuals to help the economy, as well as one another, in their experience of collective obstacles.\nIn a world where there’s so much that remains in flux, eternal values, by definition, don’t change over time, and I expect to reflect on the Rules further over the coming months in order to seek wisdom in navigating the path ahead.\nIf you don’t have a copy of the original Rules because you’re not a Freeman of the City, you could become a Freeman. Or, if you would like a copy of the updated version, you can find it at the St. Lawrence Jewry office.",

Naturally, we all have questions, and having worked with my colleagues to try to find some tangible answers for everyone within the Ward of Cheap.\nRecent weeks, and in particular the events of last week, have understandably caused high levels of anxiety. Firstly, for the health and wellbeing of our friends and loved ones, and also because of the impact coronavirus is having on businesses and jobs in the City and across the UK. Naturally, we all have questions, and having worked with my colleagues to try to find some tangible answers for everyone within the Ward of Cheap, I wanted to draw attention to what is being done, where you can find support and the possible pathways ahead.\nFirstly, I feel it’s important to emphasise, that while there are undoubtedly difficult times ahead, we have all been through difficult times before and we have many reasons to be quietly confident in our collective abilities to pull through. This I believe wholeheartedly, and will be doing everything within my power to facilitate.\nWe have good reason to look to the future\nIn a joint statement by the Lord Mayor and Policy Chair last week, William Russell and Catherine McGuinness offered reassurance to all living and working in The City, saying:\n“We will be supporting the City, to help employees, businesses and the financial system. We will be sustaining our work on long-term competitiveness, for example by continuing our climate action work. And we will be speeding the recovery so we are ready, whenever the moment comes, to relaunch a full and strong economy.”\nTogether, they reminded us of the strengths that are the foundations of The City’s proudest strengths and achievements. Foundations that we often forget the real value of in times of affluence, but which really do offer a supportive base on which we are able to hold fast when things get tough. They said: “London will always be one of the world’s leading financial centres, a city of global talent with a highly-skilled workforce and more international HQs than any other European city.”\nIt is for those reasons we can be optimistic amidst the caution and careful thought about how we manage the current situation and work towards recovery in the not too distant future.\nThere is support available and to come for businesses and organisations of all sizes\nUnderstandably, many have contacted both myself and colleagues at Guildhall, looking for answers and a sense of direction. Of course, information and advice is being updated regularly, in line with the situation and Government responses. However, you may be reassured that action is most certainly being taken to keep business in The City running, albeit remotely, and that the challenges of organisations of all sizes, and the people within them, are being taken into careful consideration.\nIt is in our collective interest for us all to be cared for. In an environment used to high levels of competition, this is certainly a situation where care for all is paramount. For example, in terms of support for hard-hit industries throughout the City of London and the UK, particularly SMEs, the Chamberlain’s Department and The City Bridge Trust are looking into this.\nAdditionally, The City Bridge Trust is looking into what support may be provided for charities and third sector organisations with the help of Philanthropy Director, Fiona Rawes. They have already pledged an initial £1,000,000, as advised by Alderman Gowman (Vice-Chair of CBT) on Tuesday last week.\nThere are also measures in place to look into setting up a virtual engagement programme focused on key markets and sectors in London. This was already underway anyway in light of Brexit, and now has even more reason to be expedited. Where visits overseas were planned, communications will continue, but in a virtual capacity instead.\nStaying connected as more information comes to light\nNaturally, there will be more information to come imminently, but the main message is clear. Business will continue, both short and long term. There is and will be support available, and if you have questions, I myself am available to constituents in the Ward of Cheap, and my colleagues at Guildhall are also available to support and advise wherever possible.\nIn addition the local church ministers, Rev David Parrott at St Lawrence Jewry and Rev Paul Kennedy at St. Vedast, are both available to talk and pray with members of the community. Rev Paul reminds us that:\n“In Sunday’s Gospel reading Jesus spits on the earth, makes paste and rubs it in the eyes of a blind man, this restoring his sight. No social distancing and not a sanitiser in sight. We are social animals: touch, embrace, shared wine, the Mothers’ Day meal form our natural rhythm. The journey of faith transfers the centre of attention away from ourselves to the Other; whether that Other is neighbour, rough sleeper or God. This virus changes everything as we isolate. Like many in business, I wrote letters telling people not to come into work afraid for the hopes, dreams and rents of these young Londoners. We’re aware of illness and human frailty but “I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels or demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord.”\nAt St. Vedast we offer mass most days and are asked to pray for the ill, the fearful, NHS staff, students missing exams.\nPanic buying hits the news but my experience has been of kindness and compassion. The friendly enquiry about how I really feel. Mothering Sunday traditionally starts with the word, “rejoice” and the encouragement “be joyful all who were mourning”. This will come.”\nIf you would like to contact me or the Common Councilmen, please do so and we will endeavour to answer questions wherever we can.\nWishing you good health.",

Over the past six years, I've navigated changes globally, serving our community through initiatives like the Ward of Cheap Business Breakfasts and representing impactful investments. I'm humbled by the support shown in my re-election and am committed to serving the Ward and the City to the best of my abilities. Thank you for this opportunity, and I eagerly anticipate continuing our work together.\nMy Lord Mayor, Deputy, voters, and friends,\nI stand before you today with a sense of gratitude and excitement from being a candidate in the election of Alderman for the Ward of Cheap and now as the newly elected Alderman. It is an honour to have your trust and support in continuing to serve this vibrant community.\nI started work just off Cheapside next to St Mary le Bow; when I joined the Haberdashers' Company, the Hall was located down the road off Gresham Street. I have dealings with businesses in the Ward, and of course, I will shortly be moving into 30 Gresham Street in the heart of the Ward and the City. I stand ready to continue working for the Ward and the City.\nReflecting on the journey over the past six years, I am reminded of the contested Aldermanic election held nearly six years ago, where I stood alongside six other candidates. It is amazing to reflect on how much has changed over that time in the City, the UK and globally. Markets have risen, fallen and bounced. We've navigated the pandemic, adopted hybrid working, mourned the loss of the late Queen and celebrated the accession of King Charles III.\nIn the midst of that, I have sought to serve each of those contexts, and let me give you brief examples; here in the Ward, my Common Councillor colleagues and I have answered and responded to many questions and enquiries from local voters, workers and residents. In addition, I re-introduced the Ward of Cheap Business Breakfasts that take place two or three times a year, building community alongside the Ward of Cheap Club and the Cheapside Business Alliance.\nI am the Corporation's nominated Board member of the Impact Investing Institute, which leads the way in the important work of promoting impact investments that are made to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. With a global perspective, I was delighted to be able to bring in the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, representing some $6trn for its first-ever global summit into Guildhall last year, an event which is due to be repeated this year.\nAs I sought re-election, I aimed to build on the foundations laid down over the last six years. The fact that no one stood against me in this election is not taken for granted. I am grateful for the unwavering support of my colleagues, friends, and, most importantly, the voters of the Ward of Cheap.\nI extend my deepest thanks to the Lord Mayor for presiding over this Ward Mote and my Deputy and Common Councillor colleagues for their continuous support. We are a strong and united team, and thank you, Alastair, for your generous words. The Corporation's officers, particularly Alice and the Electoral Services office, for their efficiency and helpfulness in this electoral process.\nTo the voters from across the Ward, those who are present today and those who have supported me over the last six years, I appreciate your trust and encouragement. The Ward of Cheap Club has been a strong and supportive community, and I am honoured to see the President here today.\nA special thank you to Fr. James and St. Lawrence Jewry for providing not only spiritual guidance but also the venue for today's Mote. And last but by no means least, thank you to my wife. I am delighted that my wife, Elspeth, a former City corporate lawyer, has been with me every step of the way. I know she is very committed to supporting me in the role of Alderman, for which I am truly grateful.\nAs I stand before you today, as the newly elected Alderman, I am acutely aware of the responsibilities ahead. The Alderman's role involves providing leadership to the Ward team and the wider City, encompassing financial, legal, and other professional services, SMEs, and the Livery. The Court of Aldermen is also the pool of candidates from which the Lord Mayor is selected. I am committed to building on my unique experiences for the good of the Ward and the City, and I stand ready to serve in high office if or when called upon.\nThank you all for this tremendous opportunity, and I look forward to continuing the work we have started together.",

Spears rank UHNW and HNW wealth managers, private bankers and the leading recruitment consultants that work in this area. As well as London one can also find their recommendations of advisers in financial centres such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Channel Islands.\nAs Spears stated \"Robert Hughes-Penney’s education and military career have given him a broad knowledge of cultures, people and markets. It is perhaps this diversity which enables him to help such a wide range of clients. ‘Some are busy professionals, some are entrepreneurs, some are retired, some just starting out in life,’ he says. ‘They have one thing in common – they want to face the future with confidence.’ Hughes-Penney wants to use wealth planning to bring families together: ‘One of a wealth manager’s most rewarding experiences is when the client relationship is deepened as a result. Ideally, wealth management – like wealth itself – should transition smoothly from one generation to the next.’\"",

The Bridgewater Hall is full of students and families celebrating their achievements, and as I stand here I can feel the sense of pride, hope and ambition that radiates off these new graduates.\nPro-Vice-Chancellor, guests and graduands...\nGood morning! And thank you for your warm welcome and words of introduction.\nAs I walked to the Bridgewater Hall this morning the buzz and sense of anticipation was palpable on the streets of Manchester, and as I stand here and look out on the Hall I can see lots of glowing, proud, smiling faces – and that’s just the family and friends! The new graduates are positively radiant!\nYou will already, I hope, have had lots of people congratulating you on your wonderful achievement, but can I take this opportunity to congratulate each of you, and I mean you, and you and you, on what you have done. It is truly magnificent. [Let’s give it up again for all the graduates!]\nToday is the day when you walk out of here, that you can stand a little taller with your head held high, rightly proud and confident in your achievements; ready to start of the next chapter of your life. And I am sure yours is a life with much potential.\nIt is a great honour to be here with you today, sharing a small part of your journey and providing some encouragement and tips for the next chapter of life.\nOf course, I am truly thankful to Manchester Met, because it was this amazing institution that gave me the opportunity to do a degree, the first person in my family to get a degree, seeing what I hope was some a spark of potential, despite not very good A levels, and that’s an understatement. And in allowing me to do a degree I was given a springboard to my career that’s been stimulating and rewarding.\nImmediately after graduating I joined the army, went to Sandhurst and served in Canada, Germany and the UK for four years. I then started work for a firm of stockbrokers in the City of London. And I’ve been in that business ever since. People often ask me what I like about the job, and I say that I like to know what’s going on, and I am essentially paid to read the newspaper, or social media now, and then make a few decisions! Of course, there’s a bit more to it than that and it might appear daunting when you are responsible the 100’s of millions of pounds. But it started with modest amounts and grew over time. And I’d encourage you to find and pursue the thing you enjoy doing that you too can grow, over time with diligence and application. As the expression goes; from small acorns…\nI know in the hall today there are graduates in economics, policy and international business, operations, technology, events and hospitality. Each of these areas has major challenges at the moment; whether it is the reimaging of capitalism as a force for good that encompasses human flourishing in the round, not just making money, or ensuring technology is developed by design, not by default, or encouraging people to come together post covid because we are social beings that need one another; one body many parts. I wish you well in making a difference in your area of expertise.\nI’ve also had the opportunity to branch out over time and endeavour to make a difference; sitting on the Boards of professional institutes, charities, and nearly four years ago being elected as an Alderman of the City of London, which means I support the Lord Mayor of London, who is a global figure as the UK’s ambassador for the City of London and UK financial and professional services. The Lord Mayor brings the best of Britain to the world and the best of the world to Britain. Across the UK the financial and professional services employ 2.3m people, two thirds outside London in cities like Manchester, producing over 10% of the UK’s entire economic output and 13% of the nation’s tax contribution.\nIt is a huge privilege to serve as an Alderman - we form part of the City Corporation committed to bringing people together to solve the big problems across the globe, working closely and influencing with local and national governments and businesses, I hope for good.\nIt was 33 years ago I was sitting where you are. So what would I say to my young self, or to you if we were chatting 121?\nBe constantly curious, in people, in things and in ideas, be interested, be kind to yourself and be kind to others.\nThere was an interesting survey I read about recently that contrasted character competence with technical competence; and businesses often default to technical competence when recruiting people, despite recognising that ultimately character competence is what is important – the technical bits can be learned. So, as you go into the world be people of character competence; learn to be grateful for what you have; including family, friends, colleagues, teachers and lecturers that have brought you to this place today, to be generous and remember to practice the Golden rule; do to others as you would have them do to you.\nSo, in concluding can I say again my warmest and most sincere congratulations to all the new graduates, please keep in touch with Manchester Metropolitan University and the alumni programme and I wish you the very best of success and happiness for your career and life ahead.\nThank you.",

The work of the ward had been focused on building community among workers and businesses in the City. In collaboration with the CBA and the City of London, the ward will continue to work toward maximising efforts to support London's businesses and increase economic prosperity.\nGood evening, fellow “Cheapsiders” and welcome to the CBA Annual Report Launch 2022.\nI’m Robert Hughes-Penney, and it’s my privilege to be the Alderman for the Ward of Cheap; one of the leading business wards in the City of London. As your Alderman, I am in a position to use my experience to represent you, your business and interests.\nA few of the main priorities for our Ward have included, building community and networks amongst workers and businesses. Indeed, I, my fellow Ward members and the Ward Club have partnered with the CBA to run a series of successful business breakfasts with the objective of building community. In addition, we seek to champion sustainable and responsible investment, and harnessing the City’s traditional expertise with its growing technology skills to create the world’s leading fintech hub. So, I very much look forward to meeting and working with you all in the future.\nI’m delighted to be here tonight and at the outset, I’d like to thank the Cheapside Business Alliance Executive Team, for the invitation to speak this evening but most importantly to thank you for the great work you do in supporting us and the businesses we represent. And a thank you as well to Saddlers’ Hall for hosting this wonderful event in your magnificent Hall.\nThe City of London has never been a place that has stood still, and while its calling card for centuries has been its role as a business hub, it has always been able to adapt and respond to change. We are aware that what lies ahead is a period of uncertainty and difficulty with inflation, the rise in energy prices and the recovery from the pandemic encouraging workers and visitors returning to the city. However, we continue to remain positive and are confident that the CBA and City of London’s close collaboration can add maximum value in providing support to the business community and increasing economic prosperity once again.\nThe launch of the City Corporation’s new Destination City programme is expected to shift perceptions about the Square Mile, attract new audiences and ensure the city evolves to remain a world-class destination, aligning well with aspirations of CBA. The launch is due to take place on Saturday 15th of October 2022 and is expected to be an immensely impactful event, hugely benefiting the retail and hospitality sectors within CBA and an annual commitment of £2.5 million towards the project. The event will be inspired by the mythologies and hidden tales of the Square Mile, where the public will venture on a thrilling journey of discovery to tell the City’s story through creative theatre.\nI’m proud that Cheapside is one of the longest-running BIDs in the City and continues to receive a significant amount of support from the City Corporation, which allows us to deliver great results for local businesses and the wider community. The two newest BIDs in the EC and Fleet Street Quarter area’s went live in April of this year, and we wish them every success too. And should the planned Culture Mile BID be successful when it goes to ballot shortly, these five BIDs will be generating an aggregate BID levy income of around £9 million per year, with this investment supporting projects and programmes identified by the local business communities as priorities.\nSo, thank you again for coming to the CBA Annual Report Launch – we are here to help you prosper and thrive.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_a-city-of-compassion-on-a-global-scale/content_11.html": "26 October 2021\nA City of compassion on a global scale\nWhen we think of the City, we think of commerce, business and career ladders, but community, charity and compassion also play a significant role both within the City itself and as part of its global endeavours.\nThe bread which you hold back actually belongs to the hungry;\nThe garment which you lock in your chest belongs to the naked;\nThe shoes which rot in your storehouse belong to the bare footed;\nAnd the money which you are hiding ... belongs to the needy.\nThus you do a great injustice to all those whom you could succour.\n- St. Basil of Caesarea, 4th century\nThe City of London is associated with many things, but it’s not often we talk about it in the context of care and compassion. We think of commerce, business and career ladders, but community, charity and compassion also play a significant role both within the City itself and as part of its global endeavours.\nTo me, this is as important as any other factor in the work, health and long-term success of the UK’s business centre; as a community we have the power to do great things when we bring our different skills and talents together to do good. We are increasingly aware of the impact of our actions and investments on the world around us and as donors and/or stewards of capital, whether big or small, we can take an active interest in how our funds are being deployed. There is also real psychological benefit for the giver/donor in developing a spirit of generosity, besides the obvious benefit to the recipient(s).\nWhile the past 18 months have presented a particularly important need to care for one another on multiple levels, it’s an ongoing need that many individuals and organisations work tirelessly to provide. The Lord Mayor’s Appeal is well known for its perennial efforts to support the changing needs of the City, and the people involved have worked exceptionally hard to pivot and scale to meet those requirements since March 2020.\nThis year’s Impact Report highlighted their efforts with charities and groups including The Power of Inclusion, This is Me, She Can Be, City Giving Day, the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, Samaritans, Place2Be and OnSide YouthZones. The Lord Mayor’s City Giving Day alone raised an estimated £300,000+ for charities and good causes and there are now over 100 Samaritans City Hub volunteers, with a further 100 having started or about to embark on their training.\nGlobal Mercy\nArguably one of the best examples I can think of when it comes to the power of this community to do good is the work of Mercy Ships, which launched its new hospital ship this year - the Global Mercy. It is the world’s largest non-governmental hospital ship.\nHaving been on the Board and seen the wonderful work that the faith-based international development organisation has done through its Africa Mercy ship, it’s wonderful to see the next one coming along, facilitated by the ongoing support - financial and otherwise - of so many in the City of London. Mercy Ships Chairman, Henry Clarke, mentioned that the UK has consistently been the second biggest contributor to the organisation after USA for more than 40 years.\nFor those who are unaware of the work of Mercy Ships, they are a wonderful example of what can be done when talent, determination and compassion come together. It was started in 1978 by a couple who wanted to take hospital ships to the poorest nations around the world, to bring hope and healing through surgical intervention. Their work currently focuses on Africa as this is where the need is currently most acute.\nStark facts include:\nGlobally, five billion people have no access to safe and affordable surgery when they need it.\nAn estimated 16.9 million people die each year from a lack of safe surgery.\nAccess is worst in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, where nine of ten people cannot access basic surgical care.\nMercy Ships seek to address these issues through three clear objectives:\n1) Transforming lives through surgery.\nOften these surgeries are the primary barrier for people to get into work or be accepted by a community. They don’t just heal the person, but also their families and communities as well. It gives people a chance at a future.\n2) Training.\nMercy Ships seek to train indigenous doctors in surgery and preventative medicine in order to proactively work towards eliminating the need for Mercy Ships work.\n3) Healthcare systems.\nThey aim to help countries to build their own healthcare systems for long-term, sustainable care.\nTheir work depends entirely on volunteers, from doctors to teachers, hairdressers to plumbers, all of whom serve the communities on board the ships. Each person pays for their own flights out to Africa and is supported through the patronage of companies or family. In context, the chief surgeon, Dr Gary Parker, has been on board for 32 years. Volunteers even give their own blood on board the ship.\nThe Global Mercy is game changing in its size and its facilities – not least because of the wealth of teaching space that it includes for training local doctors. It’s expected that within its 50-year service, more than 150,000 lives will be changed onboard through surgery alone. I could go on, but I suggest you visit their website if you are interested in finding our more –\nSupporting the supporters\nThe other thing that I think we’re becoming increasingly aware of with the rise in understanding around mental health, is the need to support the people who are so selflessly supporting us. One of the organisations that is quietly vital for this is the Clergy Support Trust.\nThey have been in existence for nearly 400 years, providing financial support to clergy and their families. That might be grants for household needs, such as laptops (especially with home schooling during the pandemic), holidays, car-related and general living expenses, or in the form of emergency grants (they helped over 1600 families across all grants last year alone). In the last few years, they have also started to provide non-financial support, primarily delivered through partners, such as counselling, help with insomnia and debt management services. A growing area of support is also in preventative work – especially when it comes to mental health or financial distress.\nChief Executive, Ben Cahill-Nicholls, describes it as a charity (independent of the Church), that:\n“Exists to serve people who are serving everyone else. That’s been important forever but in the last 18 months, clergy and their families have, like everybody else, experienced turbulence and isolation. Their roles can be joyful, but also demanding and exhausting. Like everybody, clergy and their families do sometimes need support, which is where the Trust comes in. It’s a huge privilege to serve those who serve others.”\nIn my professional and civic roles in the City, I am privileged to meet and work alongside a number of truly inspiring individuals and organisations, and importantly to see how important each piece of the puzzle is to a number of collective goals. Yes, the City is a centre of business, but alongside their successes, corporate organisations have an opportunity and a role in providing care and support where it’s needed most – both at home and around the world. It’s fantastic to see how many take up that mantle, often quietly and without self-aggrandisement. In that it really is a community capable of immense compassion.",

It is a great privilege and honour.\nThose that have served may recall either from junior NCO cadres or Sandhurst, or equivalent training, as I do, the military “methods of instruction” approach to teaching. For those less familiar with the military it is; tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you’ve told them.\nSo, today we are going to rightly recognise the day, Remembrance Day, those who have fallen, what it means in the context of the world today, what does the bible say about that and how are we now called to live.\nToday we honour those who laid down their lives for us; untold numbers in two World Wars, and conflicts since – the Malayan Emergency, Korea, Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Gulf War, Bosnia and more recently Iraq and Afghan.\nIn fact, when I was serving there had only been one year, since WWII when the Armed Forces had not suffered a death on operations – only one year in something like 50 years when a loved one, a son, a father, a brother, a friend had not been taken from their family – maybe you have been affected by such a loss…\nAnd in the nearly 30 years since I “retired” and put away my khaki, there has again been only one year without an operational fatality, which brings the total to nearly 7,200 British military deaths, in conflicts. A number that now includes women, daughters and wives, as well as men. 7,200 families who have grieved.\nAnd in addition, there are many times that number who have been injured, scared, physically and mentally by their military service and sacrifice.\nToday, we remember and honour their memory. We recall their sacrifice. We thank God for our deliverance, gained at such a dreadful price.\nIn the context of today, what does this mean for us? Well we are fortunate recipients and beneficiaries of the sacrifices made by the fallen. And in that way we undoubtedly stand on the shoulders of those that have gone before; drawing on the well know Kohima Epitaph, we are able to go into our tomorrow because they gave their today.\nI had a great uncle, who prior to the war was a bank manager with Nat West, he served in the Royal Artillery as a Forward Observation Officer, landed on D-day, I have his maps of the beaches with his pencil markings at home. He was mentioned in dispatches on that day, and was later awarded the Military Cross for actions in Holland. In many ways he was an inspiration to me, and I am sure you have individuals who have been a significant influence in your life, whether they were in the military or not.\nIn that way we have relied on those that have gone before, to stand on the shoulders of those that have gone before - just as others will look to us and rely on the foundations that we provide. In that way the sacrifices, and I don’t say this in any way to diminish the grief and pain of loss, lead to blessing, which compounds with each generation. And if there is anywhere that I go where an explanation of the benefits of compound interest do not have to be explained it is the Bank of England.\nSo, while some have been called on to die for their friends.\nThe rest of us have been called to live for ours and those that follow us.\nAnd whilst we remember and are inspired by the sacrifice of these individuals and contemplate how we should live our lives, for those around us, and those that follow us, let us also look to the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, who died for each and every one of us, and our forebears, and our successors. Jesus who had done no wrong gave up his place alongside the Father in heaven, to be sacrificed, so that we, who are imperfect and get so many things wrong, could be made right and reconciled with God who is perfect.\nIn the verses from the prophet Micah, the Lord’s temple is described as being established like a mountain among the mountains – the Everest in the Himalyas. The temple was the greatest thing in the religion of the Jews, it was the mountain pinnacle in their scenery, rising above all competition, for all to see and recognise – and as such be a place of such importance and attractiveness that the peoples will stream to it because in their hearts and minds they recognise that being in God’s presence is an attractive and good place to be – somewhere that you will recognise in your own experience where the air is clean and sweet, somewhere where you get to see a perspective on and across the world, a perspective that is freeing and releasing.\nYou can look down and see the mountain paths and the best routes to take to navigate the journeys ahead.\nAnd although we are not facing kinetic war in this country today I am sure we recognise the threats and challenges to stability and peace both societally internally and domestically and with the changing geo-political tectonic plates internationally. I am often guilty of taking offence, and I dare say you are too. But we also see it at a macro level. And I often remember that we express it as taking offence not giving offence. But I know I am most likely to take offence when I am not feeling loved. And so as we hear and read of stories about people or nations taking offence let’s remember that it is the absence of love that creates this fertile ground for offence and division.\nAs those that have read on in the Bible to the Gospel of John will know, we read that God is love, and that God so loved the world that he gave his only son, Jesus, who was sacrificed so that we could be reconciled with God.\nAnd this is what is happening when we read of the swords being beaten into ploughshares, and spears turned into pruning hooks – this is not an instruction to go into our workshops and do this in our own strength, or misguided wisdom that our human efforts can overcome human nature; it is not an invitation to naivety in the face of aggressors, but is a recognition of what occurs in our hearts day by day when we live in the presence of the Lord and accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour.\nAs we honour those that have sacrificed their all for us today, let us all also honour Christ who gave his all for each one of us, our friends and neighbours, by honouring Him, accepting Him as our Lord and saviour, and walking in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.\nAnd so today as we remember of the great love shown by those whose names we honour today we also consider what that means in the context of today, to love and serve, to bless those around us, and those coming on after us so that they may be blessed by standing on our shoulders, just as we are so incredibly blessed by the love and sacrifice of those that have gone before us, and critically first to know and honour God so that through Jesus’s redeeming sacrifice we might be equipped in our hearts to live as He would want us to.\nOne of my favourite Bible verses is Jeremiah 6v16. Let me share it with you because I think it applies to you and today; “stand at the crossroads and look. Ask for the ancient paths and where the best road is. Walk in it and you will live in peace.” Whenever I read it I associate it with the City and specifically Bank junction. And so when you leave the Bank tonight, and when you come and go in the days ahead, as you walk across Bank junction, remember that verse; stand at the crossroads and look, ask for the ancient paths and where the best road is. Walk in it and you will live in peace.\nAmen.",

Many of you kindly gave both positive and thoughtful feedback with points that certainly develop that conversation, some of which I wanted to take time to respond to.\nLast month I wrote about some of my views on the nation's financial health and areas of potential focus for improvement. Many of you kindly gave both positive and thoughtful feedback with points that certainly develop that conversation, some of which I wanted to take time to respond to in greater depth.\nThe critical nature of how growth is achieved\nOne particular point from Robert Westcott, said: \"We have somehow evolved to running the whole nation on debt which is the opposite of hundreds of years of wisdom. As if, somehow, by just clever financial manipulations, we can magically create value out of nothing.\"\nThis rings particularly true for me. How stable and sustainable growth is achieved is the critical factor and arguably too much of our economic growth has been based on leverage and borrowing rather than building firm foundations and compounding returns on assets. There will always be a need to borrow money to bridge finances but growth in borrowing and leverage also brings much greater likelihood of financial instability. So, we need to harness a firmer, more incremental nature to the growth we achieve. That’s because the problem is that leverage that leads to the bifurcation of who benefits, growing divisions between the haves and the have nots as well as creating a more unstable economy.\nWhen the current model topples, and it is a question of when, the poor will suffer the most. Some of the solution around that is to do with financial structures and tax subsidies/tax breaks, including the fact that debt is treated more favourably than equity.\nThe advice gap\nPeter Jenkins said: \"The stats on so many families with virtually no savings is truly alarming. The subject should be taught in schools particularly to sixth formers about to hit the real world.\"\nMeanwhile, James MacDonald-Smith states poignantly: “And the advice gap only grows…”\nThese points on education and advice I think are so vital at all ages. There are courses available, but they are not part of mainstream education. Rathbones runs a financial awareness programme for 16-24 year olds as well as versions for adults, while the CISI Fundamentals of Financial Services course is accessible to those in years 12 and 13 and gives a very helpful context.\nNonetheless it's true that the advice gap grows, and in part this is because of the regulatory environment. It costs financial institutions, advisors and planners so much to meet compliance regulations that they're unable to advise less well off people because they have to charge so much money to comply with regulations, insurance costs and the FSCS levy. As a result of those high costs, it is not economic for those who have smaller pots to pay the price to receive advice and so the situation perpetuates.\nFor many people, if we don't get good financial education from our parents then we don't get it from anywhere because the advice simply isn't accessible. It's all very well regulating businesses but if it’s to the point where that business can't look after customers then it effectively disenfranchises parts of the market - and probably those in need of advice first.\nThe unintended consequence of quantitative easing\nLinking to this is something I've thought about a lot recently. When I was growing up you could go to the Post Office with your savings book and put some birthday money or Christmas money into a savings account. Some might even remember having savings stamps. There's now no equivalent, trusted institution where people can go with modest sums and learn the art of saving.\nPart of that change is also probably the product of the interest rate environment over the last decade. I tried to do the same thing with my children 15 years ago, but there's no compounding to see, so they understandably questioned the point at the time because they couldn't see it accumulating. It's arguably the unintended consequence of quantitative easing that's discouraged people from saving, compounded by facing growing costs.\nI have pondered whether or not there's scope for something like the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) to be the kind of trusted vehicle for savings that the Post Office was a decade ago. As things stand, the NEST savings rate is 8%, which, while still lower than perhaps desirable, is a good start. In 2023 NEST had savings of nearly £30 billion under management. If you take a 6% rate of return, that amount will double in just over 10 years not including the extra funds that will be added to it, which will be a large chunk of change over a 20 year period. That's brilliant, but then how is that deployed effectively and wisely?\nI was heartened by your responses to my last article and thank you enormously for the input - it's highly valued and appreciated, continuing to shape and inform my thinking. I think the few that I have pulled out express the different sentiments that everyone who commented conveyed and it’s galvanising to know that there’s alignment and resonance in some of the thoughts one has cultivated. Perhaps, together, there are changes that can be made.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_are-we-approaching-ai-in-the-city-thoughtfully/content_28.html": "19 July 2023\nAre we approaching AI in the City thoughtfully?\nAI promises so much to The City and the UK – new jobs, new opportunities, new growth - all things we need and want to encourage, but we need to remember that in amongst it all, we are still human.\n\"Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.\" Some might remember the immortal lines of Daphne Oxenford on Listen to Mother, inviting the under-fives to sit calmly and listen to the story of the day.\nQuiet focus is an essential part of our existence - it's part of our cognitive development, our ability to focus, and our mental wellbeing. However, it’s not something we get a lot of in the modern world. The academic evidence is that we get an ever-decreasing amount of uninterrupted concentration time thanks to all the emails, notifications and general volume of information around us, and the result is that we are also less capable of focusing.\nNot enough time to think\nIn his best-selling book, Stolen Focus, Why You Can't Pay Attention, Johann Hari writes that most of us don’t get a full hour to ourselves without being interrupted in the working day. He notes: \"This is happening at every level of business - the average CEO of a Fortune 500 company, for example, gets just 28 uninterrupted minutes a day.\"\nIt perhaps says something that I thought 28 minutes seemed like rather a lot of uninterrupted time. Hari continues to explore our collective reduction in concentration in his text, one element of which is linked to sheer overload. There's so much information going in from so many different angles, but despite the world's increased connectivity he notes that the human brain has not changed significantly in 40,000 years. The brain can only focus so much, so the more our attention is divided, the less we can concentrate on any one thing.\nThe belief is that this cumulative overload can result in everything from mental health problems to a lack of productivity and a lack of creativity because there simply isn’t space for it.\nThe dawn of a new era\nThat aspect of the modern human experience is interesting to consider alongside the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), which, while already present in our home and working lives, is on the precipice of something much bigger.\nLondon has set out to be a frontrunner in this space. Rishi Sunak only recently told technology leaders that he wanted Britain to be the dominant home of artificial intelligence, determined the UK will be “the best place in the world to start, grow and invest in tech businesses.” He has also urged caution, saying: “…I want to make the UK not just the intellectual home, but the geographical home of global AI safety regulation.”\nTogether these things beg us to take a moment, collectively and individually to consider the benefits and drawbacks of AI to make sure we’re using it thoughtfully and with intent.\nThe benefits of AI in the City of London\nAI is an exciting space, particularly in The City. It promises a range of enormous benefits, from minimising errors to streamlining processes, saving time and freeing up individuals to focus on more interesting tasks that involve higher-level executive function rather than repetition.\nA report this year named London a global leader in AI, and UCL wrote: \"The report, which ranked cities based on metrics such as total AI venture capital investment, the number of AI initiatives, and career and education opportunities, placed London at the top of the list, ahead of other major cities such as New York and Singapore.\"\nThere are lots of benefits to the inclusion of AI in financial services and other industries across the board - some more obvious than others. PwC predicts: \"UK GDP will be up to 10.3% higher in 2030 as a result of AI – the equivalent of an additional £232bn – making it one of the biggest commercial opportunities in today's fast-changing economy.\"\nThat alone is an incentive for both businesses and the British economy to welcome AI with open arms.\nWhat’s the ‘cost’ of AI?\nAs with most things, as well as benefits there are, not necessarily disadvantages to AI, but things that need thinking about in a calm moment of reflection. AI will inevitably add to, amend and change the way we live and work, possibly making it even more fast paced, and with those changes there comes a ‘cost’. The question, and possibly an unanswerable one at this point, is what is it?\nIt might be easiest to look at this in terms of the economic impact. A report by the Mental Health Foundation and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), said: \"mental health problems cost the UK economy at least £117.9 billion annually.\" That's the equivalent to around 5% of the UK’s GDP, and it was mostly linked to lost productivity.\nA report from the Mayor of London's office wrote: \"Mental ill health hampers London businesses each year by limiting employee productivity and reducing the potential workforce. £920 million alone is lost annually to sickness absences in the city, and a further £1.9 billion is lost to reduced productivity. The costs extend more widely, though, to amount to a staggering sum total of £10.4 billion lost each year to London business and industry.\"\nAs far as I can understand, the most common mental health problem amongst adults of working age in London (although many are believed to go unreported), are anxiety and depression. Equally, my belief, through a combination of research and anecdotal evidence is that information overload is a known cause of anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and mental fatigue.\nPsychology Today writes: \"It can also lead to cognitive issues such as difficulty making decisions or making hasty (often bad) decisions.\"\nManaging our approach for the best outcomes\nIt's difficult to gauge changes that AI will bring, but I think we must consider the long wave pattern in terms of its impact and how it works out.\nDo not misunderstand my thinking - I believe AI is a very exciting space for the UK. However, as with all wonderful things, it's the intention and purpose that has a profound effect on the outcome. We need to be conscious about what we're trying to achieve (and what we want to avoid), as we pursue this sophisticated form of technology. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t embrace it, but we should be cognisant of what the goal is, and importantly, consider the less tangible human impact so we can manage it best.\nAI promises so much to The City and the UK – new jobs, new opportunities, new growth - all things we need and want to encourage. We just need to remember that in amongst it all, we are human.\nImage: The image I have chosen to include here is of Antony Gormley’s Resolution, which sits on Shoe Lane. The artist has reportedly said: \"Seen from afar it looks like a man, from close up it looks like a city. It is wonderful to be able to site a work that interacts with the daily life of the street\" - which seemed apt for this topic.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_pages_ward-of-cheap/content_10.html": "The Ward of Cheap is a pivotal location within the City and I am constantly reminded both of its heritage and the contribution that each individual within it makes through their work and daily endeavours.\nAt the heart of it City, it contains within its boundaries some of the most iconic buildings in London - a small part of the Guildhall buildings (the main entrance and the main hall itself) and the approaches to Guildhall, two churches, the Corporation Church of St Lawrence Jewry and the Church of St Vedast alias Foster, and the Livery Halls of the Mercers, Goldsmiths, Wax Chandlers, and Saddlers Companies. Among its famous sons it numbers Thomas á Becket and Sir Thomas More, both of whom were born in the Ward.\nIt's an illustrious heritage to uphold, but the Ward continues to thrive and deliver ever greater contributions to our collective world.\nA personal connection with the Ward of Cheap\nI have long had an affiliation with the Ward of Cheap itself. I started work just off Cheapside, my Livery Company, the Haberdashers, has its roots in Gresham Street going back to 1458, and I am Patron of the Ward of Cheap Club.\nFollowing the combination of Rathbones and Investec Wealth & Investment UK this year, we will have our office here in the Ward at 30 Gresham Street. Therefore, it will be a particular pleasure to work and vote within the Ward I represent.\nThis part of the City is not just somewhere that I have a daily connection with, but so does my wife, Elspeth, who is a member of The Goldsmiths' Company, based in The Ward of Cheap.\nAll of this makes it a joy to serve as the Alderman of this particular Ward.\nThe history of the Ward of Cheap\nMindful that we are merely the custodians of the City for the time in which we are privileged to be here, I am always interested in the history of the area as part of an ongoing thread of continuity. The Ward of Cheap takes its name from the medieval market once held here, 'Cheap' being the old English word for 'market'. Although subjected to boundary changes over the centuries, throughout the City's history it has lain on the great East-West route connecting the Tower - a symbol of Royal power, with the Guildhall -the seat of civic government, as well as St Paul's Cathedral - the City's oldest place of worship.\nThe purpose of the City's Wards\nThe City's Wards were established in medieval times for the purpose of government, a role they continue to participate in today - instrumental to the governance of the City through the election of the City's Aldermen and Common Councillors.\nThere are 25 Wards, and each is represented on the Court of Aldermen and the Court of Common Council, by one Alderman and a number of Common Councillors (the number ranging between two and 10, depending on the size of the Ward).\nOne of the Common Councilmen will be designated as the Alderman's Deputy. Currently the Ward of Cheap is represented by three Common Councilmen, and candidates, men or women, must be Freemen of the City as well as on the electoral roll of the City of London.\nHow the Wards work\nWardmotes (meetings of the inhabitants of a ward) take place annually, in the second week of March, chaired by the relevant Alderman. Outside election years, voters meet their elected representatives to raise concerns and ask questions of them. The elected members also give an update to voters regarding the work they have undertaken during the previous 12 months, on issues affecting the City in general and the Ward in particular.\nAldermen and Common Councillors are elected by the electors of the Ward who are registered to vote on the Ward List. Registration occurs annually, when forms are sent to all residents and businesses in the Ward. Since 2013, elections for Common Councillors have been held every four years on either the third or fourth Wednesday in March, although in certain rare circumstances ordinary elections are instead held on another date to be determined by the Town Clerk in consultation with the Lord Mayor.\nThe recent Aldermanic election\nBy convention, Aldermen undertake to return to the electorate every six years. I won the election on 5th July 2018 in one of the most competitive elections, with seven candidates standing. I was honoured to be re-elected in early 2024 for a second term of six years.\nIf you would like to learn more about the City Wards and the organization and function of the City of London Corporation, you can visit their website at www.cityoflondon.gov.uk.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 index offers a slightly more domestic focus. Launched on 12th October 1992, it is the important indicator for those wanting to benchmark UK mid-cap equities. It is my experience that the companies quoted are amongst the most dynamic and exciting businesses within the stock exchange, and it is a great pleasure to have seen Rathbones be part of the FTSE 250 for many years.\nThe 30th anniversary of the FTSE 250 is an anniversary to commemorate, and so too of course, is Christmas. This is traditionally a time of hope - from a Christian tradition perspective we celebrate the birth of Jesus as Saviour of world, fundamentally the fulfilment of a promise and a message of hope. In the UK at least, the season is celebrated in winter when the days are dark, a reminder perhaps that it's always darkest before the dawn and we have the spring to look forward to.\nEconomic reasons to hope\nWith that in mind, I consider this. From a stock market perspective, we've been through a difficult time in the last few years. However, over the course of the FTSE 250 Index's history to date, its value is up by more than four times, plus the dividends that have been paid along the way. One hopes there will be more returns to come and that gifts will keep on giving as time goes on.\nIt is likely that economically things will remain challenging for the high street and household budgets for a while, but the Stock Exchange tends to look forward anywhere between six to 18 months, depending on how you value it. Despite the challenges for UK mid-caps, some have had good valuations. They are good businesses and there is plenty of reason believe they will prosper.\nAs we head towards the holidays, I wish you all peace, rest and reasons to look forward with hope. Merry Christmas.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_a-rich-tapestry-of-communities/content_23.html": "05 November 2018\nA Rich Tapestry of Communities\nThe City of London is a location and an environment that to many looks to be as impersonal as they come - filled with imposing office blocks and impenetrable reception desks backed up by security. But behind this façade, as I discovered on my route to becoming an Alderman of the City of London in July 2018, there is a rich tapestry of communities.\nThe City of London is a location and an environment that to many looks to be as impersonal as they come - filled with imposing office blocks and impenetrable reception desks backed up by security. But behind this façade, as I discovered on my route to becoming an Alderman of the City of London in July 2018, there is a rich tapestry of communities.\nBut what is a community? I would contend that community is not defined as living in proximity to another because after all one can live next to a neighbour, especially in a city block of flats, and never have met them. Instead it is living lives that are connected to others by a focus point or shared activity that allows generous and outwards facing relationships to be built.\nThe City of London has a fascinating mix of the old and the new. The world's oldest continuous municipal democracy, with origins that pre-date Parliament, is the City of London Corporation. Twice a year at Common Hall this body brings together the ancient Livery Companies, which are communities that have their roots as trade groups, often with a patron saint and prayer fraternity at their heart. These organisations have evolved over the centuries and whilst some - Goldsmiths, for example - still have their historic trade at the heart of what they do today, many have evolved into charitable bodies that support good causes. Haberdashers, for example, educate some 12,000 students across the state and private sectors. The creation of community in these organisations is further aided because members will usually be members for life, which I recall being very significant for me when I joined the Haberdashers' Company because it put the relationships with other members on a very different basis knowing that I would be seeing them for the next 50 years - God willing! New Liveries and Guilds continue to be formed today: most recently the Guild of Investment Managers that is open to new members.\nBut of course, the City has many shiny new office blocks with state of the art technology that allow it to compete as one of the world's leading financial and professional services centres, and this brings stresses and strains on relationships that could tend towards community. However, where an act of generosity is introduced, a collective spirit starts to build that can help develop community.September saw City Giving Day and as an Alderman I visited the banking group Investec which had arranged an impressive series of staff activities, including a wide range of fund raising initiatives and projects nearby.In seeing this in action, it was clear that community was being built in the office and locally through shared, generous outwards facing activity.\nThis reminded me that if we look back into the history of this country the provision of education and hospitals was provided by local communities, usually deriving from churches and religious communities, and many that exist today trace the roots back to this heritage. Indeed, a central tenet of our Judeo-Christian heritage as a nation is caring for those around you, which is also recognised in the Golden Rule of doing to others what you would have done to you. Of course, the parable of the Good Samaritan looms large in our minds when we think of this - one of the Lord Mayor's Appeal's designated charities is the Samaritans that ministers to those needing to talk, often due to feeling isolated and lacking community support.\nOne of the challenges that life in a big complex world provides is how and where to find and be community, because local groups can provide a sense of empowerment and belonging by contributing positively to their community. Indeed, some may argue that allocation of scarce resources can be done most effectively with community responsibility at the point of delivery, which begs the question whether the provision of state based services has been the cause of the cause local community erosion that seems to have been occurred in much of modern Britain. The unsustainable growth of public debt over the last decade suggests another, local community based way, may be required to address society's needs.\nSo, as I look out across the City I see many workplaces, ancient institutions and churches that are willing to help others, to serve, and in so doing bring a richness and security to our own lives and the lives of others. These are the characteristics of community. I am reminded of a former vicar at a church I used to attend saying people come to church for all sorts of reasons but stay because of friendships within the community. The world is not perfect, least of all the City of London, but there is hope when we come together in community - after all some may describe the Holy Trinity as a community\nThe above article was originally posted on the St Paul's Institute website on 5 Nov 2018",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_patronal-service-of-st-vedast-alias-foster/content_53.html": "06 February 2022\nPatronal Service of St Vedast-alias-Foster\nAlderman Robert Hughes-Penney's Address at the Patronal Service of St Vedast on 7th February 2022\nThis evening we gather for the Patronal service of St Vedast, the saint after whom this wonderful church is named.\nSt Vedast’s Feastday is 6th February and he was born in 453 AD and died 87 years later in 540 AD. He was the Bishop of Arras in Northern Gaul. He is remembered for his charity, meekness and patience.\nAnd significantly for us today his story is one of restoration. He helped restore the faith of his people, the community and Christian churches in the region after decades of destruction by invading tribes led by Atilla that had resulted in a return to paganism in the region.\nHis is a story and message of restoration – which is also the message of the whole Bible, true today as it was 1500 years ago in St Vedast’s when he lived it out. It is Jesus’s message to each of us personally and as a community and a City. The message of restoration gives us spiritual hope and it also gives us hope for a future beyond covid.\nThis building too, in which we sit this evening has its own story of restoration. First constructed in the 12th or 13th Century, it is thought to have been restored in the 16th Century and was described in 1603 by Stow in his Survey of London as “a fair church, lately rebuilt”. Later, following the great Fire of London there was another restoration and the most recent restoration took place in the early 1950s following the Blitz, which included a generous donation of gold leaf and aluminium for the ceiling from the Goldsmiths’ Co.\nSo, in much the same way as the wonders of creation speak of God’s glory the stories of restoration embodied in this building remind us of that verse from Paul’s 2nd letter to the Corinthians where it says in chapter 5 verse 17 “if anyone is in Christ they are a new creation, the old has passed away and the new has come!”\nThe Lectionary readings for today speak clearly to this message of restoration, don’t they?\nThe Valley of dry bones passage from the Prophet Ezekiel is profound and vivid in its imagery.\nIt’s often tempting to dismiss the OT as myth or fairy tale, but the book of Ezekiel is anything but, it contains more dates than any other OT prophetic book. Its prophecies can be dated with considerable precision – where previous generations might have been prepared to accept the Word handed down from previous generations the post-Enlightenment scepticism of recent generations demanding scientific proof has challenged this. But modern scholarship aided by scientific computer analysis of the archaeological records, cuneiform tablets and astronomy actually confirms the prophecies.\nEzekiel lived during a time of international upheaval; the Assyrian empire that had once conquered the Syro-Palestine area and destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel began to crumble under the blows of resurgent Babylon, with the great city of Ninevah falling in 612bc. The Egyptian Pharoah Neco II advanced to reassert their historic influence over the region three years later only to be overwhelmed by the Babylonians in 605 and Nebuchadnezzar was elevated to the Babylonian throne and went on to subdue Jerusalem in 597bc. Ezekiel was exiled to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 and when there emerged as a prophet – a distinguished man of great intellect and knowledge, not only in his own national traditions but also international affairs, history and culture. Following the fall of Jerusalem Ezekiel’s message turned to the Lord’s consoling hope for his people that they would experience restoration\nEzekiel here receives and prophecies a message of hope, of the body being reformed, restored and made whole where previously there was judgement and destruction. This too is an echo of the Gospel message of the whole Bible story; being under judgement in the law of the OT and that being superseded by the hope we have as believers in Jesus Christ, of forgiveness, restoration and eternal life.\nIf you are anything like me, and sometimes I need to be told things more than once, especially if its instructions from my lovely wife, Elspeth, God reminds us in the NT passage from 1 Corinthians that there wasn’t just one resurrection appearance, but six listed in this passage alone – that’s a message, in capitals, in bold and highlighted. And then there are many more reports of resurrection appearances in the Gospels.\nResurrection is the ultimate story of regeneration and restoration isn’t it. Regeneration is defined by the theologian Wayne Grudem “as the act of God awakening spiritual life in us, bringing us from spiritual death to spiritual life that gives us the spiritual ability to respond to God in faith.”\nThe last two years have been tough haven’t they; many of us will have had covid, all of us will have known friends and family who have had covid, and some of us will have suffered the pain of loss of loved ones. When you stop and think about it our lives have been stripped back to the bone; through lockdown all our usual relationships, contacts and activities were removed. Our workplaces were hollowed out, with only skeleton staff. I remember in October 2020 standing at the end of Cheapside just here, at lunchtime, looking towards the Bank with not a soul in sight; a modern image of the valley of dry bones.\nIt has not been easy though has it. In addition to the physical and financial toll of the pandemic we are also conscious of the toll on mental health. I like many others, and maybe you also, have at times struggled with the isolation. The reality is we need each other. At the very beginning of time, in Genesis, God says it is not good to be alone; God made us as social beings. Community, relationship is central to what we are. It is lovely to be here again, to be united with friends and neighbours. That is what God made us to be.\nHe, Almighty God, also cares for each one of us, and he is there for each of us, even in the darkest of times, even when we feel most alone and perhaps even have no sense of Him. That is what the poem Footprints that we heard also illustrates so vividly; He says to us “My precious child, I love you…when you only saw one set of footprints…that is when I carried you”. The prophet Ezekiel saying in v 3 “Sovereign Lord, you alone know”.\nAnd so as we begin to emerge from the pandemic let us thank God that we are now beginning to see some recovery, regeneration and restoration of society and the community, particularly in this church community, the Ward of Cheap and the City of London. Let us encourage one another as the Bible says, and as we have this evening, with words, deeds and spiritual psalms.\nAnd as we step into this new chapter let us also recognise that restoration, or re-creation, is like creation itself; a two-step process; first we were formed from the dust and then secondly, we received the breath of life. In Ezekiel this is echoed, first “hear the word of the Lord” and then “I will cause breath and spirit to enter you”. In the City, first lockdown is ended and secondly, we return. In our own lives and hearts, Jesus the Son of God, came down to earth and then we believe.\nIf you believe in Jesus you may want to recognise in your heart the restoration that has occurred in you and if you do not yet believe in Jesus can I invite you to believe in Him and receive that restoration.\nThe Lord restores, redeems and renews. It was true 1500 years ago in St Vedast’s day and it is true now. Alleluia.\nAmen.",

Good afternoon!\nBy way of introduction, my name is Robert Hughes-Penney, and I am the Alderman for the Ward of Cheap, which doesn’t sound quite as cool and sexy as Rob Brant’s “Wolf Clan” introduction!\nIt has been a huge privilege to be with you today. As the Lord Mayor said this morning, to connect to prosper.\nI have a great personal affection for Canada and its people. I had an incredibly happy and fulfilling year working in Canada in my 20s. My father spent 30 years working for a Canadian business, and I have relatives in British Columbia. So, I have a lot to be grateful for when it comes to Canada.\nProfessionally, as an investment manager who started work just around the corner over 30 years ago, I have consistently and consciously been an investor in Canadian companies for many years and am reassured by the Canadian track record of resilience in times of economic stress - the only G-7 country to have avoided a crisis in the GFC and with a World Economic Forum’s ranking for banking stability being first among 140 countries.\nToday, we have had the opportunity to reflect on how this great track record could be improved even further and, importantly, for an even wider range of people. We have heard from some truly distinguished and expert speakers about investment opportunities in Canada’s energy, natural resources, and infrastructure sectors and the important role that meaningful partnership with indigenous peoples has in achieving sustainable growth.\nWe have also had the opportunity to be informed and to discuss and reflect on these things, and I hope that in a positive and constructive sense, our thinking has also been challenged, distilled and developed. These are key and hugely significant subjects, not just for Canada but for the worldwide community.\nCanada is a country blessed with substantial natural assets and a rich heritage that is admired and respected around the world. As such, it has an important part to play in the world. There is a real opportunity for the country to serve the wider world by leading and modelling the harnessing for the mutual benefit of natural assets, heritage and diverse communities. So, I am encouraged by today’s meeting and our conversations, and I hope you are, too.\nI have long believed and said on occasions such as this that capitalism, at its best, is about the flourishing of humanity in the round, not just piling up pound coins or dollar bills. It should and must present opportunities not only for financial returns but also investments that contribute to the well-being of all humanity… those nations, communities and peoples that have been on the land since time immemorial and those that have arrived more recently.\nHal reminded us this morning that everyone has the same coloured shadow. So, the inclusion of indigenous communities in investment and development discussions and decisions fulfils the legal obligations but, even more importantly, is the right thing to do and rightly honouring, and I regret that has not always been the case, despite the fact that honouring and inclusion makes good business sense; with collaboration and partnership that unlocks innovation and creates new opportunities.\nBusiness has an important role in reconciliation.\nNo single person or group has a monopoly on good ideas, wisdom and insight. I believe we all have unique gifts and talents, which, when combined harmoniously, result in a better outcome for all.\nWe were reminded of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, and this reminded me of the Impact Investing Institute, of which I am on the Board, publishing its guide for engaging communities in place-based impact investing. And very much resonating with the theme of today’s conference was the reference in it to The International Association for Public Participation’s Spectrum of Public Participation, which is a recognised taxonomy for possible types of engagement. This sees an increasing impact on the decision when you go through five steps of: inform, consult, evolve, collaborate, and empower.\nOf course, this process allows the wisdom of the ages to emerge, and when it comes to providing valuable insights for sustainable development that can enhance pioneering solutions in managing natural resources, I am sure that indigenous knowledge and stewardship practices have much to offer.\nIndeed, I am often reminded when standing just outside at Bank junction, with many roads leading off it, here in the heart of the City, of another ancient prophet’s wise words; “stand at the crossroads and look, ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it.”\nAnd I think we’ve heard from all parties today a real desire and willingness to move forward in this spirit with those five steps of inform, consult, evolve, collaborate, and empower.\nAnd so, as we wrap up this afternoon, can I once again say how pleased we are to have had the opportunity to host you here in the Square Mile, the world’s most open and global financial centre. Our offer is to share the best of the rich ecosystem of financial and professional services that exist here, to support the indigenous investment initiatives and opportunities in Canada that will bring mutual benefit for parties across Canada and on both sides of the Atlantic.\nOf course, none of this would have been possible without the organisers, the speakers, the sponsors, the Lord Mayor and all the staff at Mansion House. So, we owe a debt of gratitude to the co-hosts Mark Magnacca of gigCMO and Rob Brant of McCarthy Tetrault, the sponsors, CIBC, Anglo American, Scotiabank and Enbridge, to all those that have contributed, to the Chiefs in particular for travelling to the City – your presence here today has been very special and we are humbled that you have taken the time to do this, and finally to all of you for coming.\nLet’s show our appreciation in a time-honoured way.\nThank you, and good afternoon.",

So, it will be a particular pleasure to work and vote within the Ward where I represent the interests of local businesses and individuals.\nTogether we will have one of the largest regional office footprints, with 23 locations in the UK and Channel Islands, and going forward they will be referred to as Rathbones Group Plc. This combination is not only positive news for Rathbones and Investec, but for the City and the nationwide financial ecosystem that we're a part of.\nServing the nation\nI have written before about what I believe to be the importance of the financial services sector in London for the local community and the nation as a whole.\nWe can consider this in terms of raw numbers as well as on a more holistic level. For example, it's widely reported that the City of London’s tax contribution (£1.2bn in business rates) represents 5% of England’s total business rates collection and is spent on services across the UK.\nLondon also accounts for almost a quarter (22.7%) of the UK's total economic activity, according to the Office of National Statistics. While I am a strong advocate for being physically present in the workplace, the flexibility of hybrid working enables people to live and work across the UK whilst drawing financial benefits from London through salaries as well as the power of personal investment choices.\nIn this way, there is an opportunity for The City to act like a battery pack for the country. We can help drive growth to all corners of the UK, further enabling individuals to live/visit and spend in local communities, feeding regional economies and the nation's collective success as well.\nServing individuals\nAs someone who works in the investment and wealth management sector, I think it's an incredible thing to consider the ecosystem we're a part of and what a personal impact financial services can have on people up and down the country as they to boost the financial wellbeing of themselves and their families.\nIt's easy to see the big towers of London and think of it purely as a set of impersonal financial deals, but every day I seek to remember that for each transaction or communication I am part of, there is an individual at the other end of that trade or action for whom it is deeply important. Perhaps it is helping them to save for a well-earned holiday, for their retirement, a new car or to buy their first home. It may simply be to create a little more security for their loved ones in an uncertain world.\nIt's to these people we owe it to be passionate as well as prudent in our endeavours within the City, taking our fiduciary responsibility seriously because others trust us to do so. It's the reason I implemented Rathbones Governance Committee to develop our proxy voting systems some 15 years ago. It is also why I am an advocate of the growing movement in the marketplace that believes shareholder voices should be heard as in the company.\nAs a case in point, last year Sir Douglas Flint’s Digitisation Taskforce was launched to drive forward the modernisation of the UK’s shareholding framework. Part of that involves the dematerialisation of share certificates, for the ultimate beneficial owners to be identified and for intermediaries (stockbrokers, nominee companies, fund managers) to offer access to shareholder rights for voting and so forth.\nNo man (or business) is an island\nWith all of this in mind, while the City is indeed a centre of commerce and trade, it’s much more than that as well. Our successes do not exist in a vacuum, nor are they merely our own. It's helpful to remember that the triumphs (and failures) of an organisation or individual are not theirs alone. They aren't purely the result of one person's hard work, and their impact is not isolated either.\nI think if we keep in mind the vast amount of work that's gone before us and exists around us; if we remember with compassion and humility that we are the privileged guardians of institutions; and that it's in our efforts that many individuals unknown to us put their faith and trust, then we also remember that there's purpose to our work that goes far beyond the daily ritual of coming to an office. It’s by doing our job well that we serve one another and the nation.",

A crucial part of the role is also to look after the welfare of the Judges at the Central Criminal Court (Old Bailey) within the City and make sure that the courts' business runs smoothly. It's an office that dates back to the seventh century, marking it out as the oldest in the City of London, and a great privilege to hold.\nRead more about the role of the Sheriffs\nJustice for all\nDuring this time, I have been reflecting on my own areas of focus, and believe the importance of justice is a prudent theme, as a core value within our society. After all, the two Sheriffs of London spend their elected year living and working at the Old Bailey, the UK's central criminal court, crowned by a glittering figure of Justice.\nAs it happens, 2025 also marks the 800th anniversary of the sealing of the 1225 version of Magna Carta, which enshrined the principle that no one, not even the monarch and their government is above the law.\nWhilst I am a fund manager rather than a lawyer, the law is a profession I have spent my life living adjacent to. My wife, Elspeth, is a lawyer, as is my sister and my cousin. The confines of the law, also, naturally work in tandem with delivering the best of all City business, not to mention the wider society of which we are all members.\nRecent events, as well as my nomination have found me ruminating on what justice actually means to us as a community. The phrase \"justice for all\" has been employed across the centuries, entreating us to be our best and do our best by one another. It's as much an entreaty to the authorities as to individuals, to remember their duty to society. When we break it down, I believe that both practically and ideologically its meaning can be best addressed in three parts:\n- Justice for the accused\n- Justice for survivors\n- Justice for prison leavers\nA City of justice\nI don't raise these topics to suggest that the City can solve them all, but I do believe that if we all do something then a lot can be achieved, and the City and its community are in a powerful collective position to raise awareness and drive change.\nPhilosophically, I believe in mercy and grace. Society and humanity need that to live a healthy life, otherwise we're constantly aggrieved. Flowing out of that you get forgiveness and redemption, and hopefully you also get more kindness, understanding and better outcomes.\nIn financial services we understand redemption in terms of bonds - when the term is served and the principal repaid, it matures and moves on - hopefully, having become richer in the process. Broadly speaking, it's a principle that works, perhaps it has greater application?",

  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_the-power-of-an-international-perspective/content_6.html": "28 November 2023\nThe power of an international perspective\nThe City of London is part of a global community, and while its societal function is primarily focused on fiscal responsibility and betterment, the impact of doing that well is wide reaching. In the pursuit of a better world, the City has a profound role to play. Here are my thoughts.\nThe newly elected Lord Mayor, Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli, is championing his initiative, ‘Connect to Prosper’, emphasising the City's unique role as a global knowledge connector and talent cluster, as well as showcasing its capacity to address global challenges and foster inventiveness through its communities.\nHe says, eloquently: “My Connect to Prosper theme will bring together thought leaders from the business, scientific, and academic worlds to demonstrate the City’s strengths in solving global challenges. Together we will showcase the Square Mile’s unique leadership role as the world’s coffeehouse, where connections between firms, institutions, and people, lead to new ideas and solutions that benefit the world.”\nIt’s a sentiment I strongly connect with, offering a modern take on the heritage of our great trading nation. That heritage was famously founded on the Stock Exchange, which started life in The City’s coffee shops, while the likes of Lloyd's began at a coffee house on Tower Street in 1686. It's the connectivity that the City brings, both within the Square Mile itself and as part of the global community, that gives it a unique ability to bring people together and forge prosperous relationships.\nOur collective strength\nLondon's reputation as the world's coffee house is something that I have always felt very deeply connected to. My personal and professional lives have always been inextricably international, having been born in Brazil, spent time in Latin America, enjoyed my childhood in South Africa, and having lived and worked in Canada and Germany as well as the UK. A passion for exploring, understanding and being part of the wider world is something that my children also share - one of my sons graduated in Chinese Studies, spending time in China, where my wife's family have links as well - clearly, it's in the genes.\nWhile we perhaps don't think about it as often as we might, the UK has its strength in being a nation of immigrants. The Celts, the Romans, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes - across the centuries so many have come and continue to come to our little island, adding to the culture, the ideas, the talent and the collective perspective - a strength that only becomes more relevant in an ever more intertwined global community. Professionally, I have always found an international perspective to be beneficial - as global investor I have spent 30 years looking at opportunities around the world and facilitating the City's role within them. Personally, I think having the understanding of different viewpoints adds nothing but value to any circumstance – we are, after all, in this together.\nMaking an impact\nThere is no doubt that right now there is a huge amount of turbulence in the world. We have seen the devastating events in Ukraine over the past couple of years, for which I organised the Pray for Ukraine event at Holy Sepulchre Church, Holborn Viaduct as part of last year’s Global Day of Prayer, the City of London Prayer Breakfast in association with the Square Mile Churches. There have also been environmental disasters, and of course, more recently, the violence in Israel and Gaza. Having been to Israel and Palestine earlier this year, it seems unfathomable.\nNaturally, these events not only have a human impact but an impact on our financial stability as a global community as well. I have written before about how I think trade is the first line of defence, but equally economic stability is a fundamental humanitarian provision as well. Herein, the City, which has a profound impact on the economy in London, the UK and the world around us, has a role to play.\nI recently spent some time at The Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC) conference with Baroness Helena Morrissey and Sir Paul Marshall. While my views are more centrist than some of those articulated, their overarching goal is one I fundamentally agree with – we must strive to be an international community with a vision for a better world, and we must look to both business and politics to lead that discussion.\nI hope this is something I contribute to in my position as Alderman of the Ward of Cheap. It’s a role that gives me a deeply felt opportunity to bring together my personal and professional experience in a way that contributes to the wellbeing of those within the City of London and all those connected to it, in the constant pursuit of a better future.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_supercharging-the-uk-s-communities/content_65.html": "30 November 2021\nSupercharging the UK’s communities\nLevelling up isn't just about government supporting community - it comes from community as well, with each individual, business, and organisation doing its bit where it can.\n“The ‘levelling up’ of England’s regions is long overdue” heralded Michael Heseltine in a recent article for the Financial Times.\nI think many of us would agree with the former Conservative deputy prime minister and environment secretary, along with his assertion that ‘levelling up’ needs to be much more than a PR-able headline for the government plans, which are: “committed to levelling up across the whole of the United Kingdom to ensure that no community is left behind, particularly as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.”\nIn addition to a number of funding initiatives, the agenda seeks to:\n“involve the UK government decentralising power and working more directly with local partners and communities across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, who are best placed to understand the needs of their local areas and more closely aligned to the local economic geographies to deliver quickly on the ground.”\nWhile we await Michael Gove’s planned white paper on the matter, the information so far has echoes of David Cameron’s Big Society. In 2010 he announced in a speech in Liverpool that the Big Society was about a culture change where people:\n“…don’t always turn to officials, local authorities or central government for answers to the problems they face …but instead feel both free and powerful enough to help themselves and their own communities.”\nFor whatever reason, Cameron’s idea didn’t quite seem to capture the mood of the moment - perhaps it was ahead of its time or maybe it wasn’t communicated in a way that resonated.\nEven so, during the pandemic we have seen enormous power in the concept of loving thy neighbour and doing as you would be done by. We have seen neighbours who had never spoken to one another before helping with food shops, and in March 2020 it was reported that more than 1,000 volunteer groups had been set up to help those self-isolating during the coronavirus outbreak.\nNow, we can look back and take from/build on the Big Society concept, both in government and in business, to leverage and support the real strength in communities, including the City of London. The government’s policy should be the catalyst for that.\nA collective effort\nOf course, levelling up is not just about supporting community - it comes from community as well, with each individual, business, and organisation doing its bit where it can. Heseltine wrote:\n“East London, Merseyside and the Hulme estate in Manchester are glittering examples: with the promise of public investment, the private sector, inward investors, universities, charities and others added their capital budgets to those of the taxpayer.”\nAs an alumnus of Manchester Metropolitan University, I remain connected with the institution, which is very much a leader in this regard. A large university, it has one of the biggest domestic student bodies (around 38,000) in the country and a higher than average proportion from less privileged backgrounds. The scale of the University allows their significant efforts to support students with barriers to university, to have a profound impact on individuals, but also on community as a whole, something that will become apparent as those students filter into the working world and chart their own paths.\nCurrently, their headline statistics show:\n- 40% of their UK undergraduates come from a household income of less than £25k\n- Over 1/3 identify as having black, Asian or ethnic minority background\n- 50% of their UK undergraduate students are the first in their family to go to university\nWhy is it important to expand opportunities to university? Looking at income alone, figures from 2018 show that working-age graduates earned around £10,000 more than non-graduates and that they had higher employment rates.\nDominic Boyd, Director of Development and Alumni Relations and Megan Hubbard, Head of Widening Participation, and their respective teams, lead the way on initiatives that find students who have barriers to entry, and support them through university and into the working environment with a view to individual long-term success. They don’t just seek to get students into uni, but also to make sure they don’t drop out of university, either because of financial pressures, mental health or a lack of mentoring and support.\nFor example, their award-winning First Generation Scholarship Programme identifies students across the North West who would be the first in their families to go to university. It is funded by the university as well as donors. Many of these donors are alumni of the University but others are philanthropists and organisations that share a commitment to social mobility. Several corporate donors have also funded scholarships at the University to improve representation in sectors that historically lack diversity. Sony, for example, has funded scholarships in digital and the creative arts, and Formula 1 supports a scholarship in engineering. The University has proactively solicited those relationships.\nThe information superhighway\nBack in The City, the 2021/2022 Mayoral Theme has been described as People & Purpose:\n“It will champion a purpose led and people focused UK FPS sector; growing the global competitiveness of the UK as a world leader in ESG and sustainable finance and home to the best and most diverse global talent; driving social mobility at all levels.”\nIts agenda is aligned with wanting to turn the government’s levelling up agenda into reality, incorporating investment and the power of The City to look after and look out for people both in the form of social returns and total returns. With that in mind, it seems that The City has more of a role to play across the UK than ever and in part that may come from the innovation we have seen resulting from Covid-19.\nWhen it comes to levelling up, some of the debate is around literal access. It is said that times of ‘war’ (which Covid could be described as) are often the times of innovation and advancement - necessity being the mother of invention. Back in spring 2020 many said we had leapt forward 10 years in technological advancement in 10 weeks. With that comes an opportunity for The City to be more plugged in than it has in the past.\nThe advancement of technology creates the superhighways that connect us. Before, you might have access to the captains of industry only if you met them in person - now they are more widely available online. In education too, there are growing number of providers, Gresham College in The City and a host of other institutes, are making knowledge more publicly and freely available. The access to information, knowledge, and individuals is greater than any other time.\nA battery pack for the UK\nThere is also the ongoing debate around remote working/home working, its relevance. To some extent this will be a work in progress, collectively and for individual organisations. It’s inevitable that we will all need to find varying degrees to which it works for us and our companies. In addition, as technology advances at an ever-increasing rate, it will continue to expand the opportunities in terms of where we physically work and how.\nI am an ardent advocate of being physically present in The City for a variety of reasons. I have mentioned before, its importance for training the next generation of professionals in particular. However, remote working doesn’t reduce the relevance of the City of London either, if anything it only increases its importance, and its possibilities for the future, adding another dimension to its role.\nLondon accounts for almost a quarter (22.7%) of the UK's total economic activity, according to the Office of National Statistics. It has long been an issue whereby the majority of UK wealth and income opportunities centres on a few urban areas, but that the cost of living in or near those areas, and commuting, is prohibitive to many. There is also a significant average wage gap between London and other parts of the UK.\nWith many enjoying a newfound appreciation for a greater work/life balance and countryside living, is there an opportunity for The City to act like a battery pack for the country? To be even more of an enabler for other parts of the UK, where people can earn from London, live across the UK, and spend more locally and feeding local economies in turn? Perhaps it has the capacity to wire the rest of the country into the power of The City in the kind of step change that hasn’t occurred since the railways were introduced.\nThe concept of levelling up is certainly not new, and creating seismic change is never something that can happen overnight, but it does seem that for all the dreadful things of the last couple of years, perhaps we are able to evaluate our circumstances, tools and plans with a fresh perspective. The opportunities are emerging, and without wishing to resort to too many catchphrases, perhaps while we’re focusing on making the tides rise, we can also ensure it lifts all boats.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_charity-philanthropy-colloquy-tuesday-24th-september/content_38.html": "24 September 2024\nCharity & Philanthropy Colloquy – Tuesday 24th September\nI was honoured to represent the Lord Mayor at the Charity & Philanthropy Colloquy at Mansion House. This event brought together experts and key figures to explore transformative philanthropy and new approaches to modern charity. As part of Alderman Michael Mainelli's 'Connect to Prosper' theme, we engaged in thought-provoking discussions aimed at advancing charitable efforts.\nSheriff-elect, distinguished panellists, honoured guests, ladies & gentlemen, good morning!\nAnd a warm welcome to Mansion House for the Charity & Philanthropy colloquy.\nMy name is Robert Hughes-Penney, and it is my great pleasure and privilege to be the Lord Mayor’s Aldermanic Representative this morning, to welcome you here on his behalf and to make a few opening remarks.\nAs you may be aware, the Lord Mayor, Alderman Michael Mainelli's theme this year is Connect to Prosper, and as part of that, he has arranged a series of coffee colloquies, connecting people in the age-old London coffee house style in order to share ideas, and ultimately to prosper and improve the common good. Each colloquy brings together several experts to speak on and discuss one of the UN Sustainable Goals.\nNow, the good news is that today is the special bonus edition, the double shot coffee or the free top-up, if you will, because charity & philanthropy isn't actually one of the SDGs, although you might well argue it should be. And so, in the spirit of charitable generosity and wisdom, the Lord Mayor has added this extra one.\nAnd you will, of course, notice that, very appropriately, it is being held on City Giving Day – running since 2015 and having raised over £3.5m. This is the day in the year which enables over 600 businesses and employees to come together to celebrate and showcase their charitable and volunteering achievements. Wonderfully, 73% of organisations involved reported that the day inspired their employees to become more involved in charitable activity. To mark the occasion, we, by tradition, wear something red and add the hashtag GoRed to our posts.\nBut besides the fun of City Giving day, this is also a subject that interests me enormously; I have served on the board of several charities, from very large to very small, and from grant-making to fundraising. Each was doing its own wonderful and inspiring work.\nProfessionally, as an investment manager, I have also sat on the other side of the table and managed, and still do, Portfolios for a range of charities. And, of course, while we like to be able to report excellent risk-adjusted returns, it actually also gives me great pleasure to hear from the trustees to whom I am reporting some of the great work that the charities are doing, delivering hope and healing in their respective contexts; it brings the important human story into what might otherwise just be numbers and percentages. In that way it makes sense of what I am doing.\nAnd that brings us to today’s focus of transformative philanthropy – how do we best deliver philanthropy on the front line? If we open our eyes, we see need all around us; in no particular order and not a complete list, there are as many charitable sectors as letters of the alphabet: from animals to children, education and environment, homelessness and health to medical and overseas aid. And the list goes on.\nBut today, we will be considering, with the help of our expert panellists, led by the City University Centre for Charity Effectiveness, in partnership with the Pan Livery Pro-bono group, The Beacon Collaborative and the Better Society Capital, new ideas, innovative ideas that have the potential to move the field of charity and philanthropy forward. And I would encourage all, in that spirit of connecting to prosper, to inspire and encourage one another.\nAnd in that vein, may I conclude by reflecting that last week I had the privilege of visiting Assisi, in Italy, home of St Francis, who was the son of a wealthy merchant who gave up all his material possessions, distributing them liberally to the poor and disadvantaged. This challenged me in a number of ways, but let me share just two with you; first, there was the reminder that the act of giving is good for the giver, not just the recipient. It softens the givers' hearts and creates healthy bonds in society and community. Someone once said there’s a route when creating the charitable runway of converting the head, then the heart and then the wallet. Secondly, there was the model of Francis giving directly from his resources into the hands of the poor and how this contrasts with the business of charity, or charity businesses. I wonder how best we square that circle.\nSo let's enjoy this morning. After all, someone once said that God loves a cheerful giver, so let's be encouraged and inspired in our own and our mutual endeavours.\nThank you, and have a good morning.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_empowering-the-individual-remembering-that-work-and-community-are-about-people/content_52.html": "07 June 2023\nEmpowering the individual: remembering that work and community are about people\nLast month I wrote about the value of shared wisdom and community within the City and beyond. Whilst such philosophical reflections are interesting, there is a point at which one asks - how does this all relate to our daily experiences and tangible goals?\nLast month I wrote about the value of shared wisdom when it comes to both our individual experiences of work and life, as well as our shared community within the City and beyond. Whilst such philosophical reflections are interesting it's important, especially for a world leading financial and professional services city like London, to translate that thinking into practicalities and practical action. So, there is a point at which one asks - how does this all relate to our daily experiences and tangible goals?\nHybrid working is just part of a work in progress\nWe see questions around community play out, in the City, in the context of our working environments. Since the pandemic, businesses have been faced with both the challenge and the opportunity of reconsidering their approach to the office.\nMost companies are still finding their way when it comes to hybrid working - who, what, when and how should people come into the office? Do they want to? When do they need to? What does that mean for the literal structure of an office and its purpose? How does that affect company culture? What are the pros and cons for physical and mental health? What does it mean for urban communities? The reality, I suspect, is that all of this will continually evolve.\nWhen speaking to individuals who design office spaces, the nature of them is that where once upon a time you might have had rows of desks with people huddled over their computers, today much of that independent work is perhaps done from home. The office, in many circumstances, serves more as a space for collaboration, communication, creativity and learning. We see more communal spaces and smaller meeting rooms for interviews or Zoom calls.\nThere is a lot of hypothesising about the science behind workspaces and how we work - broadly speaking, people seem to be in three camps:\n- Those who firmly believe in people coming into the office\n- Those who are ardent advocates of home working\n- Those who think that a balance between the two is best\nNo doubt it's dependent on the business, the job role, and the individual themselves.\nOur responsibility to one another\nI think perhaps much comes down to autonomy - trusting and empowering individuals to make independent and appropriate choices about the way they work.\nWe know more about neurodiversity now than ever and are more compassionate in today's world about the needs of individuals. As employers we need to recognise that we are not parents - we must understand that some people really cannot work well in an open plan space with a lot of noise, but also that not everyone has a suitable space at home to work in either. That might be because they live in shared housing, have difficult home lives or simply don't have the space to set up a home office. Then again, some people thrive in, and need, the stimulus of a working environment both to work at their best and for their mental well-being.\nEqually, individuals need to be honest with themselves about what they need to deliver their best at work and to contribute for the mutual benefit of themselves, their colleagues, and their employer. It is a function of mutual responsibility, perhaps with no singular answer.\nFor my own 10 pence worth, I think that people who want to do well at work will make decisions that enable them to do the best job they can. By harnessing that individual motivation, I think the City can do better than it already has done, contributing widely and creating greater successes beyond the Square Mile, as well as helping to address the major challenges of today – inflation, the cost of living, competing on the world stage, and attracting and retaining top talent.\nWe are human\nA point that shouldn't be forgotten is that we are fundamentally social beings. As Covid recedes in our memories there’s an increasing realisation that in a commercial environment we need to spend time with one another. Online meetings are good for occasional meetings with business providers, but when you’re in a team context you need to be closer together to keep ideas ticking over and for channels of communication to remain open, so that misunderstandings are minimised, learning is optimised, and experience is maximised.\nOn a personal note, I find that if I’m sitting next to someone, any misunderstandings in communication are quickly lanced and time together creates a healthier in team dynamic. I'm sure I’m not alone, and as a result I think we will continue to see the need for people to come back to work in the office more frequently.\nPrior to Covid we had half a million people coming into the City everyday to work and I theorised that taking a three-to-five-year view we would have considerably more people than that coming in everyday as a place to do business or work. They might not necessarily come in five days a week, nine to five, but people would be drawn to working hubs to engage personally. It now feels like those numbers are continuing to recover and could still end up in that place over the next few years, particularly with the evolution of a destination City concept that incorporates a more social and cultural hub as well. Indeed, if the recent report from the Centre for Cities is anything to go by “Policymakers should be wary that we don’t let a public health emergency turn into a longer-term negative impact on the economy” by overlooking more than a century’s worth of academic work demonstrating the economic benefits of face-to-face collaboration and agglomeration.\nThe best of all worlds\nPerhaps something of a channel for all this hypothesising, this year will see the launch of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC). It is being established as an international community with a vision for a better world, where every citizen is empowered to prosper, contribute and flourish. It seeks to foster a community of change makers, encouraging individuals to be responsible and proactive for themselves and the world about them - all of us ultimately working for the growth, prosperity and productivity of all.\nI am firmly of the belief, in part because I already see it in action, that both as individuals and as a community it is possible to be a simultaneously collaborative society and a community that encourages and rewards individual growth and success. With these aspects of the City aligned we can achieve more than the sum of our parts, taking the challenges and learnings of recent years as well as the advantages of past ways of working and new ones, to ultimately have and create the best of all worlds.",

In many ways I think this is where the City and its constituent businesses can make the most tangible difference. It's also an opportunity for companies to access talent that is often overlooked and under appreciated.\nIn the last few years there has been a lot of talk in businesses about diversity and inclusion, but how well those concepts translate into meaningful reality is perhaps a murkier subject. I think there can also be a lot of misconceptions when it comes to prison leavers, notably about what to expect both from the individuals and from their employers.\nFor my own part, in conversations with the likes of Kate Carr from the Fair Chance Business Alliance, I have found the statistics eye-opening and thought provoking. I have also had the privilege of meeting individuals who have lived experience of the justice system and become valuable members of the City's financial community. It would very much be our loss if they had not been given that chance.\nI hope that in sharing some of the things I have learned so far, you too will find some inspiration.\nWhat does someone with a conviction 'look' like?\nWorking in finance, I always find numbers a good place to start in terms of trying to understand the big picture. The overcrowding of our prisons has been much publicised over the last 12 months, not least with the government's early release scheme, which began in September.\nWhat I learned speaking to Kate at the Fair Chance Business Alliance however, is that a startling one in four working age adults has a criminal record in the UK. The vast majority of those have not been to prison, but that means that a quarter of adults are in a position where a DBS check might exclude them from getting a job or promotion.\nOther, fairly startling, statistics include:\n- 90% of people with a criminal record haven't been to prison. Therefore, the vast majority of people who are struggling to find work because of a criminal record most likely do not fit a dangerous stereotype.\n- Only a third of people serving a custodial sentence have been convicted of a violent offence.\n- 61% of criminal records are for motoring offences, which doesn't make them irrelevant to an employer, but doesn't necessarily mean that they will present a risk in every workplace.\n- A third of women with a criminal record have it for non-payment of their TV licence.\n- 79% of convictions handed down are fines.\nEven with that small window of context, it's clear that what a DBS check doesn't show, is anything that would help an employer to make an informed decision about whether or not recruiting someone with a criminal record poses a risk within their organisation. This is where more of us can do better.\nPainting a clearer picture through the Fair Chance Business Alliance\nKate is a font of all knowledge and a passionate advocate for creating a level playing field in employment for anyone with a criminal record. She is Head of Operations and Membership at the Fair Chance Business Alliance, a not-for-profit, employer funded and founded alliance of businesses that have come together to share best practice on recruiting and progressing people with criminal records. It's the first organisation of its kind, featuring a gold, silver, and bronze tiered charter on what employers need to do to bring in people with records safely and sustainably, making sure there aren't risks to the organisation or the individual.\nKate is dedicated to countering stereotypes, and part of that is painting a more multifaceted picture of who we're talking about. She says:\n\"Many employers are committed to improving diversity and inclusion, and will often target particular groups of talent, such as neurodiverse people, ethnic minorities, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Given that a quarter of people of working age has a criminal record, and all of those groups mentioned are overrepresented in the criminal justice sector, employers who automatically exclude a person with a criminal record are indirectly leaving behind a significant proportion of their target group. Furthermore, a DBS check provides very limited detail and no context at all about the circumstances surrounding the initial incident or the journey that a person has been on since their conviction. Part of improving opportunities involves getting to know the person in front of us - you can’t know a person just because they have a criminal record.\"\nKate notes that businesses talk a lot about social mobility and diversity. However, with many of the people in those categories also being overrepresented in the criminal justice system, businesses have to be open to addressing barriers to recruiting those with criminal records if they are genuine about their Corporate Social Responsibility agendas.\nShe also points out that if one in four people have a criminal record, then the odds are that almost every business already has employees with criminal records on staff (perhaps as much as 25%) - they simply don't know about it. That might have the compounding impact of preventing those individuals from progressing by applying for promotions or being fully confident in the workplace, for fear that their record might be uncovered. Kate highlights:\n\"Employers talk a lot about building inclusive cultures, but if a quarter of your employees feel they have to hide their past it’s unlikely that you have the open culture you think you do.\"\nA risk-based approach\nThe message from Kate and the Fair Chance Business Alliance is a clear one. She says:\n“Businesses should have a risk-based approach in place for both the organisation and each role they recruit for. You need to consider whether someone with a criminal record poses a risk, and whether all criminal records pose a risk or just some. Think about the role and about the person. It's fine to ask about a criminal record if the role requires, but do it in a way that allows for context - a DBS check doesn't give you that.”\nEver the pragmatist, Kate is also anxious that employers don’t think that they need huge and complicated programmes in place to bring those with a criminal record into the business. She says:\n“There are some organisations that do a huge amount, with incredible recruitment programmes, mentoring and support, especially for prison leavers. That’s fantastic if you have the resources, but I also want smaller firms to know that isn’t the only way. Driving systemic change can be much simpler than that. These are individuals, and like any other employee they have individual needs. So, my recommendation would be to approach people on their own merits.”\nHiding behind the regulator\nIt's understandable that many businesses get concerned about extra layers of risk, or perceived risk, within their organisations, but in many instances ensuring there are opportunities for people with criminal records is simply a matter of good due diligence. Of course, that takes time, and lots prefer to err on the side of caution. The numbers however, are such that burying our heads in the sand isn't a realistic or prudent option - we simply cannot overlook a talent pool the size of Greater London’s population (an MoJ extract of Police National Computer data recorded 9.4 million offenders of working age with a nominal record in August 2024).\nKate notes that lots of businesses, especially in finance opt to hide behind the regulator, but she patiently points out that applies in very few instances: \"To say that people with a criminal record pose too big a risk to a business because it's in financial services is short sighted. Some will be, but most will probably be able to have some position in your firm.\"\nShe encourages businesses to look at the guidelines laid out by the FCA and PRA, where in fact very few roles need to be approved in a world where there are thousands of jobs. Surely someone who didn't pay their TV licence 10 years ago deserves a fair chance? Over in the US, 10% of JP Morgan’s new hires now come from people with a criminal background, and the story is similar in regulated sectors.\nLargely, the regulator also leans towards encouraging businesses to take a risk-based approach, not automatically discounting anybody because they have a conviction and making sure they seek context in each individual case. Certainly it's not the position of regulators to automatically exclude a quarter of the population from the workplace.\nThe cost of crime in the UK\nI also think it's important to look at the cost of crime in the UK and where we can mitigate it. We all have differing opinions about justice and what it means, but by law if someone has paid their fine, served their sentence or satisfied a judgement then they have paid the price and done what's required of them in respect to their offence and philosophically one can say they are redeemed.\nIt's then incumbent on us as a society to make sure there are pathways for them to make a positive and constructive contribution. And the individual needs to engage positively and constructively with that opportunity for the improvement of social cohesion and strength, part of which is economic. That way, families will be better provided for, and the wider economy has an improved chance of thriving. Furthermore, when people feel they're doing well they're less likely to end up back in trouble.\nThe Times recently wrote about the cost of crime in the UK, saying: \"Research by the Policy Exchange think tank estimated that the tangible cost of crime in the UK was about £170 billion, or 6.5 percent of GDP. Of that, about £38 billion is inflicted on businesses, £31 billion on the public sector and £63 billion on individuals. It calculated that further costs, which include behavioural changes by businesses and individuals because of a heightened fear of crime, would take the overall impact of crime to £250 billion.\"\nWith that in mind, I think that it's also essential that we make sure prison leavers have the opportunity to embrace an optimistic future once they have served their sentence, fine, or other punitive consequence of their actions. Without that prospect we are most likely to perpetuate an increasingly high cost of crime going forward. As it stands, the overall proven reoffending rate in the UK has fluctuated between 23.1% and 31.8% in recent years, and we know that there's a lack of adequate and consistent support for prison leavers (reported by the National Audit Office), which exacerbates the problem.\nMy friend Paul Cowley MBE, has been instrumental in galvanising that thought process for me, and showing the profound importance of a job and job prospects following a prison sentence, in ways that many of us cannot imagine. Paul is Director of Rehabilitation at Iceland Foods, the UK’s largest employer of former prisoners. He has his own remarkable story, which takes him from a troubled upbringing to a prison sentence by the age of 17, before joining the army and eventually becoming a priest. Amongst his many standout achievements, he founded the charity Caring for Ex-Offenders (CFEO) in 2005, which has helped over 2000 men and women reintegrate back into society, and he was awarded an MBE from Her Majesty the Queen for Services to Ex-Offenders in 2016. He also enabled me to do my first prison visit around 30 years ago.\nIn a poignant post from 2023 on the social media platform X, he wrote: \"Spent the morning in HMP Styal met 4 women who want to work for Iceland foods, all three had dramatic stories - one of them only 20 brought up in an abusive divorced family said ‘prison is the safest place, I like it here’ we’re giving her hope a second chance with a job with us.\"\nThe cost of missing out on talent\nMy final thought for the day is on the cost of missing out on talent through a lack of opportunity, and this I believe to be immeasurable. The City is a global centre of excellence for many industries, but finance in particular. However, The Financial Services Skills Commission (FSSC) estimates that financial services has the second-largest skills gap of any UK sector.\nI believe that one of the best things about the City, and perhaps something that often gets lost, is that it has its proverbial doors wide open to anyone with talent, ambition, and aptitude, and that anyone with those attributes will be well received, able to contribute and succeed. It is an ideal illustrated by the story of Dick Whittington, and it is imperative that it remains a reality because those attributes are not two a penny.\nA shining example of someone whose skill we should all be the poorer without, is my friend Egerton. Now an executive at a leading financial institution, he served a five-year prison sentence from the age of 17, using that time to turn his life and his mindset around. His story is unquestionably inspirational - a young man who had the wherewithal to use his prison sentence as an opportunity to study, emerging in his mid-twenties and taking every chance he could to improve his life and that of those around him. He is now on a glowing path to success, in part because of an opportunity a mentor provided him with at a City start-up, and guidance from the esteemed Lord Michael Hastings.\nEgerton says: \"When I was away I took the time to develop myself and understand who I am. I tried to create a new sense of identity, and once that door opened in my mind I gravitated towards finance. I tried to treat it like a university degree. I was serving at least five years, so I thought 'what can you do with five years at this age? What are other people doing at my age?' They were studying. So, I thought I should do the same. I read every book I could on finance for three years, and when I came out of prison I was determined to test my knowledge and see if it was valid. I made a point of meeting people, and asking questions. Eventually one of the CEOs I met gave me an internship - he was an amazing guy and perhaps a bit of a maverick. From there I have been able to build my career.\"\nPrison leavers and perspective\nEgerton's story is a powerful example of someone having an opportunity for a fresh start and grasping it with both hands. It is wonderful to see him flourishing as an individual, but it also has to be noted that we all share in his success. The City must remember that alongside the ethical need to provide opportunities for prison leavers and those with criminal records, there's also a practical one. The economic cost of not providing those fresh chances is not something we can afford, but the opportunity to show compassion and understanding, and turn it into collective success, both materially and socially, is vast.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_installation-dinner-as-newly-elected-master/content_66.html": "16 July 2019\nInstallation Dinner As Newly Elected Master\nAcceptance Speech\nWardens, Immediate Past Master, Brother Alderman, fellow Investment Managers, honoured guests.\nIt gives me great pleasure to rise as the newly elected Master of the youngest, freshest, most dynamic, forward looking Guild in the City of London.\nThank-you Fyona for so generously introducing the new Master and Wardens and proposing the Toast. I think you may have flattered us with your kind words, or given that this is the Guild of Investment Managers I might more accurately describe it as a promotion – can I just check that you did get the promotion signed off by Aviva compliance before publishing it!\nAlso, I can’t help reflecting that we all know in this industry past performance is no guide to future returns – and what goes up can come down!\nFyona, let me just turn the tables for a moment, and say that I am sure we all recognise how much Fyona has done for the Guild over the last year or so, chairing the events committee, preparing and sending out newsletters, and being the driving force behind the website. So, as a small token of our appreciation and by way of thanks for all you’ve done may I invite you to come up and receive this token of our thanks.\nNow, like all of us that are members, I like you spend my days hunkered down behind a couple of screens and so my natural metier is not standing on occasions like this and speaking, so I hope you will bear with me.\nBy way of preparation I went to church the other day for inspiration and found myself asking God,\n\"How long is 10 million years to you?\"\nGod replied, \"1 second.\"\nSo, thinking quickly I asked God, \"God, how much is 10 million pounds to you?\"\nAnd God replied, \"A penny.\"\nHmm, interesting, thinking even quicker I asked God, \"God, can I\nhave one of your pennies?\"\nAnd God replied, \"Just wait a sec.\"\nNow you will appreciate the investment management industry is a very significant part of the UK economy - the UK with over £8tn of AUM is the largest centre of investment management outside US, accounting for 35% of all European AUM, and employs over 50,000 people nationwide. The UK is also rated the second global wealth management centre after Switzerland, and 10 of the 20 largest global sovereign wealth funds have offices here in London. Interestingly the industry has also been growing at a faster pace here in London than globally. Companies represented here tonight include...\nNow I’m sure we all know that one side of the industry is to ensure that capital markets work effectively, and by allocating capital investment managers contribute to market efficiency and to correct price information. This facilitates both primary issuance when companies or governments are trying to raise money, and secondary trading of different instruments. Without this, capital markets cannot grow effectively and may even destabilise. Investment managers thus contribute to sustainable growth, benefiting both clients and non-clients.\nThe UK investment management industry also has a central role in the economy as it channels savings into investment. The industry’s clients are both retail savers and institutions such as pension schemes and insurance companies, who themselves act on behalf of millions of individuals, in the UK and all over the world.\nOne of the fundamental purposes of investment management is to deliver good outcomes to those individual clients. This includes providing expertise and achieving economies of scale that allow access to a wide range of assets that would normally be out of reach for individual investors. Using shares, bonds and other assets such as property, investment managers can deliver returns over many years, while managing the risk appropriately, that allows people to save and invest to achieve their future goals and ambitions; whether that is a new car or kitchen, a much needed holiday or a secure retirement.\nSo, we as the Guild representing this industry have an important, and I would go so far as to say a unique opportunity to make a positive impact on society through good practice.... I believe as well that there is an urgent need to communicate the valuable social utility provided by this industry that has in recent years been obscured by the need to prop up the financial system and the big names following the GFC, at the expense of communicating how the industry serves individuals across the nation.\nSo at this point it is entirely appropriate recognise the inspiration and vision of the Founding and Past Master, Mark Henderson. And we would all like to recognise that inspiration and vision, seeing the gap in the Livery world that existed, which once identified was of course so obvious given the size of the industry, it’s place in the City, financial services and the nation. Mark, without that vision, and your energy, determination and enthusiasm this Guild would not have been brought into existence, and for that we all, the industry as a whole and the wider Livery movement owe you a huge debt of gratitude. So to mark this unique achievement we would like to present you with a small gift.\nYou will see that it is wrapped, and you may spot that the paper is pink in colour, which may give you a clue as to what is inside – which is a framed copy of the Financial Times of March 2018 – the day on which the nascent Guild was formally recognised and approved by the Court of Aldermen. And the wording on the back reads\nTo mark the end of your year as the Founding Master of the Guild of Investment Managers and in recognition of your vision, and the tireless energy and enthusiasm that you have brought to the Guild. With grateful thanks from the Court.\nMark very well done and many thanks.\nMark I know one part of your vision was also to have a Guild that is open and inclusive and to that I know you will share my delight in celebrating Melissa becoming a Warden today, which shows our commitment to walk the walk as well as talking the talk. But we’ve all got to play our part in this, not just in gender diversity but also making sure that we are open and welcoming to all people whatever\nthe colour, creed and orientation. And this is a message that we need to take back into our businesses.\nAnd this also speaks of the Guild charity that is primarily seeking to improve awareness of the investment management industry, and the important role it provides in enabling people to help people achieve their financial goals by education.\nHow are we going to achieve this? By participating and joining in. At the moment our membership is mid-60’s – that’s numbers not age(!), and we need and aim to grow this. So, can I ask that every member here commits to introducing one new member by the end of 2019. As far as joining in is concerned, whilst we didn’t have any members standing for election to the Court – which as far as I am aware is a privilege unique to this Guild, there are a number of committees that run the Guild, including a membership committee, and I would like to extend an invitation to anyone who would like to be more involved to let the Clerk know if you would be willing to join in in this way – it is not onerous and provides a good opportunity to meet other Guild members.\nAnd finally I would like to acknowledge our guests here this evening, many of whom are our better halves; who support, encourage and at times no doubt give us a shoulder to cry on/vent, and say thank you to them for the support they provide that enable us to do what we do in this context. We are very grateful to you.\nAnd so, can I ask us all to rise for the toast, which is the guests and the Guild of Investment Managers – the guests and the Guild of investment Managers.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_200-years-of-independence-in-brazil/content_21.html": "04 October 2022\n200 years of independence in Brazil\nHaving been born in Brazil, it is a country that I have much affection for, and so it was a particular delight to join The Ambassador of Brazil, Mr Fred Arruda, and Mrs Lenice Arruda, at Cadogan Hall for a celebratory concert to mark the 200th anniversary of Brazil's independence last month.\nWednesday 7th September marked the 200th anniversary of Brazil's independence after three centuries of Portuguese rule. Having been born in Brazil, it is a country that I have much affection for, and so it was a great privilege to be invited to join The Ambassador of Brazil, Mr Fred Arruda, and Mrs Lenice Arruda, at Cadogan Hall for a celebratory concert to mark the occasion.\nBrazil’s unique story\nThe story of Brazil's independence is as unique as the country itself. Independence was declared in 1822 by the Crown Prince Pedro. However, fourteen years earlier, Rio de Janeiro had become the capital of a European Empire when King João VI, his family and thousands of courtiers, crossed the Atlantic, escorted by the British fleet, to escape Napoleon's armies.\nWhen João VI eventually returned to Lisbon, he left Pedro in Rio and he became the first Emperor of Brazil, making it unique in the Americas as it became independent as a monarchy. That monarchical system remained in situ until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the subsequent proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889.\nCelebrating past, present and future\nThe evening at Cadogan Hall included a concert performed by the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Neil Thompson and with pianist Sonia Rubinsky, who expertly performed Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras no.9, Almeida Prado's Concerto Fribourgeois, Cláudio Santoro's Concerto Grosso, and Carlos Gomes' Sonata in D.\nImportantly, the 200 year celebration of independence was not just a commemoration of an important event in Brazil's past, but of everything the nation has achieved since - not least its vibrant and diverse culture, its immense and inspiring creativity and its talent for football. A taste of that spirit was beautifully exhibited in the concert - a thoughtful way of commemorating the past and looking forward to the future.\nFor those interested in exploring Brazil's history further, you may find the Rest is History podcast by historians Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook of interest. In the latter half of episode 229. Portugal: Gold, Earthquakes, and Brazil, they explore the move to independence, the experience of individuals, and the journey towards Brazil’s assertion of its own identity.\nFor my own part, it’s a joy to join together and celebrate the successes, achievements and hopes of different nations together - may there be many more opportunities to do so.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_esg-and-impact-investment-space-future/content_72.html": "27 October 2020\nESG and Impact Investment Space Future\nThis month marks the end of my four-year tenure on the board of Investing for Good, an impact-driven sustainable and social finance intermediary. Founded in 2004, Investing for Good has a mission to grow the pool of investment capital that is mobilised for social purpose, resulting in measurable benefits for society. My departure seems like an appropriate time to reflect on the recent evolution of this investment space and look ahead to its future in light of the global pandemic.\nWhat is Impact Investment and ESG?\nImpact investment is geared towards mobilising capital on the calculated assessment that it will deliver direct impact to a specific cause or community. Most investments are small-scale, in private-markets, and can cover an array of asset classes, including infrastructure and private debt, making for highly varied portfolios. In terms of its market size, the IFC claimed in their 2020 ‘Growing Impact’ report that 887 funds worldwide subscribe to the IFC’s impact criteria of intent, contribution and measurement[1] and had $505 billion of assets under management (AUM) in 2019. A more generous reading, incorporating the 891 funds without a robust measurement system takes this figure to $2 trillion AUM[2]. Closely related is ESG (environmental, social and governance) investment which also emphasises sustainable solutions, however there are two fundamental divergences from impact investment. The first is lower intentionality and evaluation precision, and the second is that financial return drives social impact, not vice versa. Partners Capital report that approximately 13% of global invested assets (which are worth $270 trillion) are now in ESG[3].\nHow has Impact Investment and ESG investment grown in the last four years?\nImpact investment and ESG investment have grown rampantly in the last four years. According to Investing for Good, the impact investing market size has doubled in two years[4], while capital inflows into the ESG market have increased by 14% a year for the last four years[5]. Much of this growth, particularly that of ESG, has come from an increasing recognition that environmental, social and governance considerations are no longer considered a minority concern, but are simply best practice. The issues at the receiving end of invested capital, such as climate protection, infrastructure, and national health drive economies in the first place, and their security is intimately tied to holistic portfolio performance. In the same way, subscription to ESG investment means firms avoid the risk of severe regulatory penalty and the threat to stock market valuation of shareholder, investor, and employee exile. These costs were all incurred by both Boohoo and Volkswagen following their respective supply chain and carbon emissions scandals and will continue to be administered if firms dismiss their contribution towards the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development goals. Therefore, it certainly cannot be said anymore that ESG is a case of trading value for values.\nOn the impact side, we have witnessed the emerging phenomenon of impact-adjusted returns – a proposed reform to accounting standards which many experts in social finance expect will become more authoritative in the years to come. This year, Harvard Business School ran the Impact-Weighted Accounts Project which assessed corporate environmental impact using technology and big data. Strikingly, it found that of the 1,694 companies assessed, 15% would see all profit more than wiped out by the environmental damage they have caused[6]. The turn to this alternative, rigorous form of portfolio assessment is a pattern corroborated by my old colleagues at Investing for Good, who attest to higher recent demand for their consultancy in proving impact to stakeholders[7].\nGrowth of impact investment may also be reflected in the boom of green bonds. One of the fastest-growing markets, green bond issuance has grown rapidly over the past four years and is still forecast to hit $175bn-$222bn for 2020 despite the incidence of Covid-19[8]. These investments are perhaps the most attractive and best-suited to an impact-adjusted returns standard because their impact can be dependably and independently verified and empirically compared to other investments of the same class. In fact, Sir Roger Gifford, the Past Lord Mayor and Chair of the Green Finance Institute, goes as far as to say that “green bonds are the best example of impact investment”[9]. Further than just producing a perceptible, quantifiable impact, green bonds also tend to offer competitive yields. The World Bank green bond yield, for instance, is the same as other issued non-green bond yields, and has thus far been unaffected by the recent high demand.\nThe impact of Covid-19\nAs impact investing primarily occurs in private markets, assets managed for impact have escaped significant impact from the Covid-19 pandemic. For the likes of Investing for Good, structuring work has occurred as before, but there are fewer grants available to clients in developing countries. However, in terms of sector trajectory, the onset of Covid-19 has arguably attracted greater interest in impact investing and ESG than ever before. Covid-19 has reminded us that both our domestic and global economies are highly complex and interconnected, shaking our habits and our narrow lenses. It has proven that matters of sustainability like human health are inextricably linked with our financial system. As a result, we are surely wise to take a more holistic approach to investment than we did pre-crisis, allocating capital based on an accounting of the entire operations of a firm.\nDavid Blood, Generation Investment Management (former Goldman Sachs CEO of Asset Management): “Impact can no longer be an externality in investment”.[10]\nSir Roger Gifford, Past Lord Mayor and Chair of the Green Finance Institute: “we are receiving new understanding of the triangulation of finance, science and society”[11].\nIndeed, recent findings from J.P. Morgan Chase suggest that 71% of polled top global investors believe the incidence of a high impact, low probability event like Covid-19 will heighten awareness and feed efforts in finance to address similar threats with a higher probability, like climate change[12], especially in a time when the public sector is shackled by immense debt and reflation challenges. However, it is feasible that the catalysing effect on impact or ESG investing will not be realised for a few years yet. The financial sector will first have to deal with major economic disruption, risk-averse investors, and the fast rebalancing of portfolios in the short-term, which may jeopardise some impact investments.\nHow Covid-19 might affect the emphases of E/S/G\nIn normal circumstances, social bonds are traditionally one of the least prominent investment vehicles because of the difficulty of accurately comparing performance across different investments of the same class, and for their relative illiquidity compared to the green bond market. Nevertheless, in 2019, there was a 61% increase in social bond issuance from the year before[13]; a trend that Covid-19 has only accentuated with matters of public health, social security, and social housing sitting high on political and investment agendas, and more salient in the consciousness of the wider citizenry, who care more now than ever about where their pensions are being spent. The outworking of this is already manifest – on the 21st October, the EU issued an inaugural €17bn social bond under the EU SURE instrument (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) which was met by a monumental €233bn of investor demand – the largest supranational transaction ever launched[14].\nAlex Jarman, Head of Investment Advisory, Investing for Good: “The social component of ESG investing is still the laggard, but this could well be a fightback”[15].\nConsiderations of governance have also received more emphasis during the pandemic. Whilst transparent governance structures are integral to effective business practice in any period, Covid-19 has crystallised the reputational significance of upholding high standards of protection for workers and stakeholders, and the ability to demonstrate stability and ongoing viability to investors amidst turbulent conditions.\nThe effect on environmental considerations is perhaps a little more complicated to discern. The green bond market suffered sharply in the first quarter, brought on by economic uncertainty and the subversion of environmental debate to international health, and it also endured a muted second quarter. Nevertheless, demand for these instruments, along with red and blue bonds, have rallied to a comparably healthy rate to last year. In a similar fashion to the social considerations, it appears likely that instead of slowing the environmental charge, the pandemic will instead push the reality of crises deeper into the public conscience. The steady stream of trillions that investors are willing to contribute to the decarbonisation effort show no signs of tailing off and I call on all those that have influence over allocation of capital to consider how their future decisions and actions might consider environmental, social and governance factors and be more impactful for the greater good.\nSupporters of Investing for Good\nReference:\n[1] IFC report: 9 principles for impact management, p.16\n[3] Partners Capital, A Roadmap for an Evolving Frontier Agenda (webinar), 13/10/2020\n[4] Personal contact with Alex Jarman, Head of Investment Advisory, Investing for Good, 16/10/2020\n[5] Partners Capital, A Roadmap for an Evolving Frontier Agenda (webinar), 13/10/2020\n[6] Harvard Business Review: How to measure a company’s real impact\n[7] Personal contact with Alex Jarman, 16/10/2020\n[8] Business Green, Global Green bond market rallies toward Covid-19 recovery\n[9] Personal contact with Sir Roger Gifford, 13/10/2020\n[10] Quote from ESG and Impact Investing: A Roadmap for an Evolving Frontier Agenda (webinar) ESG and Impact Investing: A Roadmap for an Evolving Frontier Agenda (webinar), 13/10/2020\n[11] Personal contact with Sir Roger Gifford, 13/10/2020\n[12] JP Morgan, Why COVID-19 Could Prove to Be a Major Turning Point for ESG Investing\n[13] IFC, Growing Impact Report: New Insights into the Practice of Impact Investing, p.11\n[14] CNBC, The EU makes market history with record demand for its ‘social’ bonds’, [Accessed via: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/21/eu-social-bonds-draw-historic-demand.html]",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_is-tradition-still-relevant-in-the-city/content_29.html": "29 March 2022\nIs tradition still relevant in The City?\nTradition is a big part of the City of London - its structure, its governance, its architecture, and in plenty of the annual rituals and ceremonies. The question is, are they still relevant or is it just pomp and circumstance?\nRecently I wrote about how innovation is an integral part of The City of London, but alongside that forward-thinking outlook, tradition also plays a fundamental role in the strength and resilience of the business community.\nThis is represented in hundreds of ways - its structure, its governance, its architecture, and in plenty of the annual rituals and ceremonies. The question is, are they still relevant or is it just pomp and circumstance?\nThe Queen and The City\nFebruary this year marked an exciting moment for the UK. It was the official start of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee year, which will hopefully soon see us participating in lots of celebrations over the summer. Her Majesty’s role is rooted in tradition. The same can be said of her relationship with The City of London - consider an occasion like the Ceremony of the Pearl Sword, for example.\nThis type of ceremonial event is the sort of thing that comes to mind when we think of tradition (although many are less ornate), and especially when we think of monarchy. In many ways, it seems a bit unnecessary after 400 years. The respect between The City and the monarch is not in question. However, such events continue to attract crowds and carry a sense of reverence - why?\nStability in a time of flux\nFrom a philosophical perspective, I think tradition grounds us and gives us a point of reference. At the moment, with the world in such flux, wherever you look societally, commercially, politically, we are all searching for a sense of stability. A lot of people are, given that flux, casting about for purpose, meaning, roots, a foundation, something to hold onto. In some ways tradition gives us that. That’s not to say that it should be taken and retained forever more; it’s an evolving thing - like having a plan that adapts as you move forward.\nTradition can also be a very good reminder of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it. As we go along our paths and get distracted by the daily minutiae or concerned by the annual ebb and flow of the economy, it can be helpful to be reminded of the path that we’re on. It can be reassuring and motivating to know that there is value in things having stood the test of time over many economic and social cycles. To know that while change is important and necessary, sometimes things are done a particular way for a good reason. It can be something to refer to, drawing strength and understanding from it.\nI suppose in a sense, tradition is a little like turning to a parent. We all go through a period where we think our parents know nothing at all, and then at some point decide they might have something useful to contribute after all. I am reminded of the quote:\n“When I was 18, I thought my father was pretty dumb. After a while when I got to be 21, I was amazed to find out how much he'd learned in three years.”\nMore than self-service\nThe sense of purpose that tradition can engender is also something I feel strongly about. It’s fundamental to our flourishing as individuals that we seek to serve something beyond ourselves. If we’re just self-serving we become very small people emotionally and relationally. We have a need to serve something bigger than ourselves and, in a sense, tradition can give us the tram tracks on which to do that. Last week we had the City Common Council elections, and now see all the new Common Councillors step into that long line of tradition, which in turn has influenced local governance across the country.\nIn the context of the Queen’s Jubilee, I think that this sense of service is particularly prevalent. When people think about Her Majesty, her image is inextricably linked to her service to the country, Commonwealth and her people. She’s a magnificent sovereign because she’s served unfailingly and within that traditional (as opposed to old fashioned) construct.\nWith that in mind, The City itself is here to serve the nation and individuals across it. While it may be associated with the Square Mile, its importance for the UK as a whole is immense. I have referred to The City as being a battery pack for the UK, and I think that role only gets greater over time.\nIn one sense, The City serves the people who work within it - helping them to thrive in their careers, have happy, healthy, prosperous lives and well-earned retirements, but it’s more than that. The City isn’t and shouldn’t be self-serving. At the end of the day, while there might be lots of B2B work that happens, there are individuals at the end of the service chain, and that’s ultimately what it’s all about. The traditions that we have are there to help ensure that service is delivered.\nSo, while the Pearl Sword, the coronation robes, the dragon on the City’s coat of arms, and many more ceremonies and traditions besides often seem like pure pageantry, I think they give us much more than that as well. If we look at the purpose behind the traditions we can ascertain if, how and to what extent they are relevant today, understanding the values that they are signposting and guiding us to represent within our own community and on the world stage.",

  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_improving-the-nation-s-financial-health/content_64.html": "04 March 2024\nImproving the nation's financial health\nOne of my great passions is enabling financial independence and autonomy, which I think requires greater access to financial education and a collective review of our attitude towards debt. I have put down some thoughts in this article and would be interested in your perspective.\nIt was a great privilege to start 2024 by being re-elected as Alderman for the Ward of Cheap. Never taking anything for granted, the outcome was a relief to me, and I'm delighted to have the trust and confidence of the voters across the Ward once again. I continue in my belief that it's a privilege to serve and I'm committed to representing our community with passion and integrity.\nI have taken much time to consider my goals and objectives for my forthcoming term, focusing on how we can individually and collectively support one another within the City, and in turn how the City can support the nation beyond. I stand firm in my belief that the City of London is an extraordinary place, with the power to create enormous good for individuals within its sphere and across the UK.\nIn many ways, I think the three points of theologian John Wesley's famous sermon entitled, The Use of Money, sums up what I believe to be the best of the City’s capabilities:\n\"Earn all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\"\nWithin that outlook lies so many truisms - you cannot give what you do not have, hard work is a virtue, and we are all connected and responsible for ourselves and one another. I believe that financial health is inextricably linked with physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. However, while we live in an age where we speak more than ever about wellness, I do not think we empower individuals to take care of their financial health as much as we could. In this, I believe the City can and should take up the mantle to educate, enable and empower, remembering always that national finances are really an accumulation of individual financial experiences.\nSobering statistics\nThe Mental Health Foundation writes that money worries are the most common cause of anxiety with 32% of UK adults saying that being able to afford to pay the bills had made them feel anxious recently. There is also enormous shame associated with money worries, which perpetuates the issue.\nThe problem is not hypothetical - the figures alone are fairly anxiety making. According to a survey by the Money and Pensions Service (MaPs), around a quarter of UK adults (11.5 million people) have less than £100 in their savings account, with one in six people having no savings at all. Meanwhile, Jeremy Warner wrote in the Telegraph: \"As a proportion of national income, Britain has one of the lowest savings rates in the OECD\", with the UK savings ratio standing at 1.7%, the lowest level since the 1960s.\nThat’s all set within a much wider context of ever-increasing public debt. The Office of National Statistics reports that: \"Public sector net debt (PSND ex) was £2,599.0 billion at the end of September 2023 and was provisionally estimated at around 97.8% of the UK’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).\" That's 2.1 percentage points higher than in September 2022 and it’s expected to continue to rise over the next 20 years.\nI think that by addressing two key factors we can make significant improvements – the first is to amend our relationship with debt both individually and collectively. The second is to provide greater access to financial education so that people feel more empowered to take charge of their own fortunes.\nThe question of debt\nWe know there are big challenges relating to the rising cost of living, inflation and other significant factors that have added to this context in the last few years, but they alone are not the cause or the solution to Britain’s money worries.\nThe question of debt is one that I believe we need a mindset shift on. The expansion of credit culture means we are losing its benefits and are becoming individually and collectively trapped in it. Credit can be an important tool for economic flexibility, but it is just a contract and has no owner in the way that equity or property has an owner. Therefore, responsibility is diminished in debt structures relative to ownership structures. We saw this writ large in the credit crunch when the global economy nearly imploded. A large part of the reason for this was too much easy debt, and yet our response has been to create more debt.\nRemembering Gordon Brown’s Jubilee 2000 debt initiative, we must find creative ways of reducing it and the instability it creates in the economy. Currently the corporate tax regime favours debt finance rather than equity finance. This is the wrong way round to my mind and must be rectified. Similarly, stamp duty is payable on equities but not debt instrument trades, which again is the wrong way round and policy needs to be introduced to rectify this.\nThe age-old concepts of Jubilee in Judeo-Christian teaching and Sharia finance both point to a better policy than the current norms. To this end, having fixed-term credit, where the risk reverts to the lender and/or partnership each provides a useful starting template for a different way forward. Ultimately, a culture and policy of ownership and responsibility needs to be created rather than one that prioritises borrowing.\nEducation to empower individuals\nCulturally we have got used to an expectation of immediacy. It takes a long time to become an overnight success (whatever that means to you), with most people spending a lifetime slowly and steadily putting the pieces in place. However, somehow X-Factor culture and social media has made life’s biggest achievements seem like they should come easily, or at least has diminished their significance. It’s a big deal to buy a house, to save for a well-earned retirement, to have the resources to raise children and look after one's family. These are not small things to manage, and they should be celebrated when they are.\nI think part of the reason these things have become so out of reach for many is that financial education is profoundly lacking in our system. That’s not to downplay the economic challenges that individuals across the country face – on the contrary, it’s to say that it’s our responsibility as a community and as a society to give people more tools to make their money work harder for them.\nIt’s often said that compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. With that in mind, I don’t think we emphasise enough the importance of starting early with small amounts when it comes to savings and investments. If you save £100 per month between from the age of 25 you will have twice as much as person who starts at 35 by the time you retire – that is the power of compound interest. These are the things we need to be teaching our children, as well as giving adults who want to be more empowered access to learning tools.\nFinancial education is an area in which the City can make a significant contribution. For example, at Rathbones I set up the company’s first financial awareness programme for young people around 20 years ago and that’s something we’ve continued doing. It was aimed at people aged 16 to 24, but we have subsequently realised a lot of adults are not taught about finance. Often in a partnership or a marriage one person takes responsibility for the accounts and if the other is left alone through death, divorce or disease, they are left vulnerable. Therefore, we introduced adult awareness courses as well.\nAlongside that, there’s the Lord Mayor’s Appeal, which has National Numeracy as one of its charity partners. While that’s not explicitly about financial awareness, we know that if you’re more confident with numbers you’re more likely to engage with finances (a survey showed 54% of the UK's working age population has low numeracy).\nAutonomy and community\nA rising tide lifts all boats and it’s important that we seek to enable and empower those around us where we can. Financial health is a powerful and important thing for individuals to have for themselves and for the country as a whole.\nIt’s through being empowered to have financial independence that we become privileged to be in a position to give, whether it be to charity or in some other way, contributing to a better world around us and knowing that we’re all vulnerable to life’s twists and turns - there but for the grace of God go I.\nI would like to see our attitude and infrastructure around debt reconsidered to that end, and I would like to see improvements around financial education made more widely available and promoted. Over the coming months I will explore the topic in more depth, and hopefully we can move the dial to make a difference.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_what-kind-of-place-do-we-want-the-city-to-be/content_33.html": "14 June 2022\nWhat kind of place do we want The City to be?\nI wanted to take a moment to think about the role we can play as a community in the City of London to ensure a compassionate environment in which we live and work.\n“Loneliness kills, it’s as powerful as smoking or alcoholism”\nProfessor Robert Waldinger\nA few weeks ago I shared this quote on LinkedIn. One of the great human challenges of our time is loneliness, and this quote struck a chord with me, not least because in the last couple of months I know of three people who have died by suicide. It is sadly not uncommon.\nWhen we think about what we want The City to be going forward, it isn’t just about its commercial achievements and its corporate prowess on the world stage. It’s also about the culture and community that we nurture for ourselves and for future generations.\nLoneliness is a global issue. Never before have we had more opportunities to communicate with one another, but at the same time so many feel isolated and disconnected. For lots of people that feeling was brought to the fore by the Covid-19 lockdowns - perhaps a positive side effect of the pandemic might be a greater empathy for one another in that regard.\nThe state of loneliness\nLoneliness is not an issue confined to The City, and as we all know, it isn’t necessarily about being alone - it is more complicated and more diverse than that.\nA study conducted by Thomas Howard Suitt at Brown University found that between 11th September 2001 and 2021, there had been 7,057 combat deaths in the US military. However, the same period showed that there had been 30,177 suicides by service members and veterans during the post 9/11 war operations.\nThe Reconceptualising Loneliness in London report released in March 2022 estimated that 700,000 Londoners felt lonely ‘always’ or ‘most of the time’ prior to the pandemic - a situation that has only escalated since. It found that Londoners are more likely than people in other parts of Britain to be affected by lonteliness.\nIn the report, Dr. Debbie Weekes-Bernard, London's Deputy Mayor for Communities and Social Justice, said:\n“Since becoming Deputy Mayor, I have seen even greater strain placed on Londoners’ sense of belonging. The alienating effects of Brexit, the inequalities that the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated, and the systemic racial injustices that brought the Black Lives Matter movement to prominence have revealed the isolation of being unheard and excluded from the very place people call home.”\nLoneliness in The City\nDespite the challenge however, we are also increasingly aware as a society of mental health and its challenges, the vulnerabilities of our fellow beings and the need, not to fix, but to provide support and compassion.\nThere are formal processes in place to support one another, and incredible charities like the Samaritans. As an example, in 2017, the City of London Corporation established a multi-agency suicide prevention group and published a Suicide Prevention Action Plan containing numerous initiatives aimed at reducing the number of suicides in the Square Mile. There is also the pioneering City wide mental health campaign, This is Me, initiated and led by the Lord Mayor’s Appeal team.\nI know many businesses also have their own internal processes and systems to support the mental and emotional wellbeing of clients - mental health first aiders, for example. Those things all help to create an invaluable infrastructure through which we try to support one another.\nCommunity and compassion\nNonetheless, I think this is about the culture we create as much as anything else. Dr. Weekes-Bernard was observant in writing:\n“The multifaceted nature of severe loneliness in London means it requires a multifaceted response to bring about change.”\nLoneliness is a challenge for the whole community, and arguably one that only a community can really provide meaningful resolution for. Perhaps we will never be able to reach everyone, but everyone deserves us to make the effort.\nIf you or someone you know is suffering from loneliness and/or struggling with mental health please do contact the Samaritans or you can reach me here.",

  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_in-the-interests-of-justice/content_20.html": "15 October 2024\nIn the interests of justice\nAs Alderman Gregory Jones KC takes up his position as aldermanic Sheriff for the upcoming year, making him the first KC to be appointed sheriff in some 900 years. Having also been delighted to receive the nomination for the shrievalty in 11 months time, I have been reflecting on the realms of law and justice in support of the current sheriff as well as considering my own personal belief in it as a core value within our society.\nSeptember saw the installation of Alderman Gregory Jones KC as the Aldermanic Sheriff for the upcoming year, making him the first KC to be appointed Sheriff in some 900 years.\nHaving been delighted to receive the nomination for the shrievalty in 11 months time, I think reflecting on the rule of law and the importance of justice is apt. After all, the two Sheriffs of London spend their elected year living and working at the Old Bailey, the UK's central criminal court, crowned by a glittering figure of Justice. As it happens, 2025 also marks the 800th anniversary of the sealing of the 1225 version of Magna Carta, which enshrined the principle that no one, not even the monarch and their government is above the law.\nI have therefore been thinking about the realms of law and justice, in support of the current sheriff as well as considering my own personal belief in it as a core value within our society.\nJustice for all\nWhilst I am a fund manager rather than lawyer, the law is a profession I have spent my life living adjacent to. My wife, Elspeth, is a lawyer, as is my sister and my cousin. The confines of the law, also, naturally work in tandem with delivering the best of all City business, not to mention the wider society of which we are all members.\nWhere recent events, as well as my nomination have found me ruminating however, is not merely on legislation but what justice actually means to us as a community. In the American constitution the 14th Amendment refers to 'justice for all'. In the UK in 2002, the Criminal Justice White Paper, Justice For All \"outlined a coherent, long term strategy to modernise the criminal justice system from end to end – from detection through to rehabilitation of offenders.\" The phrase was then posed as a question in a 2017 speech by our now Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, looking at his review into race in the criminal justice system. Alongside a series of recommendations for a fairer system, he said:\n\"Nothing justifies criminal behaviour. People end up in prison when they make bad choices. But we also have to grasp what it is that leads them to do so.\"\nOf course, these are just a few in a litany of times the phrase \"justice for all\" has been employed, entreating us to be our best and do our best by one another. It's as much an entreaty to the authorities as to individuals, to remember their duty to society. However, when we break it down, what does it mean both practically and ideologically?\nMy belief is that it can be best addressed in three parts:\n- Justice for the accused\n- Justice for survivors\n- Justice for prison leavers\nJustice for the accused\nInnocent until proven guilty, or the presumption of innocence, has been a hallmark of the UK's legal system for a long time. The Ministry of Justice notes that the concept dates back to Ancient Rome, but it was officially provided for by section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.\nThe right to an unbiased defence, the speed of prosecution and reduction in the use of detention without trial, a clear understanding of one’s sentence including its term, its conditions and its consequences are all part of that process. We know that despite a robust and globally admired justice system, these are things that can always be improved upon as we continuously adapt to the demands of an ever-changing society, and at the moment all evidence indicates we are falling short.\nIn a sobering article in the Financial Times last weekend, titled How the English courts reached breaking point, journalist Henry Mance reports on the time to trial. His point is illustrated via the apology of Judge Charles Falk at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, to a defendant who will have to wait two years for a hearing, placing the lives of all involved on hold until that time. Mance writes: \"So these defendants and victims learn what barristers have said for years: the criminal justice system of England and Wales is blocked and probably broken.\"\nThe article goes on to note that in early 2019 there were 33,000 cases outstanding in the Crown Courts, but by the end of 2023 that number had reached nearly 68,000. He adds: \"There are no up-to-date figures because embarrassingly the Ministry of Justice has discovered problems with its data.\"\nThe legal maxim, ‘justice delayed is justice denied’, casts a gloomy shadow over our much lauded judicial system, with all parties suffering at every point in the process. Standout figures in Mance’s article include:\n- \"Since 2019, the average time between a crime happening and the Crown Court case ending has gone from 16 months to 22 months.\"\n- \"Between 2019 and 2023, the number of adult rape cases awaiting trial trebled to 2,786.\"\n- \"Some prisons such as Wandsworth had 50 per cent more prisoners than they could decently accommodate.\"\n- \"One in four trials now doesn’t go ahead as scheduled.\"\nAnother notable challenge to justice for the accused at the moment is the issue of remaining IPP prisoners. The indeterminate prison penalty (IPP), or a sentence without a set release date, is a concept that was removed from the Statute Book last year, but it still leaves a number of people without a definitive end date to their prison term.\nJustice for survivors\nJustice for survivors is a concept that I think we all appreciate, understand and want, but we see challenges to it play out everyday. Justice, or a lack thereof, for the people of Grenfell is widely reported for having still not been achieved seven years on - timely outcomes are a crucial part of justice for victims.\nOn another note, violence against women has been reported as a ‘national emergency’ in England and Wales. A 2024 National Police Chiefs’ Council analysis for violence against women and girls (VAWG) found:\n- Over one million VAWG related crimes were recorded during 2022/23, accounting for 20% of all police recorded crime.\n- Police recorded VAWG related crime increased by 37% between 2018/23.\n- At least one in every 12 women will be a victim per year, with the exact number expected to be much higher.\n- Child sexual abuse and exploitation increased by more than 400% between 2013 and 2022.\n- They reported 3,000 VAWG offences are recorded each day.\nFurthermore, there's a significant delay for justice. In March this year The Guardian reported that \"more than 180 alleged rape victims have faced more than two years of delays since case first went to court\", adding:\n\"According to CBA analysis, in the second quarter of last year a total of 211 bailed rape trials completed with an average charge to completion time of 558 days, compared with 262 bailed rape trials in the first quarter of 2018, with an average charge to completion time of 328 days.\"\nIn addition, the issue of modern slavery and human trafficking persists, with a 2023 House of Commons Committee report saying: \"that there are at least 100,000 victims of modern slavery and human trafficking in the UK\".\nJustice for prison leavers\nThis year has seen the concept of justice for both victims and ex-offenders play out with particular questions both for the government and society with the overcrowding of our prisons.\nWith so many people leaving prison at any time, but especially with the wave of around 1,750 former offenders released early in September, the challenges of helping people to put their life back on an even keel cannot be dismissed.\nThe overall proven reoffending rate in the UK has fluctuated between 23.1% and 31.8% in recent years. While it's easy to blame the perpetrator, we know that there's a lack of adequate and consistent support for prison leavers (reported by the National Audit Office) which exacerbates the problem.\nWhile it's a complex and multifaceted area, the lack of safe accommodation and employment opportunities are repeatedly cited as barriers to progress, and the latter is something I think the City is in a position to do more about.\nA City of justice\nI don't raise these topics to suggest that the City can solve them all, but I do believe that if we all do something then a lot can be achieved, and the City and its community are in a powerful collective position to raise awareness and drive change.\nPhilosophically, I believe in mercy and grace. Society and humanity need that to live a healthy life, otherwise we're constantly aggrieved. Flowing out of that you get forgiveness and redemption, and hopefully you also get more kindness, understanding and better outcomes.\nIn financial services we understand redemption in terms of bonds - when the term is served and the principal repaid, it matures and moves on - hopefully, having become richer in the process. Broadly speaking, it's a principle that works, perhaps it has greater application?",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_shrieval-briefing-10th-february-2025/content_62.html": "12 February 2025\nShrieval Briefing 10th February 2025\nThe Shrieval Briefing on 10th February 2025 brought together Liverymen and Liverywomen to support the Court of Aldermen's nominee for Sheriff. Robert Hughes-Penney shared his vision for the Shrieval role—supporting the Lord Mayor, strengthening the justice system, and engaging with the Livery community in the lead-up to Common Hall.\nMaster, Past Masters, Fellow Haberdashers, Liverymen and Liverywomen\nGood evening,\nMaster, thank you for your kind introduction, and so kindly and generously allowing this briefing and reception to take place in the Hall this evening. It is a huge privilege to be here, and I am very grateful to you for your support.\nAnd may I add my own welcome to all our guests this evening, I am enormously encouraged by your interest, your support, and your enthusiasm – thank you!\nAs you will be aware, I have received the Court of Aldermen’s nomination to stand for election at Common Hall on midsummer’s day as Sheriff of this great City – I am delighted and humbled to have received that nomination, but now the rest is up to you, the Liverymen and Liverywomen of this great City to attend Common Hall and cast you votes appropriately!\nWhilst we are probably all aware of the tradition that the Court of Aldermen’s nomination is supported by the electorate; and the other Shrieval candidate, or indeed candidates!, I am hugely conscious that it is the Livery that is the electorate. Accordingly, the uppermost purpose of this evening in my mind is to be very clear of my desire to honour and respect that electorate, by being known, accessible and visible to you all in the run up to Common Hall.\nAnd that is the purpose of this evening; an invitation was extended to each and every Livery Company, and some of the affiliated Livery groupings that I am part of to come to this briefing reception, ahead of the electoral timetable. So, may I thank you for joining me this evening and your interest and support, which means a lot to me.\nI am touched by the support of fellow Haberdasher Court members that I see here; and as the Alderman for the Ward of Cheap I am fortunate to have four Livery Halls and another dozen or so companies with offices and storage facilities in my Ward – welcome to my fellow Cheapsiders. It is also lovely to see friends from my Past Masters year group, the Zoomers, the Financial Services Group of companies, including investment managers, the HAC Livery Association and colleagues from Rathbones who are members of a wide range of companies.\nBy way of introduction and background for those that don’t know me; I was born in Brazil, possibly the first Alderman and potentially the first Sheriff to have that claim, where my father was working for Price Waterhouse. Then after a spell in South Africa we returned to the UK when I was 10 and later I went to the Haberdashers’ Boys’ School for the sixth form, which in many ways is where the connection and interest in the City started.\nAfter graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University and passing out of Sandhurst I was commissioned into the 13th/18th Royal Hussars and served in the UK, Canada and Germany before starting work in the City at the end of 1993 – over 31 years ago.\nOn arriving in the City and seeking to be involved in life outside the office I reached out to the Haberdashers’ Co. and by wonderful serendipity with my last commanding officer and new City CEO both being Haberdashers a place was found for me in the Company. And it’s been a huge privilege to be part of this wonderful Company, that I am sure you all know does such wonderful work, particularly in the education space. In that vein I spent eight years as a governor of Haberdashers’ Girls, chaired the City Civic committee and the Securities committee and served on the charities and finance committees.\nAnd it was through my great friend, Past Master Nigel Branson, former Common Councilman and Sheriff that my interest in serving as an elected member of the Corporation was sparked. This led to eight years as an elected Common Councillor, prior to being elected as an Alderman seven years ago.\nMeanwhile, I am fortunate to have enjoyed a career primarily as an investment manager at Rathbones, seeing the business grow over 100-fold from the one I joined, but also spending several years on the Board, executive and management committees of the main operating company. And in that vein can I thank and pay tribute to my colleagues for their encouragement and support, past present and future.\nSo, what of the Shrieval role? Of course, it is an ancient office, with records indicating it going back to the 8th century, the Sheriffs live at the Old Bailey and look after the comfort of His Majesty’s judges – at lunch and elsewhere. Both my wife, Elspeth and I are very much looking forward to that.\nBut probably even more importantly is the role of supporting the Lord Mayor. With the Sheriffs taking office in September there is the opportunity to work with two Lord Mayors. And having known the current Lord Mayor, Alastair King since 2004, over 20 years ago, and as a fellow investment manager, and also knowing the Lady Mayoress, or Lance Bombardier Kings’ heart for the military I am sure we will be able to back them as they bring their theme of growth unleashed to a conclusion.\nMore recently we have become good friends with Dame Susan Langley, the Court’s nomination to be the next Lord Mayor, or Lady Mayor, and her husband Gary. It is not for me to trail their theme or ideas but suffice to say that there are meetings planned in the weeks ahead to ensure we are on the same page, as we all seek to support and promote UK FPS and the growing tech sector. One thing I know Sue has previously spoken of is her desire to support those less privileged, mindful of her own background from the east end. And with my own maternal great grandfather having been a bone, horn and tallow chandler in Stratford, and me being the first person in my family to get a degree I look forward to supporting this.\nBesides our support for the Lord Mayor there will also be the opportunity to do one or two things at the Old Bailey; celebrating the Old Bailey as the world’s best known criminal justice court, supporting the justice system and re-employment of prison leavers. I am conscious that my year, subject to election, will coincide with the 10th anniversary of the UN SDGs and no. 16 includes justice for all; so, I am planning a Justice for All event at the start of my year. This will look at justice for the accused, justice for survivors and justice for prison leavers - please look out for that. In addition, and being the only Alderman to have served in the army, and having stood outside St Pauls on London Poppy Day last November it would be great if we could gather wider support for that this year, and last but my no means least is our support for the Sheriffs & Recorders fund; in that vein I shall be inviting each of the Livery Masters to join my wife, Elspeth and I, to come on one of the sponsored walks to each of the London prisons that we shall be arranging.\nAnd so finally, and by way of introduction, may I say that none of this will be possible without support from all of you, but even more importantly from my lovely wife, Elspeth, to whom I am eternally grateful.\nSo thank you again for coming today, as I said at the top I am keen to be known, visible and accessible to the Livery, the electorate, in the run up to Common Hall, and I look forward to seeing you all there in June. And now may I invite Elspeth to say a few words, and let us please give her a warm welcome.\nThank you,\nRobert Hughes-Penney",

Here are some of my thoughts as to how.\nThis year is quickly defining itself as a year of change. Whichever way you look there is a lot going on. There are multiple conflicts around the world, general elections looming in the UK and the United States, and whatever the outcome of both those events alone, change is the only guarantee, which is both an exciting and a disconcerting prospect.\nOn a financial score, while inflation is slowly creeping back to the Bank of England's target of 2%, which for all intents and purposes is something to be pleased about, the benefits are not yet reflected in the experiences of individuals and businesses on the ground. Like something of a turning ship, in many ways people are feeling the remaining turbulence of its wake.\nWithin that context, the role of the City is pivotal in helping to calm the waters and nurture a rising tide. Those who work to enhance the competitiveness of the City of London, do so for and with a duty to and responsibility for the economic prosperity of the nation.\nIt is a duty and responsibility I take very seriously, and many people have done wonderful things to contribute to that endeavour. They include, but are not limited to the current Lord Mayor and those that went before him, the City's Sheriffs past and present, other and previous Aldermen and women, and all those who proactively work in, for and on behalf of the City.\nIn my roles, now and going forward, I seek to build on what has gone before, and I wanted to take a moment to discuss what that looks like in action.\nEnthusiasm for British markets\nIt is over 30 years since I started work in investment management in the City. In that time, I have seen numerous crises - you may have heard the well-known saying that the stock market climbs a wall of worry, which is as true today as ever. Despite the challenges, for more than 1,000 years, the City has continued to grow, thrive and prosper, and I am confident that with continued diligence and determination we can maintain an upwards trajectory.\nHowever, that growth cannot be achieved separately to the prosperity of people across the nation. I believe it is our role within the City to equip, enable, empower and release people and businesses for the economy to fulfil its potential. To my mind, there are key economic and trade priorities that need to be focused on in order to achieve that.\nCrucially, it's about generating enthusiasm, not just for the British market, but for investing, education and to get some of the UK's economic power back. While the powers that be are integral to that process, it's essential that we get the average person engaging with British companies, increasing awareness, entrepreneurial activity and addressing some of the challenges I have written about before - not least the UK savings ratio.\nSafety in numbers\nFirstly, I think it's important to recognise that our processes have, with best intentions, removed risk from the financial system. However, as Bim Afolami MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury and City Minister recently observed, “There is no point having the safest graveyard.”\nI think we need to acknowledge that risk is a fact of life, and, particularly in financial markets, risk is not something to be fearful of because it is through navigating it successfully that we find growth. Within that, I think we need to give businesses and individuals the freedom to accept and manage risk to unleash growth and entrepreneurial spirit from the institutional level and extend it to the end consumer.\nLondon on the world stage\nI have had the privilege of living overseas, as well as spending 30 years running global multi-asset portfolios for international clients. I am therefore acutely aware of the advantages we have in London as a global finance, investment and professional services centre. I would like to see us drive home these advantages.\nLast year I worked with the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute to bring $5+ trillion assets under management (AUM) into Guildhall for their first global conference. This was a strong and clear endorsement of the City, the UK, our rule of law and the depth of professional talent that exists here. New business opportunities arose from it and I am confident will arise from this year’s event as well.\nSimilarly, this year I co-hosted the Canadian Indigenous Investment Summit at Mansion House. It was an endorsement of our historic links to Commonwealth countries and our impact investment sector. As part of the event I welcomed four Canadian indigenous chiefs, arranged the Freedom of the City for them, and underlined our diverse and inclusive culture.\nI believe in the importance of representing the UK in overseas markets and showcasing London's many assets as the global centre of excellence for financial and professional services. In turn, this should be done to help create pathways for businesses that seek to develop their global reach.\nInvesting begins at home\nThere have been many important initiatives that I think must be continued and built upon. For example, Lord Hill’s UK Listings Review, The Edinburgh Reforms, Douglas Flint’s Digitisation Taskforce, and the Mansion House Compact, all stand out together with that risk agenda for UK AUM growth.\nIt's important to remember that the AUM managed in the UK is about four times greater than the size of our domestic stock market, and that 80% of the FTSE’s earnings are derived from overseas. In short, we have global reach and connections that are second to none.\nHowever, we want to see a return to and growth in the London Stock Exchange as a proportion of global public markets and at the same time facilitate growth in, and access to, private assets and impact investment growth areas that will result in the AUM in the UK increasing.\nRemembering who we work for\nUltimately, markets, capitalism and the City are about enabling the flourishing of humanity in the round, not piling up pound coins.\nAt the end of the string of transactions that any of us is involved with there is an individual and we are here to serve them. What we do in the Square Mile is for individuals up and down the country, who are saving for a new car or kitchen, a well-earned holiday or a much-deserved retirement.\nHowever, the stats are sobering. For example, the UK has a savings rate of just 1.7%, one of the lowest in the OECD, nine million adults in this country have no savings and 11.5 million have less than £100 in their account. Research from Moneybox found that only 26% of people invested in the markets in 2023, with 36% saying they simply could not afford to - citing the cost of doing investment as a barrier.\nI have written before about the advice gap - the cost of advice, the confusion people face about investment, and the lack of incentive to do so - this needs addressing. While there have been rumblings about the proposed British ISA and some push back on that score, it is important to start somewhere and give people education and options to get involved in the markets.\nThe trusty Post Office savings account books that many of us put our pocket money into as children are no longer available and there's now no equivalent, trusted institution where people can go with modest sums and learn the art of saving from an early age.\nInspired by the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST), with its 13 million members and £39 billion in assets, I think we should be galvanised into action to improve the financial health of the nation, close the advice gap and provide a trusted route for all to save and invest.\nAs things stand, the UK market looks undervalued, but I would rather put money into an undervalued market than an overvalued one. Now is the moment for putting our individual and collective time, treasure and talent towards the health of the nation and its economy, remembering John Wesley's famous exhortation that one should \"earn all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\" I believe that in this we find not simply our jobs within the City, but our purpose as well.",

That experience has been the root of a passionate belief in the ethical as well as economic impact the City and its business community can have on the world around us. It provides me with daily motivation to represent its interests and to drive further opportunity where possible.\nThe City has given me an enormous amount - friends, professional purpose, a community and an extremely fulfilling career, enabling me to look after my family and clients as well as enhance my interest in the markets.\nMy family heritage has been intertwined with the City for generations, thanks to our roots in East London and now, two of my children are working in financial services in the City and Canary Wharf. Meanwhile my eternally supportive wife, Elspeth, is a former City corporate lawyer and now a member of The Goldsmiths' Company, based in The Ward of Cheap. I am privileged to combine this background with an international perspective, having been born in Brazil, spent time in Latin America, enjoyed my childhood in South Africa, and served in the British Army in Germany and Canada.\nIn particular, I have an affiliation with the Ward of Cheap itself. I started work just off Cheapside, my Livery Company, the Haberdashers, has its roots in Gresham Street going back to 1458, and I am Patron of the Ward of Cheap Club. Following the combination of Rathbones and Investec Wealth & Investment UK, I have an office here in the Ward at 30 Gresham Street. Therefore, it is a particular pleasure to work and vote within the Ward I represent.\nHaving served as an Alderman for six years, following eight years as a Common Councillor, my experience of the City is increasingly multifaceted, combining civic, charity and professional, roles, as well as those of family and friends. In serving you as your Alderman, I am supported by my wife, by Rathbones and by The Haberdashers’ Company. In accordance with the conventions of the City, I am delighted to have received the Court of Aldermen's nomination to serve as Sheriff from September 2025.\nAll of this, I believe, enables me to serve you effectively.\nCivic experience\nNow, with over six years experience as an Alderman, following eight years as a Common Councillor, my experience in civic roles includes:\n- City of London Corporation Committee experience as Chairman of both the Investment Committee and the Financial Investment Board, and a member of the Policy & Resources Committee (which is the main decision-making body), Finance, the Police and other Committees.\n- I am a Patron of the Ward of Cheap Club.\n- I am a Past Master of the Guild of Investment Managers, and on the Court of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, where I have served as Warden.\n- I am the Corporation’s appointee to the Board of the Impact Investing Institute.\nProfessional experience\nI have had a career in financial services spanning more than 30 years, affording me a firm understanding that the financial district exists primarily to serve people. This has included:\n- A fulfilling career to date as an Investment Director at Rathbones, with a team, managing global multi-asset portfolios over £1.25bn for individuals, families, trusts, pensions and charities.\n- I served as a Director of the company, spent 12 years as a member of the Management and Executive Committees and represented Rathbones at industry CEO events.\n- In 2010, I created and chaired what is now the Rathbones Stewardship Committee, which has engaged in issues including Arctic oil drilling, board composition, executive pay and modern-day slavery.\n- I am Rathbones appointee to The City UK Business Council.\n- I am on the Board of the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment and chair the Audit & Risk and Investment Committees.\n- I have previously been a Non-executive Director of the social impact investment company Investing for Good.\nCharity experience\n'A Better City for All' is, with good reason, the slogan of the Lord Mayor’s Appeal Board as it seeks to promote through its pillars of being inclusive, healthy, skilled and fair. It is a sentiment I share wholeheartedly. This year the specific charities being supported by the Lord Mayor’s Appeal Board are National Numeracy, MQ Mental Health and Homewards.\nI also believe that the many churches around the City can often provide a sanctuary in the midst of our busy-ness and are a reminder of the values and ethics that we strive to uphold in the community. Indeed, the Corporation’s motto is Domine Dirige Nos (Lord guide us).\n- I am delighted to be a St Catherine Friend and Churchwarden of St Lawrence Jewry, which plays a central role in the City's life, and I have Chaired the organising committee for the Annual City Prayer Breakfast for eight years.\n- Currently, I am a trustee at the Samuel Wilson Loan Trust, which provides business loans to young entrepreneurs and the Morden College that provides residential care for older people.\n- I am on the Advisory Board of the Centre for Enterprise, Markets and Ethics, Oxford and a trustee of the Templeton Education and Charity Trust.\n- I have previously been a trustee of the Trust for London and was involved in making £10m of grants a year and visiting some of the projects to help the poor and disadvantaged of London. I have previously been a trustee of Mercy Ships UK, which runs the world’s largest non-governmental hospital ships.\nWith Elspeth Hughes-Penney at the church of St. Lawrence Jewry.\nElspeth Hughes-Penney says\n“I was born and brought up in Yorkshire and went on to read law at Nottingham University.\nAfter law school in Chester and completing my training as a solicitor in London, I specialised in corporate finance and corporate law in the investment and insurance company sectors, while also advising on employment law, and subsequently became an associate partner at my firm.\nI took time out to bring up our three children, although continued as an employment law consultant to my firm until our youngest was born. Our older two children now work in the City and the youngest is studying Theology at university.\nI completed the FT Non-Executive Diploma in 2012, with a view to developing a portfolio career. More recently, since qualifying as a Spiritual Director, I have the privilege of providing space for people to reflect upon and deepen their spiritual lives.\nI am a Freeman of the Goldsmiths’ Company and sit on the Advisory Committee of the Sheriffs’ and Recorder’s Fund.\nI have been active in supporting Robert with his civic role in the City. As he seeks election as Aldermanic Sheriff, I am enjoying connecting with prison charities supported by the Sheriffs’ and Recorder’s Fund. I am looking forward to being more actively involved with the Old Bailey and am particularly motivated by the statue of one of my ancestors, the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry, which stands in the Great Hall!”",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_finding-balance-in-the-city-of-london/content_54.html": "24 December 2021\nFinding balance in the City of London\nWhile the big picture when it comes to finance is looking cautiously optimistic, it's important to remember the individuals and personal plights that surround us. However, I also hope that the overarching economic view can provide some sense of encouragement for all as we look to a new year.\nThe last year has been a challenge – individually and collectively. For some, the losses have been cruel, both personally and professionally. All of us know someone who has suffered, whether it’s the loss of a loved one, loss of a business or who has struggled mentally and emotionally against the worry and strain of the pandemic and its implications.\nIt’s important to remember those details when we look at the big picture. However, it is also hoped that the overarching economic view can provide some sense of encouragement for all as we look to a new year. As we close off the books there’s good reason for cautious, collective optimism, at least from an investment perspective.\nDespite the implications of the pandemic and geopolitical concerns, in the 12 months to mid-December, there was a 13.75% return according to MSCI PIMFA Private Investor Balanced Index, which by anybody’s standards is positive. Despite concerns at the start of the pandemic, the efforts of individuals and the collective whole, have meant that so far, the anticipated crash has been circumnavigated.\nJobs and unemployment rates\nWe know that the furlough scheme has done much to protect the income of millions of people, which has allowed for continued spending. It is estimated that during the lifetime of the scheme about 11.6 million jobs were supported.\nWe also know that unemployment rates in the UK went down to 4.2% in the three months to October 2021, the lowest since the three months to June 2020. Although those numbers are still higher than the pre pandemic figures (by 0.3 percentage points), reports also show the number of employees on payroll rose by 257,278 in November, the most on record, and job vacancies hit a new high of 1.22 million.\nInflation and interest rates\nThere are challenges to our daily lives relating to the rise in inflation, which jumped to 5.1% in November when the price of petrol reached a record high. However, to date, interest rates have remained historically low. There was a recent modest increase by the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee of 0.15% to 0.25%, but despite that, borrowing costs remain cheap. We know those are likely to pick up a bit further next year, but forecasts predict that trend will subside in the second half of the year. That said, risks are on the up side.\nTechnology: the next generation\nTechnology continues to be the dominant industry and the City of London remains an ideal environment in which world leaders can thrive.\nLondon’s tech sector has been described as having shown “remarkable resilience” through the Covid pandemic, attracting a record £8.6 billion in investment in 2020, more than any other European country. London Tech Week 2021 (Europe’s largest technology festival), saw 140 tech scale-ups actively considering expansion to the UK, and the UK fintech market generated revenue worth £6.6bn and employed 76,000 people as of the first half of 2020.\nWhen I started working in the City of London, the big industrial bellwethers were the likes of ICI and General Electric. Today Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and so forth, are the new industrial behemoths. The next generation of tech leaders, in the form of quantum computing, is now coming up fast in the outside lane. They will continue the centrality of technology as a driving force in the economy. In some ways, the pandemic has seen the escalation of tech innovation. For example, Facebook recently announced the development of its haptic glove to help you feel things in the metaverse. It is part of the general move towards virtual reality becoming… well, reality.\nOf course, another area of ongoing growth is data. Much of the tech growth potential is inextricably linked to data processing and what that will enable. Statista estimated that the UK marketing data market was valued at 2.68 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, and it was expected to grow to 3.59 billion U.S. dollars in 2021.\nOther interesting stats to come from TheCityUK financial lobby group recently included:\n- The UK’s trade surplus in financial and related professional services is £79.3bn\n- Over 240 active sustainable bonds were listed on the LSE from over 60 issuers in 2020, which have raised around £50bn\n- The LSE had a 4.4% share of global equity market capitalisation and 2% of global equity trading by value\n- UK private equity funds invested £29.5bn, the largest amount in Europe, in 2020\nThe fly in the ointment for these trends continues to largely come from geopolitical challenges, the risks of which are binary in that they either will amount to something, or they won’t. Broadly speaking however, The City of London, finds itself in a fairly balanced position - a tricky thing to achieve in any area of work and life at the best of times.\nWe remain mindful of events that could knock things off track in the short-term, but overall see positive trends as we head into the next quarter. It’s something which, without complacency, we can feel quietly confident about and hopefully enjoy as we take some time to be with loved ones over the holidays.",

My mind then moved on to this evening and I asked God “God, how much is £10m to you?” and God said, “a penny”. I thought that was interesting, and seeing a potential opportunity I asked God, “God, can I have one of your pennies?” And He replied, “Just wait one second!”\nThe City of London Wealth Management Awards (COLWMA) promotes, acknowledges and rewards the quality of service provided by Wealth Managers.\nThe UK wealth management industry is the second largest wealth management centre by market size globally, only fractionally behind Switzerland, and has continued to grow, with a last reported assets of £1.3tn; put another way, equivalent to 58% of the UK’s GDP.\nThe UK offers globally connected capital markets, allowing wealth managers to diversify clients’ portfolios, and top expertise - that we see assembled in this Guildhall tonight, and including strong professional services support.\nAs a fellow wealth manager, it is a pleasure to be here with you, to personally recognise and congratulate you all on the work you do for the 2.4m people across the UK who use wealth managers for investment, retirement and tax planning.\nEach one of the 2.4m people is a valuable individual, and one of the fundamental purposes of wealth management is to deliver good outcomes to those individual clients. This includes providing expertise and achieving economies of scale that allow access to a wide range of assets that would normally be out of reach for individual investors. Using shares, bonds and other assets wealth managers can deliver returns and tax efficient structures that deliver good outcomes over many years, while managing risk and ensuring suitability that allows individuals to invest to achieve their future goals and ambitions; whether that is a new car or kitchen, a much-needed holiday or a well-earned and secure retirement.\nSo I commend the City of London Wealth Manager Awards 2023 to you and all it does to promote, acknowledge and reward excellence in the quality of service in the wealth and investment management industry.\nMay I add my congratulations as the Lord Mayor’s Aldermanic Representative, and the congratulations of the whole City of London Corporation, to all award winners today.\nI hope today’s reception, dinner and awards ceremony has helped you make useful connections, and I wish you all every success in the future.\nI will now handover to Paul, Master of Ceremonies, and invite him to conduct the awards presentation.\nThank you.",

This year because of the COVID restriction, we did not meet together on mass but virtually. We had over 500 different viewing devices, probably representing nearly 1000 participants, access the City Prayer Breakfast. Some joined from their homeworking location or with a church or workplace small-group Covid restrictions permitting. More than ever the verses from Matthew 18:22 “Where two or more are gathered, there I am with them” hold true.\nThis year our theme was “Love Your Neighbour”. The Rt Hon Lord Mayor Alderman William Russell read Mark 12 verses 28-31 to begin the proceedings.\nIn previous years, we often have had an individual from the financial and the professional services sectors speak to us by way of encouragement about how prayer has played a part in their lives.\nThis year mindful of the amazing work that the NHS and care workers are providing we thought it would be appropriate to ask Dr David Randall from St Barts Hospital which is based here in The City to speak to us. He is a doctor specialising in renal medicine who answered the call to serve in the front-line role in hospitals across the Barts Health NHS trust during the coronavirus epidemic.\nHe was followed by Simon Abrams, Director Sustainable Finance, who leads EY’s practice in this area focusing on delivering low carbon transition and positive social outcomes followed sharing his insights into serving as a Christian in the City. He led us to pray for the City, for those of all faiths and for the influence that the City has with the UK and beyond.\nMeryl Ching, Global Operations Manager, Bupa, also spoke and led us in prayer. She co-leads Bupa Christians and is involved with the cross-company group, Angel Court Christians. She celebrated the community which exists among Christians in the City reminding us of the strength of prayer, encouragement and community.\nFinally, Simon Edwards, a former lawyer and now Lead Missioner at The Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics encouraged Christians in the City to be ambassadors for Christ in the workplace, praying for boldness for Christians in the City.\nWe ended with a Gaelic blessing\n“May the road rise up to meet you.\nMay the wind be always at your back.\nMay the sun shine warm upon your face:\nthe rains fall softly on your fields\nand until we meet again,\nmay God hold you in the palm of his hand.\"\nIf you did not have an opportunity to watch the video or would like to watch it again here is a link to allow you to do so.\nIf you would like to make a donation to help us cover our running costs, you can do so by clicking here – whilst we don’t expect donations and want people to pray above everything else, please rest assured what is donated this year will also help us to finance next year’s Annual City Prayer Breakfast as well.\nA selection of the very positive feedback we received is captured below:\nVicky and I very much appreciated being included in the City Prayer Breakfast. Thank you for involving us...

Well done and many thanks to you and your committee colleagues.\nWell done on the City Prayer Breakfast video. I thought it was a marvellous production and a wonderful catalyst and means whereby which to pray for the City of London at such a challenging time as this. So encouraging to know that, as I was praying, so too many others throughout the country were praying together as well in their homes and offices. What a tremendous blessing. Thank you for putting that together so excellently!\nIt was a pleasure to join with you this morning for the Annual City Prayer Breakfast and thank you for the kind invitation.\nIt was both challenging and enlightening to learn from the contributors the work and issues they face in the city, both through the Covid-19 pandemic and also through their professional experiences. I do thank God for you and your fellow colleagues who work and witness through busy times and busy days. I appreciated your comment that nations are reached through their cities and I am praying with you all that your witness will have more than a ripple effect on the city and our nation as a whole.\nI trust you and your family are well and pray that God will continue to bless you in your Christian witness.\nWell done for a super CPB!

  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_individuality-and-community-the-value-of-shared-wisdom/content_13.html": "25 April 2023\nIndividuality and community: the value of shared wisdom\nTo make sure the City of London operates at its best in the coming wisdom age, serving the nation and doing genuine good across the country and beyond, we need to listen to all parts of the society we serve for inspiration and greatest levels of interdependence so that we're not just self-serving or existing in an echo chamber. Inspired in part by Stephen Covey’s, The 8th Habit, I think there’s enormous opportunity for the City going forwards.\n\"Interdependence is a higher value than independence\" is the declaration of the author Stephen R. Covey, reinforced in his book, The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness. It's the sequel to his famous text, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, hypothesising that interdependence is a natural phenomenon while independence is an egoistic approach.\nCovey’s point is that while independence is important, interdependence is more conscious, considerate and ultimately more collectively beneficial, particularly when it comes to economics and society. Put another way, his point is about the value of community and shared, collective wisdom. It's a position I reflect on relative to the City of London Corporation. As the world’s oldest and longest continuous municipal democracy there must be a story of interdependence that we need to remind ourselves of as we seek to nurture its role in serving the nation and making it a force for good in the UK and beyond.\nThe City of London and societal development\nAcross the centuries, many economic and political philosophers have stressed that beliefs are part of the inherited social capital which provides the social framework for the free market.\nIf we look at an illustration of the stages of societal development, we can chart our progression from hunter gatherer, through the agricultural age and the industrial age, into the IT phase that we’re currently in. For the West, it is said the next developmental stage in that timeline is the wisdom age - knowing what is good and what is good to do.\nThere's contradiction to the suggestion that we’re currently in the IT age because while we use technology and it is transforming our lives our practices are rooted in the industrial age – many business processes are still like a factory production line and many of us still come into an office and clock in and out in the same way as you might in a factory. Despite digitisation and our IT tools, we’re not actually giving individuals the freedom to bring the fullness of their gifts and talents to their work or to take responsibility. That can leave people uninspired and organisations only benefitting from perhaps 25% of an individual's capacity and potential because it's constrained by a factory floor operating mentality. When moving into the wisdom phase, we need to recognise and release individual strengths completely and in the round.\nEmpowering the individual whilst serving society\nThis backdrop ties in with Covey's eighth habit, which is \"find your voice and inspire others to find theirs\". The principle is that the leaders we need now and in the future are those who empower and inspire individuals to find their own purpose. Within the context of the modern world, inspiring others correlates with listening to the people around us and doing good. In the context of work, improving individual and teamwork we need to enable people to find success and fulfilment in the workplace. On a micro level, as businesses continue to navigate hybrid working and how that works for them, their companies and their staff, this all presents food for thought.\nThere’s balance to be had here however, French polymath, René Girard, once wrote:\n\"The mystery is that societies that usually react to a certain danger by attempting to evade it should suddenly reverse their tactics, particularly when the danger seems acute, and take up the opposite strategy, the one that ought to terrify them the most. Whatever the answer, it is really impossible to imagine that the cradle of human cultures was once watched over, as by the legendary good fairy, by a distinguished group of ethnopsychiatrists, who, in their infinite wisdom, endowed these cultures with ritual practices and institutions.\"\nIn short, societies that don't draw on historic received wisdom as a reference point for what good looks like today are on a problematic trajectory. Received historic wisdom is the product of millennia of refinement and if we can't look at that and build again in our own strengths, then we're in trouble.\nWe live in a world of highly prized individualism, and that's important, but we live in community and to move forwards we have to do so collectively. So, the saying goes - \"If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together.\"\nBeyond the echo chamber\nThe City of London has, and is, a force for good in the UK, and while it might often be seen as a place for the privileged few to exist in their glass towers, it is largely acknowledged at least as the UK's financial centre and a major contributor to the overarching economy. Indeed, the concentration of interrelated financial and professional services businesses and people is testimony to the strength of the interdependence model. My experience of The City and the people in it, however, is that there is so much more good being done that is less communicated beyond the Square Mile. In addition, there is more still that can be done for the greater collective good going forward.\nIf we are to expand upon the good that the community here can do, particularly now with the aid of digitisation, I think there is (as is so often the case) the need for self-reflection. We have to ask ourselves if we are prepared to humble ourselves and take a 360-degree review, in the business vernacular, so that we're not just self-serving or existing in an echo chamber. We do not have a monopoly on wisdom - just as in a Board room you need a number of different voices, points of view and experience contexts to receive the benefit of different points of view, those nuances are essential to the growing wisdom and next phase of success for society and the economy. Much as healthcare is rarely as straightforward as taking a tablet to fix a problem or improve wellbeing, we are growing wise enough as a nation to know that a more holistic approach is necessary to get to where we want to go – also understanding that it’s a constant work in progress.\nIn the City, we need to make sure that we're going out and listening to what the nation, international business leaders, the third sector/faith communities, the world of the arts and the population at large needs and wants us to do, so that we can best serve the people up and down the country. We need to identify their position and values as well as our own, so that we can create a far healthier, more positive and dare I say wise, legacy in nations, markets and society moving forwards. By drawing on this wider network of ideas and input, we can achieve greater interdependence and even greater benefits for humanity as we move into the next age.",

Of course that has a double meaning in this context, because for those of us that have been here before it is indeed lovely to be back, but for the charity this is especially significant because it always was the case that the Lord Mayor and lady mayoress as the residents graciously allowed the charity to host an annual event here, which in recent years has lapsed – so it is lovely to see the charity back at Mansion House in the heart of the City for this reception.\nIn December I had the privilege to visit one of LCMs Day Centre projects at Webber Street, in Southwark, just a mile from where we are standing this evening. The Webber Street centre has for over 60 years been providing people who are homeless vital life-giving care, including cooked breakfast, hot drinks, access to clean showers, clean clothes and toiletries, help with form filling and access to help and other services. On the day I was there were also visits from two NHS mobile care services providing check-ups and care that visitors might not otherwise access.\nThe centre also has activities such as an art club, a board games club and a bible reading club. Whilst there I had the chance to chat with a few of the visitors and as is so often the case one is reminded that there is no them and us; some visitors are very well educated, some less so, there’s a range of career and work experiences and a range of family life experiences. Some visit regularly, some occasionally, some live on the streets close by, others come from far afield. I am sure there are some aspects of each visitor’s life that you and I would be able to identify with.\nSo, besides giving that vital life-giving care, on another level the centre provides humanity; many if not all of us have places we go, clubs, societies, activities where we go, that we know and are known, to be, to be ourselves, to relax refresh and recharge. And that is exactly what I saw at Webber Street; a place for those whose home is on the street, that don’t have access to a club or society, but somewhere they can go and just be. What a precious gift that is.\nI also visited The Corner House, situated in the same building, which wonderfully provides accommodation and deep pastoral care for up to six months at a time for five men who are stepping out of homelessness.\nIn some ways, it might seem incongruous to be here in the Ballroom of Mansion House talking about homelessness, and in some ways, of course it is, but I do think that it is good and right to celebrate and dare I say dance about, the amazing work that London City Mission is doing, and has been doing for 188 years, and in very practical ways showing the love of Jesus to those who are marginalised, living in the shadow of the City.\nThe Epistle of James reminds us that “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after the orphans and widows in their distress.” And I want to thank and honour London City Mission as they live this reality out.\nThank you",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_justice-for-survivors-how-can-the-city-serve-the-nation/content_17.html": "11 March 2025\nJustice for survivors: How can The City serve the nation?\nLeading on from my thoughts on justice for the accused, I have endeavoured to put down my thoughts on the incredibly complicated matter of justice for survivors. I have always said that The City is a unique community, and while it is not responsible for the laws of the land, it can leverage its influence to create a more just society. I would be grateful for your thoughts.\nThe topic of justice for survivors is especially emotive, with crime leaving so many victims in its wake. Nonetheless, I think we all seek to live in a world where survivors receive justice - but what exactly does that mean?\nOur news feeds are strewn with daily reminders of growing levels of violence. There are those that make headlines, like the heartbreaking Southport murders, and those that almost seem to be dehumanised in a raft of statistics, like the swell of violence against women, which is at such a level as to have been described as a ‘national emergency’ by the National Police Chiefs’ Council.\nThis is compounded by what appears to be cries for help from all directions, as our proud and sophisticated, internationally respected judicial system heaves under the strain of bottlenecks at various different junctures. For example, last year The Guardian reported that \"more than 180 alleged rape victims have faced more than two years of delays since case first went to court\". In some cases this is as long as five years according to an article in the Financial Times.\nThe challenges of logistics aside, it all ultimately leads to both greater suffering and the appearance of a system that's becoming ineffectual.\nWhen it comes to crime, the law largely exists to provide a framework for expected behaviours and a deterrent against unwanted ones, as well as to give protocols for the pursuit of justice after a crime has been committed. One also hopes that the system seeks to do this in a way that comforts survivors where possible, minimises further anguish through the necessities of the legal process, and hopefully offers some absolution.\nThe law at its best can also help prevent further crime from happening. However, this is a space in which the wider community, particularly those in positions of economic power, such as businesses within The City, can help.\nThe City's contribution to justice\nAs individuals we are limited in our influence, but I have long believed in the power of community. I am particularly passionate about the importance of family as a building block for society and protection against crime. I also believe communities can come together to move the dial, even if it's only by an inch, because if we all do a little, much can be achieved.\nThe City of London is a unique community, with influence both locally and nationally. In my professional life the knowledge that the actions I take have an impact on individuals and their lives across the country has been a powerful motivator. What we do within our financial institutions has an impact on someone who is saving for a well-earned retirement, a holiday, a new car, or to manage the rising costs of living. I have always believed the City is here to serve the nation.\nThat influence also imbues us all with responsibility. With its specific shape and community of businesses, the City is able to play a part in driving justice for survivors of crime. For example, In 2010, I created and chaired what is now the Rathbones Stewardship Committee, which has engaged in issues including modern-day slavery and seeks to put investor power behind key ESG issues, including transparent supply chains.\nThe issue of modern slavery and human trafficking is a persistent concern. In a report, Rathbones wrote: \"Fifty million people are trapped in what’s known as 'modern slavery’. This includes 28 million in forced labour and 22 million in forced marriages, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), a United Nations agency.\"\nWhile Section 54 of the 2015 Modern Slavery Act made it necessary for companies to publish a statement to ensure modern slavery isn't within their supply chain, with insufficient enforcement powers within the Home Office, the onus is on businesses to be proactive.\nRathbones writes: \"Investors have a crucial role in stepping into this vacuum of enforcement. First we enjoyed some success in doing this on our own. But since 2020 Rathbones has organised an investor coalition to challenge FTSE 350 companies that have failed to abide by s54.\"\nThis coalition was called ‘Votes Against Slavery’ and is renewed each year with new companies on its target list. It \"calls on members to use their strongest power of censure if companies don’t comply with s54: the stewardship tactic of voting against the annual report and accounts. If these are rejected, the board is legally obliged to make changes and put forward a new report for a fresh vote.\"\nI believe that using the architecture of the City to help minimise and prevent injustice is one of the most powerful ways we can contribute to society, not just ethically, but economically as well, not to mention taking pressure off the justice system to better handle those circumstances that have already occurred.\nThere are other initiatives as well that quietly but effectively exert pressure on the system to do better. For example, The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) leads global action to tackle money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing. Their research into how money is laundered and terrorism is funded promotes global standards to mitigate the risks, and assesses whether countries are taking effective action.\nPart of their work includes reporting financial information to help identify human trafficking for sexual exploitation or forced labour. There are further proposals for additional filters to be applied in a similar way to fines for failures around data compliance.\nThe fines around modern day slavery are minimal compared to those around data compliance, and while it's important to protect data, it's even more important to protect people in my opinion. It may be that it's easier to track data than supply chains, but in this day and age it strikes me that we can do better. The fine regime ought to be at least equivalent to that relating to data, but to the best of my knowledge there isn't a corresponding multiplier to the one used in data compliance. These are just examples - I think there are more economic angles that could be levied in this space.\nHow the third sector is addressing judicial complexity\nI have also been privileged to meet and engage with a number of people who are doing an excellent job of working with survivors in different, and often complex spaces, through charitable organisations. Amongst them are the Howard League, which is the oldest penal reform organisation in the world; Justice and Care, who are committed to ending modern slavery; and Hope for Justice, who help victims and survivors of modern slavery globally. What’s apparent through their tireless work is not only the scale of the problem relating to modern day slavery in particular, but also how the definition of a ‘survivor’ isn’t always straightforward or even necessarily that sympathetic.\nA friend of mine, David Westlake, is the CEO of the International Justice Mission. I recently attended one of their events, where they brought home the real scope of what modern day slavery can mean. We often think of it in the context of sweatshops or sex workers, but they were telling stories of call centres in South East Asia where workers were pressured into honey trapping vulnerable elderly men on the phone to extract money. There is something about that uninvited preying on victims by invading the sanctity of their home that's particularly unpleasant, and of course exposes victims both in the context of the workers in that factory as well as those at the end of the deceit.\nMeanwhile, The Howard League recently made a successful application for a child trafficking victim’s conviction to be appealed. A boy who pleaded guilty to charges while a victim of child trafficking could have his conviction overturned after the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). Having explained to his solicitor when he was arrested that he had been coerced into committing drug offences, it raised police concerns that he was involved in ‘county lines’ criminal exploitation. However, having not been given appropriate legal advice, he assumed he had no defence and made an unequivocal guilty plea in the youth court resulting in an 18-month detention and training order. Having contacted the Howard League legal team while in prison, his case is now under review.\nAndrea Coomber KC (Hon.), Chief Executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “If this decision by the CCRC leads to an acquittal, it will address a terrible miscarriage of justice. It will also help a young man to move on with his life without being held back by a criminal record\".\nWhile convicting people of crimes that are detrimental to society is essential, it is important to convict the correct people and to identify where individuals have been victims themselves. This is the complexity of society and we can only be grateful for the work of institutions like the Howard League, who give a voice to those who don't have one.\nA space in which we can do better\nUltimately, when we talk about the survivors of injustice, it's a complex area. Yes, it's about the obvious victims of crime, but it can also be about those caught up in it. While that isn't an argument for a lack of accountability, it is an argument for focusing on what we want to achieve from our justice system.\nI have written before about our prisons, the number of prisoners held on remand, and the challenges that poses. It does not serve society not to hand down justice, but it also does not serve to get it wrong. Our methods must be underpinned by human compassion, and while punishment is an inevitable necessity, our goal must be prevention, protection, and rehabilitation wherever humanly possible.\nThe City cannot be held responsible for all of that, but I do think it can play an essential part - and a greater part than it currently is - in improving the status quo. That’s an incredible opportunity and indeed a great honour to have.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_the-city-of-london-s-commitment-to-charity/content_19.html": "07 December 2020\nThe City of London’s Commitment to Charity\nAs we enter the Christmas period, and with it the season of thinking of others, generosity and making gifts, I would like to reflect on some of the charitable activities undertaken in the City.\nOne of the impacts of the global pandemic this year has been the pronounced rise in the number of people struggling with the cost of living. In March alone, one million people made new claims for Universal Credit, which is 700% higher than the monthly average1. WPI Economics also report widening inequality – the rate of unemployment benefits claims from the most deprived 10% of London neighbourhoods has increased 2.5 times faster than in the least deprived 10%2 since March. This makes for hard reading, but also poses an important challenge to the City of London and its tenants: what can we do about it?\nWhile the City is known for its powerful generation of business, what often gets forgotten is the rich history of charitable activity in many of its institutions, that continues today. Forerun by the parochial charities of the traditional 112 parishes in the ‘Square Mile’3, charity work in the City proliferated into numerous companies and trusts that have allocated funds to serve the poorest and the most vulnerable in the capital. These include the 110 Livery Companies, who, from their creation, demonstrated an exemplary commitment to care for their members in sickness and old age. In recent times, they have greatly expanded their charitable aims and grant-making, to the tune of £40m per year4. Two other modern charitable leaders in the City are ‘Trust for London’ (formerly ‘The Trustees of the London Parochial Charities’) and ‘City Bridge Trust’ (formerly ‘The Bridge House Estates’) which was released from its strict bridge-building mandate in 1995, permitting it to use surpluses for wider purposes in Greater London. ‘City Bridge Trust’ is now London’s biggest independent grant giver, making charitable grants of £25m a year to tackle disadvantage across the city5.\nEarlier in my career, I had the privilege of being involved with both trusts, and I have also served on Charity Committee at the Haberdashers’ Livery Company. From this time, I have witnessed the great influence the City has on communities when it channels its financial muscle towards supporting effective charities and promising targeted local initiatives.\nThe annual sum of £35m granted by the two Trusts is dispersed to a plethora of causes, spanning decent living standards and community buildings, to the amplification of under-represented or marginalised voices. However, underlying every provision of finance is a commitment to high-impact solutions which target the root causes of poverty and inequality, based on sound data. To this end, the Trusts have invested heavily in research and expertise. For example, Trust for London invested in the redevelopment of the ‘London Poverty Profile’, the UK’s first independent assessment of poverty6, to inform borough-specific, targeted strategies.\nBharat Mehta CBE, Chief Executive at Trust for London: “While we want to be the life-raft for those in difficulty, we also want to be assessing the root causes of those difficulties”.7\nThe Trusts also allocate substantial funds to strategic advice and durable support. Trust for London allocated 42% of their 2019 grants towards these ends8, while City Bridge Trust invests in services that work to relieve people from heavy legal or financial burdens and crippling first obstacles.\nThere is also a healthy emphasis on self-sustainability in much of the trusts’ funding. For example, City Bridge Trust has a ‘Stepping Stones Fund’, which seeks to provide grants or risk finance to test out the viability of different business propositions. This fund has been awarded over £3 million since 2014 and was the winner of the 2018 Charity Times Award for best “Social Investment Initiative”9. Likewise, Trust for London make an appeal to organisations seeking investment “to help them develop sustainable work with positive outcomes for society.10” A thriving case study is The Foundry building at Vauxhall – a venue of office, meeting, and conference space for social justice and human rights organisations – which received finance from Trust for London and Rathbones.\nBharat Mehta CBE: “Bought for £12m in 2015, the market price of ‘The Foundry’ is now £17m, offering us a good return for future grant-making activity.”11\nIt is pleasing to see that these charitable institutions have answered the heightened call to action during the pandemic. At times, this has involved a hike in donations: notably, £1 million donations by City Bridge Trust and Trust for London to the London Community Response Fund, which offers financial support for civil society groups. Additionally, the Haberdashers’ Benevolent Fund matched any charitable donations made by Haberdasher members between March 23rdand June 1st. The result was a £25,226 donation, contributing to the total of £59,000 (including gift aid) spread across 38 charities12. At other times, it has involved the rekindling of a pan-livery collective spirit. Just one example of this is the NHS Livery Kitchens Initiative, which involves the Merchant Taylors’ Company, the Drapers’ and Grocers’ Companies joining forces to provide around 500-600 meals a day to the staff at Barts Health Trust hospitals13.\nAnother significant recent contribution made by the City’s charitable funds is the projection of their voices to defend the vulnerable. Following a letter written to Secretary of State Robert Jenrick in June by a coalition involving City Bridge Trust and Trust for London, which appealed for an eviction ban, the government increased notice periods to six months – a move which should keep many from becoming homeless this winter. Advocacy work is multiplying, with the Trust for London also funding a new Commission seeking to produce a White Paper setting out a better way to deliver social security in the UK that is more sensitive to the everyday demands of recipients14.\nOn a personal note, last month I became a trustee at Clergy Support Trust. Clergy Support Trust is the UK’s largest and oldest clergy support charity, whose purpose is to promote, sustain and renew the wellbeing of Anglican clergy, whether serving or retired, and their family members. The Clergy do some amazing work in the City and across the wider country, providing emotional and practical support to thousands of people in their congregations, and by extension, thousands more in the parish communities who benefit from church members’ commitment to care for their neighbour.\nHowever, to flourish in their roles as leaders and meet the high demands of the job, the clergy must have adequate resources and support. That is why the Trust gave out grants amounting to £3.1m to clergy and their family members last year, £1.9m of which went to addressing situations where the clergy stipend was insufficient to cover the family’s outgoings. Yet there is still much more to do with financial difficulty and psychological stress remaining at excessive levels15. Therefore, I am excited to partner with the trustees in their aim to double the number of beneficiaries from 2018 and build a wider partnership base for the future.\nI hope that the recent charitable work of the City encourages you to give generously to those less fortunate this Christmas. In a time when the wounded third sector is struggling to meet the unprecedented need brought on by Covid-19, our generosity and donations have perhaps never been more important.\n1 Resolution Foundation, No Work, No Pay.

  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_advancing-uk-as-a-hub-for-sustainable-investments/content_68.html": "14 November 2024\nAdvancing UK as a Hub for Sustainable Investments\nRobert Hughes-Penney addresses the role of private equity and venture capital in growing the UK’s impact investment market.\nGood morning,\nIt is my great pleasure to welcome you to this morning’s investor reception for our Finance for Impact programme.\nLooking around the room there are many friends and familiar faces, but for those I’ve not met I am Robert Hughes-Penney, one of the elected Aldermen of the City of London, and a Board member of the Impact Investing Institute for the last four years, prior to which I was on the Board of Investing for Good for four years.\nIn the more than 30 years since I started work in the City, I have long held to belief that capitalism and markets are not about piling pound coins on top of one another; make a profit for sure, but importantly they are about the flourishing of humanity in the round.\nAnd the aim of this morning is a great example of that; the noble purpose of business; giving people purpose and helping move capital towards impactful investments. I very much hope and expect that this will be a dynamic space to foster meaningful relationships between Limited Partner and General Partners to help direct capital towards impact-focused venture funds.\nOf course, none of this would be possible without our hosts and supporters; Rothschild Wealth Management, Impact VC and Uplink. Your support is much appreciated.\nThis is the final event in our series on the role that private equity and venture capital can play in driving the growth of the impact investing sector as part of the City of London Corporation Finance for Impact initiative, which aims to establish the UK as a hub for sustainable finance, and scale finance for social outcomes, and has been done in collaboration with the Impact Investing Institute, British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (BVCA), Impact VC and Better Society Capital, to whom many thanks\nSo, what a better way to conclude the series than by convening investors on COP29’s finance day\nA few comments before I hand over to the experts\nThe UK impact investment market has shown remarkable growth. According to the newest research the market was £76.8 billion by the end of 2023, with a strong 10.1% compound annual growth rate (2020-2023). This is particularly impressive given the flat lining of broader UK assets.\nPrivate equity and venture capital are described as being \"at the heart\" of impact investing in the UK, providing the platform for broadening what impact investing can achieve. You are all among the leading impact investors in the market today, alongside social investors and foundations.\nThe performance data from the Institute’s research is compelling: 68% of UK impact investors reported financial returns that outperformed expectations, while an impressive 88% reported impact performance exceeding their targets. This demonstrates that impact investing can deliver both financial returns and meaningful social/environmental outcomes.\nThe UK stands out as a true centre of excellence through its comprehensive ecosystem: bringing together academics, a policy framework supporting both capital supply and demand, and a history of market development dating back to 2000. The UK represents approximately 8% of the global impact investment market, making it one of the most established markets alongside the US.\nThere have been promising steps forward from the UK government and regulators, signalling interest in harnessing the power of impact investing to catalyse action on its missions, including announcing a landmark move in the development of a Social Impact Investment Vehicle in the latest Budget, and I look forward to the Chancellor’s speech in Mansion House tonight.\nSo, there is an opportunity now for a global leader to build the next stage of the impact investing ecosystem and display what good can and does look like. As a sector, the value of impact investing is well understood, especially as a tool for catalysing positive solutions to societal challenges.\nSo, we are called upon to embrace the transformative opportunities arising from what has been described as a “megatrend” in investment, with a 2029 of $1trn possible – as someone once said, “the harvest is vast”!\nSo, in conclusion, we need to scale these efforts, share best practice, and ensure it remains a high integrity market, delivering tangible positive outcomes. The UK has the potential to build on its strong foundations in impact investing to drive such scaling efforts globally, and you can be part of that collective effort.\nI wish you a stimulating, inspiring and encouraging morning.\nThank you,\nRobert Hughes-Penney",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_livery-education-conference/content_61.html": "21 November 2023\nLivery Education Conference\nAlderman Robert Hughes-Penney passionately addresses the 10th Livery Education Conference, highlighting the diverse history of education, emphasising the need for well-rounded character development alongside academic learning, and expressing gratitude to the City's livery companies for their enduring support in shaping generations of young minds.\nTues 21st November\nMaster, Chairman, honoured guests, it is my huge pleasure to be with you today at this important conference, the 10th Livery Education Conference. The UK, and the world, is changing fast, and equipping young people with the skills they need for the future job market has never been more important.\nThe Lord Mayor and Sheriffs have asked me to pass on their apologies, their thanks to the Livery Schools Link for arranging the conference, and good wishes for a successful and stimulating time. Sadly, they cannot be here today due to the busyness of their diaries and prior commitments.\nFor those who don’t know me, I’m Alderman Robert Hughes-Penney.\nI am also the product of the Livery schools system. So, maybe it is appropriate that the civic diaries worked like this and that I am able to be with you today. I had the privilege of attending Haberdashers’ Boys School. A school founded in 1690 by a wealthy benefactor which for many years was a direct grant school before moving into the independent sector in the 1970s.\nMaster, Merchant Taylors were just down the road from us, and I can share with fellow guests that the sporting rivalry was a fierce, as any medieval meeting of the guilds on Cheapside.\nNow the City is very proud of its own schools, comprising independent, co-sponsored and sole sponsored academies, and those it is associated with through Livery associations, many of which are represented here today.\nThe Corporation’s Education Strategy includes Leaders, teachers and all learners in the City Family of Schools, as well as the Adult Skills and Education Service, and Apprenticeships Scheme, not to mention the Culture Mile and Culture Mile Learning Partners.\nIndeed, in his speech at the Banquet last week the Lord Mayor referenced the City being home to 40 learned societies, 70 higher education institutions and 130 research institutes. And he reminded us that the so-called coffee house “penny universities” evolved into the London Stock Exchange and Lloyd’s of London. So, we see even then the link between education and the business aspects of the City.\nBut I stand before you as an Alderman of the City with 30 years’ experience in the investment world. And so I hesitate to speak before this experienced audience on the subject of education.\nBut what is education? Albert Einstein famously said that “Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.” To which I would respond; Yes but…\nEducation draws inspiration from The Gymnasium. Alexander the Great needs little introduction. Whilst often remembered as an effective military leader his education was hardly limited to military arts. He and a group of friends were tutored in literature, philosophy and science by Aristotle. From the earliest beginnings of Greek education, in the cave of philosopher Pythagoras, the search for wisdom and understanding was undertaken in small communities.\nLater periods saw the emergence of The Monastery, where life was defined by a continuous direction of the mind to a single transcendent purpose. In short it was a life of concentrated attention. Hildegard of Bingen emerged from this period, and she had great political and moral influence in the time.\nThe flowering of the monastic culture gave birth the universities - with the Latin roots of the word “university” meaning both “whole” and “community”. And the Victorian polymath John Henry Newman’s vision was for the whole, in which individuals developed and found their place in a larger intellectual community.\nBut the university route isn’t the only way. The emergence of the craft Guilds were not just economic but also educational institutions. I barely need to remind this audience of the creative and productive power of the guilds and liveries. And while there were significant variations among the liveries the standard method of training was the apprenticeship, typically lasting four to six years. In addition to education the liveries also provided regulation and community – a rich legacy that should continue to inform our current attempts to create more organic forms of training for a wide variety of professions.\nAnd I want to honour the City’s livery companies who have supported and educated generation after generation of young people in the City and beyond.\nHistory offers an inspiring list of individuals who accomplished great things without a university degree; Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Bach, our late Queen, Jane Austen, Alfred Tennyson, Thomas Edison, Coco Chanel and of course Steve Jobs.\nThe educational background of these individuals should liberate our thinking about what is possible for the realisation of human potential today and the numerous routes individuals can take to make a positive contribution to the life of this great City.\nIndeed, we in the City are in desperate need for well-educated individuals. Many business leaders I talk to regularly speak of the war for talent, both domestically and internationally. And we must communicate that individuals are welcome into the City either via the school/university route or the increasingly popular apprenticeship route whatever the background. As well as the well-publicised diversity criteria we seek cognitive diversity, talent, commitment and aptitude wherever it shines.\nYet our tendency is often to think of “certificate or grade acquisition” as distinct from the more holistic work of self-formation. Yes, we must learn Maths, and let’s ensure it is usable and applicable maths, or IT skills, but let’s do so in a view of education, in some sense character education, that comprises honesty, gratitude, humility and restraint. Ethics and philosophy are going to be vital as we contend with future technological developments and AI. Some may have read Stephen Covey’s 8th habit from Effectiveness to Greatness in which he posits that the 5th age of civilisation, after knowledge and technology, is Wisdom.\nWilliam Burroughs famously said “The aim of education is the knowledge, not of facts, but of values.”\nThese characteristics, honesty, gratitude, humility and restraint; the product of an education of the whole person, all remain vital underpins for any individual taking their place here in the City of London. Let us be clear that with virtues such as these individuals will make, cannot fail to make, a constructive contribution to their family, their community and their workplace.\nI do not believe we can be or should be prescriptive about the education routes that individuals take or be narrow in defining what good looks like. We need to equip and train with the very best methods available for the individual student so that they are equipped and released into the City workforce, ready and able to play their part and make their contribution. We have all heard the quote “Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.” This remains as true today as it ever was.\nThis gathering is an important forum, look around this Hall and ponder, the individuals here are responsible for and influencing the lives of tens of thousands of young people.\nIt is a vital and significant role for which we are gathered, whether you call it a domino or butterfly effect, the thoughts, conversations and actions arising out of this gathering can have a huge influence in the lives of individuals and our communities, and the City. And on behalf of the City and the Lord Mayor can I thank you for your commitment to education.\nI wish you a very good, stimulating, and productive day. Thank you",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_message-from-the-alderman-of-the-ward-of-cheap/content_51.html": "25 March 2020\nMessage from the Alderman of the Ward of Cheap\nRecent weeks, and in particular the events of last week, have understandably caused high levels of anxiety. Firstly, for the health and wellbeing of our friends and loved ones, and also because of the impact coronavirus is having on businesses and jobs in the City and across the UK.\nNaturally, we all have questions, and having worked with my colleagues to try to find some tangible answers for everyone within the Ward of Cheap, I wanted to draw attention to what is being done, where you can find support and the possible pathways ahead.\nI feel it’s important to emphasise, that while there are undoubtedly difficult times ahead, we have all been through difficult times before and we have many reasons to be quietly confident in our collective abilities to pull through. This I believe wholeheartedly, and will be doing everything within my power to facilitate.\nWe have good reason to look to the future\nIn a joint statement by the Lord Mayor and Policy Chair last week, William Russell and Catherine McGuinness offered reassurance to all living and working in The City, saying:\n“We will be supporting the City, to help employees, businesses and the financial system. We will be sustaining our work on long-term competitiveness, for example by continuing our climate action work. And we will be speeding the recovery so we are ready, whenever the moment comes, to relaunch a full and strong economy.”\nTogether, they reminded us of the strengths that are the foundations of The City’s proudest strengths and achievements. Foundations that we often forget the real value of in times of affluence, but which really do offer a supportive base on which we are able to hold fast when things get tough. They said: “London will always be one of the world’s leading financial centres, a city of global talent with a highly-skilled workforce and more international HQs than any other European city.”\nIt is for those reasons we can be optimistic amidst the caution and careful thought about how we manage the current situation and work towards recovery in the not too distant future.\nThere is support available and to come for businesses and organisations of all sizes\nUnderstandably, many have contacted both myself and colleagues at Guildhall, looking for answers and a sense of direction. Of course, information and advice is being updated regularly, in line with the situation and Government responses. However, you may be reassured that action is most certainly being taken to keep business in The City running, albeit remotely, and that the challenges of organisations of all sizes, and the people within them, are being taken into careful consideration.\nIt is in our collective interest for us all to be cared for. In an environment used to high levels of competition, this is certainly a situation where care for all is paramount. For example, in terms of support for hard-hit industries throughout the City of London and the UK, particularly SMEs, the Chamberlain’s Department and The City Bridge Trust are looking into this.\nAdditionally, The City Bridge Trust is looking into what support may be provided for charities and third sector organisations with the help of Philanthropy Director, Fiona Rawes. They have already pledged an initial £1,000,000, as advised by Alderman Gowman (Vice-Chair of CBT) on Tuesday last week.\nThere are also measures in place to look into setting up a virtual engagement programme focused on key markets and sectors in London. This was already underway anyway in light of Brexit, and now has even more reason to be expedited. Where visits overseas were planned, communications will continue, but in a virtual capacity instead.\nStaying connected as more information comes to light\nNaturally, there will be more information to come imminently, but the main message is clear. Business will continue, both short and long term. There is and will be support available, and if you have questions, I myself am available to constituents in the Ward of Cheap, and my colleagues at Guildhall are also available to support and advise wherever possible.\nIn addition the local church ministers, Rev David Parrott at St Lawrence Jewry and Rev Paul Kennedy at St. Vedast, are both available to talk and pray with members of the community. Rev Paul reminds us that:\n“in Sunday’s Gospel reading Jesus spits on the earth, makes paste and rubs it in the eyes of a blind man, this restoring his sight. No social distancing and not a sanitiser in sight. We are social animals: touch, embrace, shared wine, the Mothers’ Day meal form our natural rhythm. The journey of faith transfers the centre of attention away from ourselves to the Other; whether that Other is neighbour, rough sleeper or God. This virus changes everything as we isolate. Like many in business, I wrote letters telling people not to come into work afraid for the hopes, dreams and rents of these young Londoners. We’re aware of illness and human frailty but “I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels or demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord”. At St. Vedast we offer mass most days and are asked to pray for the ill, the fearful, NHS staff, students missing exams.\nPanic buying hits the news but my experience has been of kindness and compassion. The friendly enquiry about how I really feel. Mothering Sunday traditionally starts with the word, “rejoice” and the encouragement “be joyful all who were mourning”. This will come.”\nIf you would like to contact me or the Common Councillors, please do so and we will endeavour to answer questions wherever we can.\nWishing you good health.\nRobert Hughes-Penney",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_now-is-the-time-for-leadership-and-progress/content_58.html": "20 October 2020\nNow is the time for leadership and progress\nOver the course of the last eight months we have relied heavily on the use of digital communications. In many ways we have probably leapt forward in a matter of weeks what would otherwise have taken years, and in many places, this has been very effective. However, the way we have been operating cannot be a complete or a permanent alternative to the economic, social and infrastructural value of the traditional way we do business in the UK and its economic heartland, The City of London.\nProactively moving into a new phase\nIn July, I wrote about the extraordinary resilience shown by The City of London this year. I spoke of a time for patience as we learned about Covid-19 and did our civic duty by staying at home in order to help flatten the curve. The best part of a year on however, and we need to start planning for the future, remembering we are created as social beings, albeit living in a digital and agile world.\nIt a phase that the Government was clearly trying to action, but understandably has had to dial down given the emergence of a second wave. The anxiety is perhaps caused not just by the obvious fears for peoples’ physical health and wellbeing, but neuroses around public opinion and media backlash. I read, with interest, Luke Johnson’s article in the Sunday Times in September, titled ‘Past generations would have toughed this out’, where he cited the UK’s reaction to the Hong Kong influenza epidemic of 1968-9 as a preferable benchmark for how we could have, collectively, responded differently to Covid-19. Of course, as science has progressed so has our ability to respond in a more effective manner than ‘letting it rip’ so to speak.\nWhile his opinion is as valid as anyone’s, we can only operate in our own time and respond to the challenges, state of mind, advantages and disadvantages that we currently have at our disposal. Despite criticisms, the British people and its businesses have shown phenomenal stoicism this year, and it has been an important period of learning and understanding for the situation we are in. However, we are not in the same position we were in in March.\nThe importance of social interaction for the City of London\nWe now know more about Covid-19 – how it spreads, how it affects people, who it affects the most and how to treat it. We need to balance the risks of Covid-19 with the potential destruction to society and the economy by peoples’ inability to interact. We are, at our core, social beings. We are relational creatures whose society and infrastructure is built on meeting people. Our great trading nation is founded on the Stock Exchange which started life in The City’s coffee shops, while the likes of Lloyd's was founded at a coffee house on Tower Street in 1686. And in this day and age is it a surprise that the way people seek to connect is described as social media.\nOf course, we need to take Covid-secure measures. Of course, we need to behave practically, responsibly and with care for those around us. However, we also need to act in the interests of our current and future generations. We are intelligent beings. We know how to act to look after ourselves and our loved ones and I trust we encourage each other to act responsibly for the strangers around us as well for the benefit of community.\nNow is a time for leadership\nHowever, we also need to protect the interests of future generations. Their progress is being decimated by limited access to education, to mentoring and by the loss of jobs, none more so than in The City of London, which plays a critical part in the UK economy. That is not to mention the mental health impact that isolation and job losses have on us both individually and collectively.\nIt is not a question of simply returning to what we had before; the physicality of the Square Mile and clustered proximity of world leading professional services is important. It is where leading businesses from around the world have gone historically and continue to go, with confidence in the quality of services underpinned by the legal system, in order access other leading organisations to generate and cultivate ideas and solutions born of interaction, communication and socialisation. However, we need to move forward in the current situation, not stay frozen in time. To do so requires a rethink of the Square Mile which at its most basic is the concept of a Central Business District and how this straddles the physical proximity and the digital virtual ether.\nRetaining our community and business community integrity\nWe need to look at creating more of an online community rather than simply having meetings online. The real and virtual worlds need to coexist and complement one another, bringing together the inspiration and camaraderie of the Square Mile, but with the agile flexibility on the digital realm, as we have glimpsed this year.\nAround three-quarters of British businesses currently say they will keep increased homeworking in place after coronavirus has been suppressed, according to a survey run by the Institute of Directors, a UK business organisation. However, that does not make urban centres less relevant, and it does not lessen the value of a ‘City’ address when it comes to representing a business with firm foundations and trust that clients can depend on. It means changing how and when we use those physical spaces in order to add value.\nFor example, it may be that more people travel into cities than before the pandemic, but with less frequency. The in-person interactions may be higher value for businesses than the day-to-day ones we have been used to in the past. Perhaps the nuts and bolts of daily work are done remotely while team building, training, mentoring and meetings are more about establishing a personal connection with colleagues and clients.\nAn opportunity to think differently\nCities around the world are already beginning to shape themselves for this ‘new normal’. An article in the Financial Times highlighted that Paris is championing the concept of the “15-minute city”, where living spaces are a short commute from work and amenities; Melbourne is proposing “20-minute neighbourhoods”; and Montreal is working on defining a hybrid system that combines remote working and the continued use of physical space.\nIn creating these new and dynamic ways of working we can seek to retain the convivial buzz that we know and love in London and in The City in particular, but work more efficiently, safely and perhaps even allow for healthier lifestyles and a better work/life balance. It could be a chance to make The City even greener. In London as a whole we are already looking at measures to improve the city experience with additional bike lanes, better hygiene on public transport, such as contactless fare payments, and encouraging low-emission transport options, such as electric vehicles and scooters.\nAchieving these changes, and more, takes leadership, and there is none better to lead than The City of London as demonstrated by this recent announcement from the recently report entitled London Recharged: Our vision for London in 2025. It is what we have always done, it is what we do best, and it is what we must continue to do.",

By thinking about it that way, I think we do our jobs better, more compassionately, we serve the community as a whole, and we remain focused on the higher purpose of everything we do.\nIt is increasingly and abundantly clear that we are living in a state of flux, but while moving towards the future, we are grounded by our inherent values, which we can depend upon to help chart choppy seas.\nSo much of our cultural heritage influences our values today. We see it in America, for example - a 250 year old nation, born of the Founding Fathers, The Mayflower and Calvinist doctrine. That heritage is very much about the individual and can arguably be linked to their characteristic and admirable entrepreneurial spirit.\nConversely, one of the great strengths to the cultural DNA of the UK is a focus on working together. In many ways you could say it stems from the reformed Catholic church, which is about community and has more of an institutional structure, seeking to work collaboratively. In today’s world you need a bit of both attitudes - as the saying goes: “If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.”\nThe human connection\nOne such way in which I think it’s important for us to do that is in the way we think about our work - individually and collectively in The City, as well as how we communicate our actions beyond the Square Mile.\nI am on the Board for The Centre for Enterprise, Markets and Ethics, based in Oxford, which seeks to bring the values of faith to the enterprise economy and the value of the enterprise economy to faith. They describe their aim as being to:\n“Argue the case for an economy that generates wealth, employment, innovation and enterprise within a framework of calling, integrity, values and ethical behaviour, leading to the transformation of the business enterprise and contributing to the relief of poverty.”\nThey did a study recently, as part of their Enterprise and Values series, titled Ethics and Economics: Economics as servant or master? It made for interesting reading, hinging on the discussion of self-interest in the markets and the need to treat economics as more than transactional, but as purposeful - meeting the needs of others. Instead of thinking of a single trade or sale, we should look at the framework within which that trade exists - as one in a string of transactions, at the end of which there is a person whom you are serving.\nI think this is particularly prevalent in the City of London. I see it in my own work each day as well as in my role as Alderman. It’s important that we have an understanding of the impact we have each day - on individuals and the UK as a whole. However, we also need to do a better job of ensuring that others see and understand how The City can function as a power source for the whole country and the good that it can and does do.\nServing the nation\nSo often, The City is perceived as simply people in suits and skyscrapers, chasing the next pound. There’s inevitably an element of that, but it’s far from the whole story. The City is a powerful contributor to the whole of the UK. Now, more than ever - for the economy, for individual wellbeing, for the cost of living crisis - we have an important role to play in improving the lives of everyone. It’s important people know we’re here for them and we need to communicate that.\nFor example, we talk a lot about the City of London’s tax contribution and how it is spent across the UK - it generates £1.2bn in business rates, representing 5% of England’s total business rates collection. However, that figure alone doesn’t mean a lot to individuals - what does it equate to? Where does it go? What does it do? How is it helping individual people and communities across the UK? Well, if the average cost of an ambulance call out with a trip to A&E is £292, that equates to more than 410,958 trips each year. It’s also enough to run Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust for a year (according to 2022 data from The King’s Fund).\nA change of mindset\nLast month saw the arrival of a new Prime Minister, who faces the unenviable challenge of handling a national, economic issue that has a visceral and direct impact on individual people and businesses. While her role is more public and more obviously linked to each of our personal experiences of everyday life, all of us carry the responsibility for the way our actions impact others.\nEvery day I seek to remember that in each transaction or communication I am part of, no matter how impersonal it seems, there is an individual at the other end of that trade or action for whom it is deeply personal. Yes, The City is a centre of commerce and trade, but it’s ultimately here to serve people. By thinking about it that way, I think we do our jobs better, more compassionately, and we remain focused on the higher purpose of everything we do.",
  "http_www_hughespenney_uk_/http_www_hughespenney_uk_news-views_an-incubator-for-world-leading-innovation/content_45.html": "10 February 2022\nAn incubator for world-leading innovation\nThe City of London has always been a place of growth and innovation, and post pandemic data shows that it’s continuing to honour that tradition.\nStand by the Walkie Talkie, the Gherkin, the Shard, or even Lloyd's of London, some of The City’s most iconic modern buildings, and you will see its equally impressive historic monuments reflected in the glass. The City of London has always been a place of growth and innovation, and post pandemic data shows that it’s continuing to honour that tradition.\nA new report from the City of London Corporation, examining the global business offering of major financial hubs around the world, has shown that London remains the world’s top destination for financial and professional services.\nIt’s a good indication that the City continues to pivot on one of its greatest strengths - its ability to remain relevant to the working world in which it operates. We might have catapulted 10 years in the first 10 weeks at the start of the pandemic as far as technological innovation goes, but sustainable innovation is what will drive us forward.\nIt's something that we need to protect and encourage, ensuring that businesses of all sizes continue to see it as a place paved with opportunity for those with talent and vision.\nA constantly evolving marketplace\nTo reflect for a moment, London’s reputation for innovation will come as no surprise to anyone who believes in the importance of the City and everything it stands for. Nonetheless, it’s reassuring to see data proving that we remain on the right track.\nThis historic, commercial community has been moving with the times for more than 1,000 years. The City of London Corporation itself was founded in 1191, its bustling port is where our livery companies were born, and it has stood the test of time. However, it isn’t something we can be complacent about.\nA more diverse business portfolio\nOver the last few decades, the City has gained a reputation as a financial centre. Banking, finance, brokerage, law and insurance remain essential both to the domestic and overseas markets. However, they are fast being joined by other industries with an emphasis on technology. That evolution has a rather poetic synergy with the history of the City. In lots of ways a more diversified business portfolio is reflective of the world in which it was founded.\nGiven that 99% of the City's 24,020 businesses (as of 2019 data) are SMEs, with masses of potential for the future, it's particularly promising that London has made a name for itself as an incubator of innovative new businesses as well. For example, JF Gauthier, Founder and CEO, Startup Genome, a leading innovation policy advisory and research firm, was quoted in September as saying\n“London’s fundamental strengths in talent, global connectedness and access to funding are the reasons it continues to feature highly in our rankings and remains the number one startup hub in Europe. It’s important for startup hubs all over the world to connect to top ecosystems. As a top-3 ecosystem London has an important role to play in galvanising the global startup community.”\nFurthering its capacity to nurture businesses and not simply sustain them, the UK has a long history of being committed to world-leading research and development (R&D) both from government and within private companies. Expenditure on R&D performed by UK businesses grew by £900 million to £26.9 billion in 2020 with the greatest growth in software development. 75% of that was funded by businesses' own funds followed by overseas funding at 15% (£3.9 billion).\nAnother point of practicality is the UK’s world-class intellectual property (IP) regime to protect innovative ideas - traditional institutions once again working hand in hand with future leaders.\nThe right environment for business to thrive\nInnovation isn’t just about a business portfolio, but the environment that we create as well. Businesses don’t just land in London by happenstance - it’s a rather literal question of ‘build it and they will come’. This is particularly relevant as we all become more environmentally aware, and more aware of the opportunities for a different work life balance thanks to digitisation and so forth.\nMore and more we debate the relevance of geography when it comes to work, community and communications. We can do much online, but it’s not the whole picture. The physical importance of the City as a location for businesses is evidenced by the fact that many choose to headquarter here.\nWhile the pandemic may have shone a light on questions surrounding where and how we work, the City has been cognisant of a need to physically think outside the box in order to meet the needs of the future of work for some time. From the sustainability of buildings to how office spaces are used, things have been changing and continue to do so, with some remarkable ideas. The Canary Wharf Group, for example, has positioned itself as transforming urban spaces in keeping with a market for today and the future. For one thing, they have purchased 100% of their electricity from renewable sources since 2012. Meanwhile, anyone who has been to Fenchurch Street’s Sky Garden will know that the building is much more than a standard office space.\nWith that in mind, The Telegraph reported that London was recently described as having an “unmatched international financial reach”, and that the number of Fortune Global 500 companies that choose to headquarter here grew by a third in the last year.\nAttracting overseas investment\nThe UK might be an island, but connectedness continues to be one of the City’s great assets as well as one of its top priorities in a post-Brexit world. So far, efforts to create the right environment for business development continue to resonate around the globe.\nLast year, Knight Frank London's research forecast that £61.3 billion of cross-border capital could flow into London’s commercial market between 2021 and 2025, up from £55 billion in the period from 2016–2020. It cited that London's ability to attract cross-border investment is at least in part driven by its world-leading research facilities and strength of innovation.\nThe City of London Corporation and the City Property Association has also said that “89% of global institutional investors view London as having the best pool of talent for financial services in Europe.”\nLocate, create and innovate was the headline of the City of London Corporation & CPA’s 2020 report. ‘London in a changing world’ it continued, and that couldn’t have been closer to the truth given the following 18 months.\nLooking forward, there is much to be positive about. There’s a sense of stability alongside an inbuilt appetite for learning, growth and development in The City. Who knows what the gamification wizards at Activision Blizzard might bring to Microsoft or what the metaverse might have in store for the video calls of tomorrow? It seems we are poised to find out."
