We have loved exploring our new community and getting to know everything there is to offer here.\nIn my own experience with my family though, I see daily how overstretched our NHS is and how hard it is to get a dentist appointment. I constantly hear about the lack of appropriate housing. I see the consequence of less police on crime in our communities and making people feel less safe in their high streets. I feel the impact of the cost of living crisis on the everyday decisions we make and the extreme pressure our schools are under from chronic underfunding. I worry that the sewage being pumped into our rivers and seas is causing irreversible damage for future generations.\nI have worked and fought hard for my career. As soon as I was old enough I had a paper round and then moved on to work in my local pharmacy during my GCSE’s and A-Levels. I helped to support myself through university by having a part-time retail job. I graduated in 2008 when the economy collapsed and graduate roles were hard to come by. I persevered and continued to support myself. I didn’t have contacts in law and I didn’t fit the traditional mould – I overcame prejudice and now have a career I am proud of.\nMy parents; a GP and a nurse, instilled in me the importance of public service. This has shaped my career decision as a lawyer to specialise in public law and professional discipline. I hear constantly on the doorstep how disillusioned people are with politicians and that they cannot be trusted. I am passionate about upholding the rule of law and professional standards - honesty and integrity are fundamental to me. It is time for change, not only so that we can build back our communities which are suffering after many years of harmful decisions by Conservative governments, but so we can once again have confidence and trust in those who are elected to represent us.\nAs we prepare for the General Election, I am working hard in Christchurch and with our neighbouring constituencies to share Labour's message so that together we can bring Labour MP’s to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole to work to ensure all of our communities fulfil their potential.",

Labour came second in BCP in the Police and Crime Commissioner elections – we can capitalise on that success and together build a brighter future for our communities.\nChristchurch and East Dorset is a fantastic area and offers so much variety for its residents, but fourteen years of neglect by successive Conservative governments to our public services and the real repercussions of the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis, is having a serious and very real impact on all of us. We cannot continue as we are – we must have change.\nThe decline of our high streets means fewer people are choosing to visit them. As a family we have felt the strain of the NHS and how difficult it can be to get an appointment when we really need one. I have called countless dental practices trying to find an NHS dentist for my children. I worry about the sewage being pumped into our rivers and seas when I watch my own children play with friends in the sea. I have heard countless stories of crime in our communities and even targeting our school buildings.\nWe all deserve better and I want to fight for a better Christchurch and East Dorset where public services are no longer in crisis, people have well-paid and secure jobs, we all feel safe to enjoy everything their community has to offer and which protects its environment for all who live here now, and our future generations.\nI will never take your vote for granted. If you want change, you can send a message to the Conservatives in the next General Election by voting for Labour in Christchurch and East Dorset.\nJo",
  "https_www_joannahoward_org_/https_www_joannahoward_org_missions/content_4.html": "Missions\nI have been out on the doorstep and I constantly hear the same message from those I speak to. These messages form the basis of my priorities to you:\n1\nI would support investment in our public services to reduce NHS waiting times, increase access to NHS dentists and ensure people are able to access quality and affordable social care.\n2\nI would urgently advocate for more support for all of our schools. Schools across our region need more teachers and are in a financial funding crisis which can no longer be ignored.\n3\nI would vote in favour of measures to support our local businesses and innovation. Local businesses are the heart of our communities and I would do all I can to reinvigorate our high streets, so our businesses can create well-paid and good quality jobs.\n4\nI would vote in favour of greater protections for our incredible coastline and I would do all I can to end the dumping of raw sewage into our seas and rivers. I would support investment in cleaner, greener energy.\n5\nI have seen first-hand the need for more police on our streets to address the rise in crime and anti-social behaviour so I will be voting to increase the numbers of police on our streets and supporting measures to reduce violence against women and girls. We also need to protect all children and ensure appropriate support is available to those facing homelessness or struggling with addiction.\n6\nFrom renters to small businesses owners to homeowners, everyone is feeling the impact of the cost of living crisis. I would vote on measures to address this, including to bring in a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants so that their record profits can be used to ease the pressure on the cost of living.",

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS\nAs a data subject, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.\nRight of access\nYou may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a “subject access request“).\nWe follow the ICO’s “Subject Access Code of Practice” when dealing with requests for access to personal data. You can read this code by visiting https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2014223/subject-access-code-of-practice.pdf.\nPlease note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to or contain your personal data.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at joannahoward4christchurch@gmail.com and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to rectification and erasure\nYou may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten“).\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at joannahoward4christchurch@gmail.com and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to restrict processing\nWhere we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the sections of this privacy policy which explain how and why we use your information), you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.\nYou may also ask us to stop processing your personal data: (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us to verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; or (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nPlease note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at joannahoward4christchurch@gmail.com and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to portability\nWhere you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.\nBecause of the kind of the nature of our work do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party, we are happy to consider such requests in good faith.\nYour right to stop receiving communications\nAs noted above, where we send you email marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those communications).\nAlternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us directly – you can unsubscribe by contacting us at joannahoward4christchurch@gmail.com and telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.\nYour right to object to automated decision making and profiling\nYou have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.\nExercising your rights\nWhen you write to us making a request to exercise your rights, we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\nIt will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information, then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case, we will tell you).\nYou will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, in exceptional circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one (1) month. However, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you of this and keep you updated.\n16. RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is the supervisory body authorised by the Data Protection Act 2018 to regulate the handling of personal data within the United Kingdom.\nThe contact details for the ICO are:\n-\nInformation Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF\n-\nTelephone: 0303 123 1113\nWebsite: https://ico.org.uk/concerns/"
