I hope everyone had a relaxed and enjoyable time with friends and family. With Parliament in Recess, I’m just sharing a brief update of what I’ve been doing as your MP over the last couple of weeks.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn Parliament\n|\n-\nAhead of Easter Recess, MPs and Peers voted on the Safety of Rwanda Bill. I voted against this legislation once again, with the House of Lords inflicting defeat on the government in all seven votes later in the week. People don’t make the dangerous journey across the Channel for fun or with an intimate knowledge of the UK asylum system. This policy will not work on its stated terms of stopping people arriving via small boats. The amount of parliamentary time that has been spent debating this pointless legislation is a reflection of the Tories’ political priorities, not our country’s. Instead of continuing to fund this right wing vanity project, we need a government that will focus on speeding up claims, expanding safe routes, and helping people rebuild their lives.\n-\nI voted for the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill. More oversight is needed to acknowledge the ever-changing nature of national security threats and greater protections are needed to protect our children from sexual abuse and grooming in the online and tech spaces.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSolidarity with Diane Abbott\n|\nFrank Hester’s alleged comments about Diane Abbott in 2019 were reprehensible, racist and misogynist. The Prime Minister initially refused to comment on the alleged comments, which were a deluge of the vilest misogynoir. His subsequent apology was completely undermined by the fact that he is keeping the £10.7 million given to his party by Frank Hester.\nAt Prime Minister’s Questions, when the issue was first being discussed in Parliament, Diane stood up forty-six times to speak and was not called. Others were debating the abuse she has faced while she was in the chamber and unable to speak for herself. She was silenced. The treatment of Diane over the years has been unacceptable, and I stand with Diane and wish for this torrent of abuse to end.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nCaribbean African Health Network\n|\n|\nI was pleased to host the Caribbean African Health Network in Parliament. As chair of the APPG for Black Maternal Health , it was so encouraging to see a concerted effort by Black clinicians to turn the discourse on the health disparities impacting the Black community into policy.\nThe results of the work done by the Black Maternal Health APPG and FIVEXMORE is evidence of the fact that visibility can inspire change. There is, however, more work to be done with Black people’s health outcomes across the board still worse relative to other groups.\nBlack people are more likely to live in deprived areas and have poorer economic circumstances. They are also less likely to get the care they need as a result of medical racism. We all know this, and we have all discussed this, but it is time we have action to create tangible change.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nEndometriosis Action Month Event\n|\n|\nIt was great to host Endometriosis UK during Endometriosis Action Month to discuss Menstrual Cycle Support’s new initiative for teenagers. Menstrual education helps to relieve menstrual pain by providing people with the tools to access the care they need. There is a chronic lack of investment into women’s health especially in menstrual health. With most women suffering with Dysmenorrhoea at some stage and 1 in 10 women suffering from endometriosis, more attention needs to be given to solutions that mitigate the periodic suffering of menstruating people.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVisit to Bradford University for International Women’s Day\n|\n|\nIt was great to be back at my alma mater, the University of Bradford, to give a talk on inequalities in health research and development and deliver an Athena Swan workshop. It is important that we continue to shed light on the continued disparities in provisions for women’s health and men’s health. Women’s reproductive health needs the same funding and attention as men’s.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAction on ASB Public Meeting\n|\n|\nLast week, I attended a public meeting alongsideLambeth Council, the Metropolitan Police and other agencies on tackling the reduction of antisocial behaviour. Though residents were disappointed with the results of the meeting, it still represented the culmination of the hard work being done in the community on this issue. Thank you to Action on ASB Brixton for organising this event. It was a great show of strength from the community, demanding accountability and action in making our area safer. There will of course be future meetings on this issue and I will support the efforts of Action on ASB and others to achieve progress.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLambeth Islamic Academy’s Ramadan Iftar Party\n|\n|\nIt was lovely to attend the Lambeth Islamic Academy’s Ramadan Iftar Party this week. Thank you to everyone who attended and to the organisers for bringing together the local community and putting together on an amazing spread of food.\n|\n|\nLambeth Charity Networking Event\n|\nThere is a Lambeth Charity Networking Event taking place on Thursday 9th May, 4pm – 6pm at the High Trees Hub (220 Upper Tulse Hill, SW2 2NS). The event is an opportunity for Lambeth charities to get together with their peers to share learning or challenges or find out about others’ work and new opportunities. This should be particularly useful for more nascent organisations who may be smaller but also for those that are more established too.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_african-remembrance-day-2024/content_186.html": "I was honoured to give one of the keynote speeches for African Remembrance Day, an annual event held on Emancipation Day (1st August), at the London Museum Docklands. The Slavery Abolition Act came into force across the British Empire 190 years ago to the day. This day is an occasion to remember all those who were kidnapped, trafficked and tortured as a result of hundreds of years of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.\nIt is also an invitation to remember those who grew rich from it. Instead of compensating slaves, the government took out its biggest ever loan to pay the slavers: £300bn in today’s money. We only finished paying off this loan in 2015. The legacy of slavery and colonialism persists in the continuing inequality and racism we face today. Building a world free from these things requires us to confront this history and work towards reparative justice to address its damaging legacy.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_27th-may-newsletter/content_584.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n27th May 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThe Government brought its latest piece of anti-worker legislation back before Parliament this week. Monday evening saw MPs considering the Lords amendments on the Minimum Service Levels Bill. As I’ve maintained since this Bill was introduced before Parliament, this legislation was never intended to ensure minimum service levels in our public services on strike days; but to stop stopping workers in our public services from demanding them. I voted for amendments designed to counter the damaging impact of this legislation. Nobody should be sacked for demanding a fair deal at work.\n|\n|\nOn Tuesday, I also voted in favour of Labour Opposition Day motions on leasehold reform and school building safety. Labour’s first motion urged the Government to keep its promise to the millions of people living in leasehold properties and end this feudal system of ownership. Our second motion sought to map out the state of school building disrepair after thirteen years of the Tories running down our infrastructure.\nOn Wednesday, I voted for amendments to the EU Retained Law Bill. This legislation paves the way for the Government to change or remove hundreds of baseline environmental, employment and consumer protections, without proper Parliamentary oversight. It should be those who the public vote to represent them, not ministers and civil servants in back rooms in Whitehall, who get the final say on laws that affect our daily lives.\n|\n|\nReparations: Pushing the Conversation Forwards\n|\n|\nOn Tuesday night, I was honoured to host a parliamentary panel put on by law firm Leigh Day with the support of the APPG on African Reparations. We heard from some some eminent guests including Lord Anthony Gifford KC (Barrister and member of Jamaica’s National Council on Reparations), David Commissiong (Lawyer and Barbados’ Ambassador to CARICOM), Jacqui McKenzie (Leigh Day Partner), Verene Shepherd (vice-chair, CARICOM Commission on Reparations) and Walker Syachalinga (Leigh Day Trainee). When a country commits an international crime like genocide, it is supposed to make amends to the victims, including the descendants of the original victims who still suffer the consequences of the crime. We had a wide-ranging discussion about how this might be pursued via legal means. Crimes against humanity warrant reparations.\nI also appeared on a discussion on Al Jazeera with the former BBC journalist and Heirs of Slavery founder, Laura Trevelyan, and American historian Uju Anya. We discussed the Government’s refusal to offer a formal apology (or even express regret) for the Transatlantic Slave Trade at Prime Minister’s Question Time.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStarting the Race for Life\n|\n|\nCongratulations to everyone who took part in Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life on Clapham Common this morning to raise funds to fight cancer. It was an honour to be there to support the event and get the races underway. Over 8 million people have participated in the Race for Life in the past 20 years, raising over £547 million to fund the charity’s life-saving work. I welcome these fundraising efforts. Cancer is something that will affect all of us in one way or another throughout our lives and it’s so important that efforts to fight it are properly resourced.\n|\n|\nAttending CAFOD’s Parliamentary Reception\n|\n|\nIt was great to meet with CAFOD on Monday at the invitation of my constituent Jack to speak about the organisation’s work fighting global hunger. I recently visited Kenya with CAFOD to see how they are supporting communities on the frontline of climate breakdown and hunger crisis. With Eastern Africa facing its worst drought in 40 years and millions facing starvation, the UK must continue its support for this vital work and to the region. I was proud to stand on a manifesto proposing an aid-funded Food Sovereignty Fund to enable small-scale farmers in the Global South to gain access to land, seeds and finance, and uphold indigenous peoples’ land rights.\n|\n|\nVisit to Brixton Prison\n|\n|\nI had a very informative visit to HMP Brixton yesterday to meet the Prison Advice and Care Trust (Pact) team alongside Councillor Marianna Masters. It was good to speak to prisoners on the wings and find out more about Pact’s vital work supporting the rehabilitation of current and former prisoners.\n|\n|\nEndometriosis Film Screening: ‘All Up There’\n|\n|\nThis week, I hosted two film screenings about important and commonly overlooked healthcare issues. On Monday, I hosted a screening of a short film about the complexities coming of age with Endometriosis, ‘All Up There’ – directed by Bonnie McCrae. Endometriosis affects over 1.5 million women across the UK, including me. Women with this condition experience pain on a daily basis but often wait years for a diagnosis. As well as more research into the condition, we also need to see better workplace protections, flexible working rights and a more open culture around menstrual health.\n|\n|\nFilm Screening: Black Blood\n& Organ Donors Needed\n|\n|\nOn Thursday, I also hosted a screening of ‘A Living Legacy’ a film made by Action on Blood to raise awareness of the urgent need for more Black blood and organ donors. This is a brilliant film that breaks down this issue in a very human way. I hope to see it touring widely over the coming months to help get the message out there. With 250 donations now needed every day for sickle cell patients and demand only likely to grow, we urgently need more people from Black ethnicities to come forwards and give blood. Just fifteen minutes of your time can save someone else’s life. Ethnically matched blood provides the best treatment for sickle cell, keeping those most severely affected healthy and enabling them to lead fulfilling lives. With thousands of new Black blood donors required, I want to see the Government exploring further reforms around blood donation too.\n|\n|\nSort the System Lobby:\nDiscussing Electoral Reform\n|\n|\nThank you to constituents who came to Westminster to discuss the question of Proportional Representation and wider electoral reform. Labour’s 2019 General Election manifesto supported a UK-wide Constitutional Convention to deal with electoral reforms and help revive our democracy. First. I recognise that our current electoral system leaves much to be desired and often fails to properly reflect our electorate as a whole, massively inflating the Tory vote in particular. It’s clear we need a whole range of electoral reforms to increase participation and revive our democratic processes. I believe any future Labour Government should start by lowering the voting age to 16, extending the franchise to all UK residents, and repealing discriminatory voter ID laws.\n|\n|\nMeeting with the National Union of Students\n|\nI met with officers from the National Union of Students this week, who asked for my support on their campaign to address the cost of living crisis for students and on their student voter registration campaign. Soaring living costs are impacting students especially hard given that maintenance loans have not kept pace with inflation whilst rents have skyrocketed. Too many young people feel alienated and excluded from our political system. I welcome the NUS’s efforts to raise awareness of the Voter ID reform, register students to vote, and add Student and Young Person’s ID Cards to the list of recognised ID.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_cancel-debts-and-let-poorer-countries-fight-climate-breakdown/content_200.html": "I took part in a Westminster Hall debate on debt cancellation for low-income countries. I pointed out the debilitating impact of these debts in the context of the climate emergency. Many indebted countries now find themselves on the frontline of a climate crisis which they did little to cause. Their efforts to fight climate change are undermined by the high levels of debt they owe, often to lenders in the very same countries that have contributed most to climate breakdown.\nI spoke about my 2023 visit to Kenya, where I witnessed the impact of one of the worst droughts in living memory. Kenya is spending five times more on debt repayments than climate protection measures. With this figure typical of low-income countries as a whole, it’s clear that they are tackling climate breakdown with both hands tied behind their back with devastating consequences for human life and our environment.\nI framed my remarks in the context of reparative justice. The UK’s role as a global financial centre is itself a legacy of our extractive imperial past. However, it now puts us in a unique position to rectify the unequal burdens of debt and climate breakdown by pushing banks, asset managers and hedge funds to participate in debt relief schemes – something they are reluctant to do. 90% of bonds owed by countries eligible for debt relief are issued in the UK. Pushing for debt cancellation is urgent because of the climate crisis and it is not a matter of charity but a matter of justice.",

But months later, his family are still waiting for the outcome of this decision. On the anniversary of his death, his family reiterated their dignified and restrained plea for truth, accountability, and justice. These things should be hardwired into policing; but they are not.\nI hosted a parliamentary event for the Kaba family and other campaigners involved in the long struggle for justice this week.

The dominant framing around the issue is the question of money, with large sums being bandied around. Whilst it is important to quantify the scale of economic damage our country inflicted by enslaving and colonising peoples around the world, it is also important to recognise that no sum of money could recompense such suffering.

Set up by Black mums Tinuke and Clo, Five X More have done so much already to put this issue on the agenda over the last three years. Thanks to them and to other brilliant black birth campaigners, we are now having a serious conversation about these disparities.\nThis week is a reminder that decision -makers need to listen and start acting on what they are saying. Pregnancy and childbirth are two of the most vulnerable times of any woman’s life. But for mothers and birthing people of colour having children in the UK, this vulnerability is compounded by racial disparities in maternal healthcare.\nIn 2021, Black, mixed race, and Asian women in the UK are respectively four, three, and two times more likely to die during pregnancy or childbirth. These disparities extend right across the experience of maternity, with study after study showing black women and birthing people are significantly more likely to experience stillbirth, miscarriage, neonatal death, and near misses.\nAll the research shows these disparities cannot be explained by socioeconomic factors alone. Even after controlling for factors like class, country of origin and access to healthcare, black women are still significantly more likely to suffer maternal mortality and morbidity. The only explanation is the persistence of racism.\nWe know that the Government doesn’t like to talk about the ongoing impact of race has on life in Britain in 2021 but these poor outcomes are too serious to ignore. Bringing children into the world should not be a matter or life or death for any woman in a wealthy country like the UK, whatever the colour of her skin.\nTo mark this week, I secured a parliamentary debate to discuss why black mothers and birthing people face such a heightened risk and what we can do to change this. The fact we are having an honest conversation about our experiences and these disparities signifies progress, with decision-makers finally listening to what we have been telling them for a long time.\nBut it’s not just about listening to our stories, it’s about acting. That starts with a concrete commitment to improving outcomes. With the Government still reluctant to introduce binding targets and resource the change we need to see, we must keep piling on the pressure. The colour of your skin should have no impact on your health or your baby’s.\nThis article was first published on South London Press on the 23rd September 2021.",

Those reporting difficulties include key workers, including teachers who’ve seen infections on the rise in their schools and health workers.\nThis reflects a wider national situation where people are struggling to get access to tests for coronavirus. LBC reported yesterday on how its journalists were unable to secure a test in any of the top ten coronavirus hostpots in the UK.\nToday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted in Parliament that it would take “weeks” to resolve the issue.\nThe news also comes as hospital bosses warned that a lack of access to testing for frontline NHS workers was putting services at risk.\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour Member of Parliament for Streatham, said:\n“The influx of complaints from my constituents shows that our shambolic outsourced test and trace system has reached breaking point.\nToday, the Government said it would still take weeks to fix these issues but we were promised a working system months ago now.

It’s the latest chapter in removing key scrutiny powers away from the judiciary, placing British authorities beyond the law, and squashing dissent.\nCovert Human Intelligence Sources – undercover agents – are licenced to break certain laws in order to infiltrate and affiliate with criminal networks. The covert operations they run can play a role in keeping us all safe. It’s important that the police have the power to disrupt criminal activities like terrorism, organised crime, human trafficking and child sexual exploitation.\nHowever, even a cursory glance at the history of covert operations reveals they have resulted in some of the gravest human rights breaches and tended to creep beyond their stated purpose into contentious territory.\nOn the first count, we have examples of the UK state’s entanglement in political killings. The death of Belfast lawyer, Pat Finucane, who was shot fourteen times while having Sunday lunch with his family by Loyalist paramilitaries from the Ulster Defence Association is a reminder of the life and death issues that rest on this Bill. This legislation does nothing to prevent something similar from happening again, nor does it contain provisions to prohibit the most severe human rights violations: murder, sexual offences, torture and kidnap.\nA former head of MI5, no less, has pointed out there are “no limits” to the crimes that covert agents can commit. Not only does this Bill make it impossible to prosecute these crimes, where they do overstep the mark, it actually allows for prior authorisation to commit crimes, with no judicial oversight. In other words, this legislation is completely counter to the rule of law. Even in the USA, there are exceptions which proscribe involvement in murder and torture.\nOn the second count, we have the long history of state agents infiltrating trade unions, protest movements and even placing sitting left-wing MPs under surveillance. The current guidelines permit covert operations on the basis of “preventing disorder”; a remit so broad and vague that it could arguably include the government’s handling of the pandemic.\nOf course, we know what “preventing disorder” often means in practice: clamping down on dissent; as countless people can attest, from the Hillsborough disaster survivors who fought for justice, to the Orgreave miners whose strike was brutally broken on the back of covert intelligence. We should be clear that covert operations have no place in policing everyday workplaces or squashing legitimate democratic movements.\nWhen it came to light that the Stephen Lawrence campaign was infiltrated by undercover officers – after a series of reviews – Theresa May set up the Pitchford Inquiry, recognising “appalling practices in undercover policing”. It is suspicious, to say the least that the Government is bringing this Bill forwards before this Inquiry has reported its findings.\nI agree that there’s an argument for placing these activities on the statute book and dragging some of the state’s murkier activities out into the light for proper scrutiny. But the Government argues that it’s putting down this Bill to place “existing practice on a clear and statutory footing”. Given that the status quo is clearly leading to human rights violations and discriminatory incursions onto peoples’ civil liberties, we should be deeply suspicious about putting it straight onto the statute book. Still more so, given the limited amount of oversight it entails for the use of these powers. An annual commissioner’s report doesn’t give us the detail we need.\nCovert operations are sometimes necessary to prevent crimes and limit loss of life, but we cannot risk legalising and normalising such wide-ranging breaches of civil liberties, or such extreme human rights violations.\nWe need to put clear limitations and proper oversight in place to prevent the gravest violations and curb the use of such powers for purely political reasons. Our police and security services should exist to uphold the rule of the law, not to break it.\nThis article first appeared on Left Foot Forward on the 6th of October: https://leftfootforward.org/2020/10/why-i-defied-the-whip-to-oppose-this-damaging-new-security-bill/",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_a-debt-is-owed-the-uk-should-transition-from-traditional-aid-to-reparations/content_21.html": "Last week, the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) summit in Samoa amplified growing calls for the United Kingdom to engage in meaningful discussions on reparations for countries impacted by slavery and colonialism.\nDespite the UK ruling out reparations from the official agenda, the demand from descendants of enslaved people and nations harmed by colonialism remains loud and clear. The word ‘reparations’ comes from the Latin reparare, meaning to repair. Reparations are not just about addressing historic wrongs; they are about repairing the lasting inequalities inflicted over centuries.\nAs the UK considers its role in international development, reparations offer a justice-driven alternative to traditional ‘aid’. By acknowledging the centuries of harm caused by the extraction of resources in different forms from colonised nations, the UK can begin to repair the injustices that have enriched it at the expense of others. This is not about charity; it’s about fairness and redress for the immense economic, ecological and societal damage inflicted by colonialism.\nBetween 1765 and 1938, Britain extracted approximately £9tn (adjusted for inflation) from India alone through taxation and resource exploitation. This drain of wealth underpinned Britain’s industrialisation and economic dominance, while leaving colonised nations impoverished. Such staggering figures dwarf the UK’s overseas aid budget (£15.4bn in 2023).\nBut the harm wasn’t solely financial. Colonialism devastated ecosystems, displaced communities, and inflicted political and psychological damage that endures to this day. Reparations would acknowledge this exploitation as a debt owed, not a gesture of charity, and start to pave a new way forward.\nThe issue of reparations is about more than just handing over money – it’s about addressing the structural inequalities that colonialism created and still perpetuates. These disparities are starkly evident in the fight against climate change. Worsening droughts in East Africa, and tropical hurricanes in the Caribbean, show how former colonies remain disproportionately vulnerable to the front-line effects of a crisis they did little to cause. As a leading historic emitter, the UK could take responsibility by framing reparations within the context of climate justice. Reparations could fund large-scale restoration projects, compensate for biodiversity loss, and help nations adapt to climate change without the burden of debt.\nFor the UK to make genuine progress toward reparations, it must first confront its colonial legacy and the ongoing mechanisms that legitimise it. This requires moving beyond feelings of guilt and towards engaging in open, truthful dialogue about how colonialism has entrenched global and domestic inequality. It also means examining the UK’s influence within powerful decision making bodies like the G7 and the UN Security Council, and how that influence can be used to promote or erode global justice. These bodies often perpetuate the very inequalities that reparations seek to address by prioritising the interests of high-income countries.\nA full programme of reparative justice would cover and account for compensation, cultural returns, restoration of dignity, and reconnection for a shared future. The UK can transition from traditional aid to reparations by addressing the racism and structural inequalities that manifest in global governance, trade and tax systems that continue to disadvantage lower-income countries. Aid may alleviate short-term suffering, but it does not address the structural drivers of inequality, many of which are inseparable from colonialism and racial hierarchies. A genuine commitment to reparations would help tackle the root causes of poverty and climate vulnerability while restoring dignity and agency to communities formerly oppressed by colonialism.\nOur country has a moral and legal duty to address past injustices like slavery and colonialism. Failing to engage with the case for reparations shows a disregard for the nations and individuals who live with their enduring impact. The UK should instead lead by example, embracing reparations as a means of tackling the root causes of climate breakdown and structural inequality, rectifying our colonial legacy, and building a fairer, more equal world.\nThis article was first published by Politics Home and in the House Magazine on 30th October 2024.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_why-i-oppose-disability-benefit-cuts/content_129.html": "My inbox is filling up with emails highlighting the devastating impact of the government’s planned disability benefit cuts. On this page, I’ve tried to set out exactly why I oppose cutting disability benefits in the way the government has proposed.\nThe proposed ‘Pathways to Work: Reforming Benefits and Support to Get Britain Working Green Paper’ would rip £5 billion out of our welfare system, removing support from some of the most vulnerable people in our society. There is widespread consensus that our social security system needs reform. However, these disability benefit cuts risk entrenching the poverty and inequality many people already face.\nThe reality is that any one of us might need to rely on the social security system at any point in our lives. We all deserve a well-funded system that enables us to live full and independent lives, whatever unexpected challenges face.\nWhat are the government’s planned disability benefit cuts?\nAt the core of the government’s plan is a massive overhaul to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs). PIPs are paid to people with a disability, regardless of how much they earn or whether they are in work. Indeed, in many cases, people use them in order to access work opportunities. Requiring help to wash and dress, prepare and eat food, go to the toilet, or remember to take medicine wouldn’t qualify you for support.\nOther proposed reforms include:\n- Freezing the Universal Credit health top-up for current claimants, cutting it for new claimants by £2,444 a year and denying these payments to young people aged 18 to 21.\n- Implementing “Right to Try” legislation for ill and disabled people to ensure they are not penalised for trying to go back to work.\n- Scrapping the work capability assessment for the Universal Credit health top-up and replacing it with a general PIP assessment.\n- More face-to-face assessments for people claiming disability benefits.\n- No reassessments for people with chronic disabilities.\n- £1 billion investment in jobs programmes to get people back into work.\nTo be clear, there are some positive measures in the government’s green paper. I welcome, in particular, the Right to Try guarantee. This would mean that people who accept a job offer are not subject to automatic re-assessment if it doesn’t work out. In other words, they will be able to fall back on the same level of benefits they currently receive. This is a compassionate and pragmatic policy which removes a crucial disincentive for ill and disabled people from re-entering the workforce.\nSadly, I fear positive measures like the Right to Try will be seriously undermined by the sheer scale of the cuts being proposed. Running counter to this are the government’s plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payments, which many disabled people rely on to access work.\nI am also concerned that some of the government is not consulting on some of the most significant changes being proposed.\nI will vote against these disability benefit cuts\nCutting support to those who rely on it most is cruel and counter-productive. It’s not too late for the government to change course on these proposals but if they do come to a vote, I will be voting against them. Disability benefits like PIP are a lifeline which sustain people and enable them to live independent lives. Being ill or disabled is not a choice and the reality is that any one of us might need to fall back on this social safety net at some point in our lives.\nI am very concerned about the impact of these disability benefit cuts\nScope has called these the “biggest cuts to disability benefits on record”—a damning indictment considering the cuts made by the Tories over the last 14 years. They will be disastrous for disabled people’s independence, equality, choice and control.\nEarly analysis of the government’s green paper by the Resolution Foundation found that up to 1.2 million people will lose £4,200 and £6,300 a year. Many hundreds of thousands more will lose out on incapacity benefits. Some people could be losing nearly £10,000 a year by 2029/30.\nThis is happening in a context where disabled people have bore the brunt of the Tories’ austerity and cuts. The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities found that ‘grave and systematic violations’ of Disabled persons’ rights had taken place because of austerity measures and welfare reforms since 2010.\nNearly half of all families in poverty include at least one disabled person. PIP is a gateway benefit, which entitles family members to claim other benefits: from carer’s allowance, to Blue Badges and Disabled Persons’ Railcards. Half of the 1 million carer’s allowance claims in the UK are tied to PIP claims.\nOne study attributed 148,000 excess deaths between 2011-2019 to austerity measures implemented by the coalition government. Cuts have consequences and I am worried we will count the ultimate cost of this policy in lost lives.\nI’m calling on the government to publish a full Equality Impact Assessment of their green paper\nFrom early analysis, we can see that these cuts are going to have devastating consequences for some of the poorest and most systematically disadvantaged people in our country. Until the government publishes the equality impact assessment for its green paper, it isn’t clear exactly how many people will be affected, where these cuts will fall, or who will be hit hardest. The government has committed to publishing a full impact assessment of this policy and I’ll be holding them to this.\nWhen the Tories were in power, they repeatedly refused to publish full equality impact assessments of major policy decisions, even though these are vital to informed debate. A key test of this government will be whether it reverses these cuts if this assessment shows, as we fear, that they will harm people with protected characteristics. The last Labour government that wrote equality into our law. This government must comply with that.\nIf the government is looking for money, they should look to those with the broadest shoulders\nNobody is pretending that the government has not inherited a dire financial situation. Equally, nobody could seriously suggest that the way out of this situation is to repeat the same dismal policy choices that put us here in the first place.\nRipping £5 billion out of the social security system is a political choice, prioritising short-term savings over long-term investments in our collective wellbeing as a society. We don’t need a re-run of the last government’s raids on the social security system, we need to tax the rich.\nDiscussion on this is blocked by much of the establishment but there are a range of other options, including a 2% wealth tax on assets over £10 million, which would raise up to £24 billion a year. On the very week, the government announced these cuts, millionaires parked a bus outside Parliament to call for just such a tax. When millionaires are literally begging to pay more tax, the government has to think again.\nWe need to look at the root causes of rising sickness and disability claims\nEvery week, I hear from constituents affected by mental health issues and this is inseparable from the society we have inherited. There is a correlation between the widespread mental health we are experiencing as a society and austerity, low-quality gig economy work, entrenched inequality, crumbling public services, unaffordable housing and escalating living costs.\nThis government was elected with a mandate to tackle the deep-rooted issues holding us back as a country and a society. We know the number of people who rely on sickness or disability benefit is rising. This is a very complicated issue with deep-rooted social causes. The underfunding of mental health services over many years has left many young people without the support they need to cope. The government is working to bring down record-high NHS waiting lists created on the Tories’ watch, undoubtedly another major factor behind the rise.\nI’m concerned that the government’s rhetoric and policy conflates symptom with cure. Rather than tackling the underlying socioeconomic determinants of a mental health epidemic and rising sickness claims, disability benefits cuts would simply remove support. Indeed, as many people have pointed out, cutting income for people who are ill or disabled is liable to worsen their living conditions with ramifications for their health. Likewise, forcing people into work when they are not ready could have similar results.",

The measures outlined in our joint letter would go a long way towards ensuring this.”\nClaudia Webbe, MP for Leicester East said:\n“Renters are another group being badly left behind and let down by this Government.

Rishi Sunak’s impassioned defence of these unjustified tax breaks at PMQs, even as he attacked key workers for calling strikes show how out of touch the Tories are. They would sooner see state schools with overworked teachers, hungry pupils and crumbling buildings than end subsidies for private schools.\nFinally, Labour has been pushing once again for an end to non-dom status, something which has personally saved our super rich Prime Minister and his family up to £20 million. At a time when the Government claims to be scratching around for money, what possible justification is there for letting a small group of very rich people off the hook for billions of pounds?",

I was proud to call for justice alongside Windrush survivors and elders from the African and Caribbean communities who have shaped the culture and success of our area. If the Government was serious about learning the lessons of the Windrush Scandal and ensuring nobody has to endure what its survivors did, they would be implementing the Windrush Lessons Learned Review in full, not u-turning on key commitments. They would be taking the failed compensation scheme away from the unreformed department that administered the Windrush Scandal in the first place. Finally, they would not be extending the hostile environment that caused so much suffering, they would be ending and replacing it with a fair and humane immigration system.

This year, it came two days earlier than in 2023: a sign that the annual gender pay gap has increased for the first time since 2014. With the gender pay gap widening in the last year, the government must keep working to ensure women are paid the same as men for the same work.

I met with teachers from Streatham and Clapham High School and their National Education Union representative to discuss the impact of these proposals, which they are being threatened with.\nLeaving the Teachers’ Pension Scheme would hit loyal, hard-working teachers hard in their retirement – a poor reward for the extraordinary efforts they made to teach under pandemic conditions. Worse still, the Trust is proposing to fire and rehire them if they do not voluntarily agree. The case for moving out of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme is based on two pieces of speculation: that the employer contribution in the scheme will increase to 30% and Business Rate Relief will be removed from independent schools.\nTo date, the Trust have refused requests from the National Education Union to conduct an Equality Impact Assessment on their proposals. The Union is concerned that the changes will exacerbate the pension inequality already suffered by women, given that an estimated 75% of the affected staff are women. They are also concerned that it won’t end with GDST, with academies also considering similar moves to downgrade pensions.

Belly, who had an underlying respiratory condition, subsequently contracted coronavirus and died in Barnet Hospital on the 5th of April.\nAfter an investigation lasting 19 days, the British Transport Police concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with the crime.\nThe British Transport Police subsequently referred the decision to the Crown Prosecution Service, who concluded there were not any grounds to alter the original police decision.\nThe parliamentarians’ letter calls on Boris Johnson to launch a public inquiry into Belly’s death, citing unanswered questions including concerns over her employer’s handling of the case and highlighting the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on frontline workers and individuals from BAME communities.\nBell Ribeiro-Addy MP (Streatham, Labour), who wrote the letter, said:\n“Belly’s family deserves answers. It’s clear that there are unanswered questions about the incident in question, as well as her employer’s conduct in this situation.\nWe need to get a full understanding of what happened and why, to prevent the same thing from happening all over again.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n- Full text of the letter below along with list of signatories.\n- Letter from lawyers attached.\nDear Prime Minister,\nWe write to you to call for a public inquiry into the death of Belly Mujinga.\nAs you will no doubt be aware, Belly and her colleague, Motolani Sunmola, both employees of Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) were spat at by a customer at Victoria station on 21st March. Belly, who had an underlying health condition, subsequently contracted coronavirus and died in Barnet Hospital on the 5th of April.\nIt is clear that there are unanswered questions about the incident in question, as well as her employer’s conduct in this situation. We are highly concerned by reports that Belly and her colleague were sent out onto the Victoria station concourse by GTR without adequate PPE, and on the basis of bad medical advice. As a government contractor, GTR must be held to the highest standards on both workplace safety and anti-discrimination practice. We all know that whilst the coronavirus has highlighted the issue of safety at work, every year thousands suffer work-related illnesses, injuries and deaths. Safety at work is a right, not a privilege.\nBelly’s death is sad evidence of a wider trend. Black people are statistically more likely to work in frontline jobs where they cannot work from home, placing them at heightened risk of contracting the virus. Government statistics have repeatedly shown how frontline workers and Black people are both at a heightened risk of dying from coronavirus during the pandemic. According to ONS data published in June, Black women are two and a half times more likely to die with COVID-19 than white women.\nIt is paramount that we get to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding Belly Mujinga’s death. With coronavirus cases once again spiralling out of control in the UK, we need to understand the failings of the past to protect the most vulnerable in the near future.\nWe therefore join the two million people who signed her family’s petition in calling for justice and urge the government to hold a public inquiry into the full circumstances of her death.\nYours sincerely,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\nDiane Abbott MP, Hannah Bardell MP, Paula Barker MP, Apsana Begum MP, Olivia Blake MP, Baroness Christine Blower, Baroness Pauline Bryan, Dawn Butler MP, Richard Burgon MP, Ian Byrne MP, Baroness Shami Chakrabarti CBE, Sarah Champion MP, Jeremy Corbyn MP, Stella Creasy MP, Jon Cruddas MP, Allan Dorans MP, Dr Stephen Farry MP, Claire Hanna MP, Lord John Hendy QC, Wera Hobhouse MP, Rachel Hopkins MP, George Howarth MP, Christine Jardine MP, Kim Johnson MP, Ian Lavery MP, Clive Lewis MP, Tony Lloyd MP, Caroline Lucas MP, Siobhain McDonagh MP, John McDonnell MP, Anne McLaughlin MP, Ian Mearns MP, Navendu Mishra MP, Grahame Morris MP, Sarah Olney MP, Kate Osamor MP, Kate Osborne MP, Virendra Sharma MP, Tommy Sheppard MP, Andy Slaughter MP, Jamie Stone MP, Zarah Sultana MP, Sam Tarry MP, Alison Thewliss MP , Stephen Timms MP, Claudia Webbe MP, Dr Philippa Whitford MP, Mick Whitley MP, Nadia Whittome MP, Beth Winter MP.\nFor further information about this press release, please contact Ollie Collard, Communications Officer, Office of Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP at oliver.collard@parliament.uk",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_grieving-chris-kaba-and-holding-the-met-police-accountable/content_204.html": "Chris Kaba’s family, and Streatham’s community, are in pain. The Met Police needs to give us answers.\nChris Kaba, who on Monday was shot dead by police in Streatham at the age of 24, grew up in this area and is very much loved here. There’s a lot of community trauma; people are upset whether they knew Chris or not.\nThe Met Police is under special measures; we know there are failures. It’s understandable that people would think that Chris has been a victim of racism. Without the information to say otherwise, if you’re from a Black community, it’s an assumption that you’re able to make again and again. Black communities end up being over-policed as citizens and under-served as victims. Should we find ourselves in trouble, we need to be able to trust the police, but people don’t. It just adds an extra layer of oppression.\nThere’s a long history of the Met Police’s persecutory treatment of minority and Black communities. They are not learning lessons from this history. It seems to be business as usual.\nI’m always going to be on the side of my community. There’s an expectation to help calm tensions in my community and it’s difficult when you don’t know what’s happening. Failing to communicate – for example, it took over 48 hours for the IOPC to reveal Chris was unarmed – has brought a lot of hurt and anger. His family have little confidence in the current process and are now calling for this to be a homicide investigation.\nThe Met Police claim that they’re trying to rebuild trust and confidence, when trust and confidence in this area and in the police in general are at its all time lowest, particularly amongst Black communities. In Lambeth, just 39% of people trust the police to treat everyone fairly no matter who they are, which is the lowest level of any London borough, according to a public survey by the mayor’s office for policing and crime. When you consider the recent case of Ian Taylor, who died in police custody just up the road in Brixton, the kidnap and killing of Sarah Everard last year, the levels of disproportionate stop and search, and the police’s frequently denialist approach to accusations of institutional racism and misogyny, this is unsurprising. This fatal shooting, and their handling of it, will do nothing to restore shattered confidence.\nPart of the problem is when IOPC investigations take place, they don’t release any information, so as not to prejudice the investigation. But unfortunately, the media doesn’t seem to think about that when they put things out.\nSome in the media are talking about things that may have happened in Chris’ past, and not his present. His present was that he was going to be a father in November. He was getting married early next year, and he had begun an architecture apprenticeship. The press have said he was a drill artist, as if that’s a way of justifying why he may have found himself in that situation, or that he’d been arrested before. But we have to realise that with our justice system, if you’re Black, from a working-class background, you’re more likely to go to jail. Largely negative information has been put out about Chris, and not about what’s happened on the police’s side.\nThe police and IOPC have to listen to families and communities. There are lots of different community groups that form when incidents like this happen, and yes, the police have conversations with them, but are they really listening? This is not the first time a Black man has been shot by the police. We know that. So why are they not changing their behaviour?\nThe community in Streatham are obviously completely distraught. There’s a lot of collective grief. But sometimes we can lose sight of the fact that there is a family grieving. While highlighting the issues that surround Chris’ death, it’s important to remember that he is the one who has died, and that his family are the ones who are grieving. We should respect their wishes at every turn.\nThis article was first published by Gal Dem on the 9th September 2022.",

It reflects the long-term weaknesses and failings of a society hollowed out by decades of privatisation and austerity where the vast majority of us have been squeezed out in service of enriching the one per cent.\nResearch from the New Economy Foundation found that disposable income had fallen by £110 for the poorest half of our society since the last election even before the Government lifted the energy price cap. In the same period, the richest five per cent saw their own fortunes grow by £3,300.\nLast month’s Spring Statement will do nothing to alter the trajectory of increasing inequality and poverty in our country. Average energy bills are increasing by an average of 54 per cent. Average wages are not. The Government is permitting oil and gas producers to continue making record profits from the very price rises which are making life miserable for everyone else.\nInstead of levying a windfall tax to move the energy bills burden away from struggling households who cannot afford to pay onto profitable companies and shareholders who can, the Government is pushing 1.3 million more people into absolute poverty. Even as our Chancellor defended his murky tax arrangements last week, he was increasing everyone else’s and delivering the biggest real terms cut to welfare in 50 years.\nThe possible £20 million avoided by the Chancellor’s own wife is a desperate reminder that we need to close these tax loopholes and make sure the rich pay the same share of tax as the rest of us. As well as a Chancellor who exploits the tax loopholes he’s meant to close, we also now have a Prime Minister who broke his own lockdown rules. One rule for them, another for everyone else has long been the Tory party rallying cry but this has to be the most corrupt Tory Government of my lifetime.\nThe upcoming local elections are an opportunity for people to show exactly what they think of the people in charge of our country. But they are also a chance to vote for candidates who will fight for the support people need to weather the coming Tory storm and rebuild the foundations. Our councils have a key role to play in protecting our local environment, making our area safer for everyone to live in, delivering quality homes for residents (including new council homes), making our area safer for women and girls and working to build wealth in our community.

After months of scandals and cover ups, he announced will be leaving office in Autumn and not before time.\nBut Johnson’s premiership has shown the true face of the Conservative Party, with Tory Ministers and MPs overwhelmingly prepared to tolerate his corruption until they realised quite how unpopular this was with the public. I don’t envy his replacement, who will surely have to explain why they chose to back him in the face of Downing Street’s lockdown parties, ripping up rules and standards to try and secure his position, turning a blind eye to abuse, and the rampant culture of abuse, deception and corruption which has characterised this Government so far.\nOf course, this all comes at the worst possible time. With energy bills rising to almost £3,000 this Autumn, people can’t afford to sit around waiting whilst the Tories fight like rats in a sack for the top job. If they can’t govern because they’re in total disarray, then they must stand down and make way for those who can.\nDuring the last two years, British billionaires increased their wealth by £220 million a day. On current progress, 1.3 million people living in the UK are set to fall into absolute poverty next year. That’s a legacy no Tory leader is going to reverse because the billionaires are the people who bankroll them.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_stop-the-nhs-data-grab/content_687.html": "The Government recently tried to rush through a massive upload of our sensitive healthcare data. On the 12th of May, they announced that the medical records of 61 million NHS England service users were set to be centralised into a new database as part of a scheme called the General Practice Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR) on the 23rd of June.\nThankfully, after a strong backlash, the NHS Data Grab has been pushed back until the 30th of August, giving patients until then to opt out and giving us a little more time to raise awareness around the issue.\nWhat’s the problem?\nAccording to NHS Digital, this data will be used to: inform and develop health and social care policy, plan and commission health and care services, take steps to protect public health such as managing the Covid-19 pandemic, enable research, and provide individual care in exceptional cases.\nWe should be clear that patient data can be incredibly useful and beneficial when used for these purposes with informed consent, but we should be equally clear that the use of such data should only ever be happening with informed consent. The NHS Data Grab is not that.\nQuite apart from the reckless speed of the whole process, I have a number of concerns about the overall proposal, which hinges on three main issues. Firstly, the fact that the data will be pseudonymised but not anonymised, meaning someone could find out the name of the person the record belongs to. Secondly, the fact the Government refuses to clarify exactly how this sensitive data will be use and has failed to rule out indirectly selling it on to private companies. And thirdly, that the lack of transparency around the whole process risks undermining doctor-patient trust.\nIf a person’s data is not anonymised, there is a very strong risk they may not be willing to open up to their GP about issues they are experiencing and may undermine trust more generally.\nGiven that so far, information about this has only been shared online, there is a very real risk that many people with digital access issues – the elderly, the disabled, households without home internet access and those who do not have English as their first language in particular – cannot possibly have been given a chance to opt out.\nI am also concerned to see that Palantir is being considered for a large role in data management.\nPatient data should only ever be used in the public interest with informed consent, not exploited for corporate profit with minimal transparency. I’ll keep pushing to try and ensure they come up with a new proposal that reflects this and will call on the Government to stop the sell-off of our health data, ensure trust in GPs, protect patient confidentiality for the long term, and embark on a data protection impact assessment.\nIf you have any further questions about the NHS data grab, feel free to get in touch with my office: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk",

I believe that judicious, evidence-based stop and search can play a role in keeping us safe. But suspicionless stop and search powers are clearly counter-productive. There is very little concrete evidence to suggest they do much to keep us safe but plenty to show how disproportionately they are deployed.\nAs I pointed out in my intervention, this decision will do nothing to repair strained relations between people and the police.

Less than a year since this takeover, a BBC Panorama investigation revealed staff shortages, underqualified medical and administrative staff, and major referral backlogs at surgeries taken under Centene’s control.\nIt’s a story that shows two things: firstly, that the corporate takeover of our health services under the Tories is not some distant threat, but the present reality; and secondly, that when the Government sells off our essential health services, the only winners are shareholders.\nWith cuts to GP funding under successive Tory administrations, we’ve seen the number of GPs in England drop to 4,500 over the past decade and lost 300 GP practices in England since the last General Election alone. The Government doesn’t seem to have a plan to address this; just to leave a smaller pool of GPs to deal with a growing number of appointments.\nThere’s no denying that the pandemic has placed a huge strain on the NHS, especially with this Government’s willingness to run it beyond capacity as they let the virus run rampant. But the pandemic has been an object lesson in what happens when a Government is more interested in selling off the services they were elected to run than they are in running them: from the shambles that was Test and Trace to the dodgy PPE contracts proffered to highly-suspect companies.\nIt’s not just the insult of shovelling public money into corporate coffers for a substandard service that undercuts workers. These are matters of life and death. NHS waiting lists have soared from 2.5 million in 2010 when Labour left office, to 6.5 million this year and 117,000 people died waiting for NHS care last year. A recent Oxford University study revealed what front line doctors have been warning about for a long time: that increased for-profit outsourcing in our NHS has led to an increase in avoidable deaths.\nWe simply cannot afford this Government’s damaging agenda of privatisation and underfunding anymore. As we celebrate 74 years of our NHS this week, we must keep working to defend and extend the founding principles of universalism and public ownership that underpin it. Let’s say loud and clear that our NHS is not for sale.\nThis article was first published in the South London Press on the 7th July 2022.",

This is not a coincidence. After twelve years of Tory rule, the UK is the now most gas dependent country in Western Europe with the leakiest, draughtiest homes to boot.\nThese two facts are inseparable from the policies of the de facto party of state, which has consistently focused on rewarding its political and donor bases whilst putting off action on global challenges: from energy resilience to pandemics and the climate emergency.\nDavid Cameron’s declaration that he was “cutting the Green crap” ushered in an era of myopic policy choices which are now proving disastrous: slashing investment in renewables, scrapping the zero carbon homes initiative for new builds, failing to deliver on retrofitting, subsidising fossil fuel producers and inexcusably refusing to build new onshore wind power. If we hadn’t done this, our gas imports would be 13% lower according to recent analysis by Carbon Brief – a saving of £5 billion.\nWe need to keep shouting about this and making it clear that the cost of living emergency we’re facing didn’t fall from the sky but has been engineered by twelve years of Tory policy choices. It is a scandal precipitated by an unprecedented transfer of wealth to the very richest in our society in the name of trickle-down economics.\nLuckily, the Tories are making this very clear to us right now. The one redeeming feature of their latest budget is its clarification of exactly who they really represent: lower corporation tax rates, uncapping bankers’ bonuses whilst failing to rule out further benefits cuts, tax cuts for people who live off shares and stocks.\nAll this has created a crisis within a crisis which is wrecking the economy for all but the very richest with prices soaring, mortgages rising or being withdrawn, and the Bank of England having to shell out £65 billion (so far) to keep pension funds afloat.\nThe Tories failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining. Now they’re pissing on us and telling us it’s raining.\nNot even the financial markets or the right-wing press have confidence in this budget, a fact that reflects not only its dismal prospects for growth but also a latent anxiety that the Tories really are giving away the game.\nAnd no one voted for most of the things they are trying to do, there was no mention of tax cuts for the rich, more austerity, rolling back workers’ rights, or restarting fracking in their 2019 manifesto. Just 81,000 Conservative Party members put Liz Truss and her right-wing ideas into Downing Street. If she wants a mandate for these things, she needs to go back to the country and get one.\nAs the screeching u-turns leave us right back where we started, with millions of people struggling, we need to fight for an alternative for the millions, not the millionaires. That means fighting for transformative policies that will improve people’s lives, staying in Labour and putting pressure on the leadership to go further.\nIt means public investment that pays for itself instead of unfunded tax giveaways for the super rich.\nIt means ending our dependency on dangerous and dirty fossil fuels which fluctuate in price.\nIt means recognising that the cheapest energy is the energy we don’t use and launching a big home insulation programme.\nIt means windfall taxes on energy companies that last as long as the windfalls themselves.\nIt means taking suppliers into public ownership to ensure that suppliers are not extracting huge profits whilst energy prices are low only to turn to the public again when prices rise.\nIt means standing with our trade unions on the picket lines as they fight for real pay rises.\nIt means resisting efforts to play the working class off against itself whilst the rich get richer with attacks on migrants and people of colour.\nBut above all, it means booting out this Tory Government which will always put its rich mates ahead of delivering growth for the many and tackling the major issues of our time.\nThis article was first published by Labour Outlook on the 14th October 2022.",

During the pandemic, the government set up several secretive Whitehall units under the guise of monitoring Covid disinformation. It’s subsequently become clear that the remit of these units went well beyond this, logging the social media posts of journalists, campaigners, politicians (including myself), and members of the public.\nThe Government has put out contradictory statements about whether or not this particular unit has collected information on British citizens. So I asked the Defence Secretary to clarify the situation. The answer I got sounded like a yes; although he seemed to imply in his answer that myself and other colleagues are state actors. Either way, this is a misuse of resources for authoritarian ends.

It’s been a personal honour to represent my home and take on the role of Shadow Immigration Secretary.\nOf course, both jobs have not been without their difficulties. We are better for the diverse society we live in but there are always those seeking to create hatred and division. After last month’s terror attack it was heartening to witness the bonds of solidarity that exist in our community along with our powerful refusal to be ruled by fear.\nBut five more years of Tory rule is devastating for communities like ours. Whether it’s deporting people who’ve been here since childhood, splitting up families, giving more money to the shady private companies running its hostile environment, or denying Windrush victims a just compensation settlement, this Government has been busy causing further pain and suffering.\nBeyond the obvious and overwhelming human cost of these policies, recent immigration proposals are impractical and would only cause deeper damage to our public services. Since the Tory leadership hustings, Boris Johnson has been trailing around neglected industrial towns arguing that people should “speak in English”. But implementing these “standards” means adopting the kind of testing protocol which once led to native-English speaking Australian nurses being blocked from working in the NHS.\nResearch has repeatedly shown migrants are a net benefit to the economy, so the Tories’ new immigration system can only be an attempt to displace public attention away from the real economic issues facing working people in this country: stagnant wages, soaring living costs, and declining public services.\nSince the General Election, the Home Office has lurched from crisis to crisis. It’s clear the logic that led to the Windrush Scandal still holds sway. The worst detention centres remain open, people who have lived most of their lives in the UK are still being deported, EU citizens are being treated abysmally and all the while, the Government continues to deny Windrush victims a just compensation settlement.\nWe must never forget the sacrifice of a generation of Windrush workers who rebuilt this country after the war, or how they and others like them have been mistreated under successive governments. Equally, we must never stop fighting for a fairer world and a migration system that puts values, not numbers at its heart.\nThis article first appeared as a column in the South London Press on Friday 6th March 2020.",

I was told by staff that they’ve gone from happening once a month to being a weekly feature.\nIt’s worth noting that the clinic offers a range of services, including contraception. Seeking an abortion can be a difficult decision that comes with unnecessary shame and stigma and having to pass through a gauntlet of people only makes one of the hardest days of a woman’s life even harder.\nThat’s why I’ve called on Lambeth Council to implement a buffer zone outside the clinic. Legislation that would introduce these as a matter of course is currently making its way through Parliament. But the escalation of anti-abortion demonstrations outside our local clinic in the wake of the US Supreme Court decision to roll back abortion rights makes it all the more pressing for us to get the ball rolling on this.

Like Nadhim Zahawi and Gavin Williamson before him, Sunak would have had some understanding of the allegations against Raab. Once again, his decision to appoint someone in spite of this undermines his claim to integrity, professionalism and accountability. But this is the same party and personnel who closed ranks around Boris Johnson in the wake of Partygate and around the likes of Chris Pincher. Nothing has really changed in the Tory ranks.\n|\n|\nCommunity Safety Update\n|\n|\nI was devastated to hear about the fatal stabbing of Filipe Oliveira in Tulse Hill over the weekend at the age of just 20 years old.

I’ll be raising this with local police leadership in our next meeting, asking them about plans to keep young people safe in our community.\nI’ll keep pushing the Government to fund the interventions that get to the root causes of this violence: whether it’s reversing cuts and investing in youth services, addressing school exclusions, or a clearer focus on community policing.\n|\n|\nWomen and Equalities Committee: Black Maternal Health Inquiry\n|\n|\nOn the 17th of April, the Women and Equalities Committee published a report on black maternal health recognising and addressing how to tackle disparities in maternity care. The latest Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity found Black women are 3.7 times, Asian women 1.8 times, and women living in deprived areas 2.5 times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth. This report finds the government has known about the lethal health inequalities facing Black mothers for 20 years and have failed to make meaningful progress on eliminating them. It calls for a clear, measurable, and binding target to end these disparities. If we are going to change the fact that Black women in the UK are four times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth, the Government must also acknowledge racism as a driving factor and start properly resourcing the solutions they have announced.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n30th Anniversary of Stephen Lawrence’s Murder\n|\n|\nOn the 22nd of April 1993, teenager Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racially motivated attack while waiting for the bus in Southeast London.

Years later in 1998, the case was reopened after a public inquiry into his murder, which led to the publication of the Macpherson Report and changed the criminal justice system in Britain forever. Since the release of this report there have been changes to attitudes towards racism, the law, and the police. This week I joined Doreen Lawrence, Keir Starmer, and activists at a Labour event celebrating Stephen Lawrence’s life and his family’s powerful fight for justice thirty years after his murder.

After last week’s Ofgem announcement that average households will pay £690 more from April, their last-minute response doesn’t touch the sides of what is needed.\n£350 doesn’t even make up for the £355 the average pensioner household will lose out on this year, let alone the £1,040 cut to Universal Credit. And no matter how our Klarna Chancellor tries to spin it, the bulk of this buy now, pay later loan scheme is funded by the taxpayer, leaving us on the hook further down the line.\nAll but the very richest will be left feeling the pinch but the impact on the most vulnerable will be absolutely devastating, with the number of households facing fuel poverty rising to one in four.

Even with the Government’s last-minute loans and council tax rebates, we will see average energy bills rise by about 30 per cent. In France, bills are only going up by four per cent because they own the company that supplies their energy (and lots of ours).\nOn the same day the Government voted against Labour’s proposal for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies – who are doing very well out of the current crisis – Shell reported a 14-fold profit increase.

The “Minimum Service Levels” Bill would give the Government carte blanche to force striking workers into their workplaces, with workers facing the sack if they fail to comply.\nThey clapped for them. Now they want to sack them. The Tories claim this is about delivering minimum standards but after 13 years of underfunding, privatisation, and mismanagement, they are failing to deliver minimum standards in healthcare, education and transport on a daily basis. This is partly why we’re seeing strikes in the first place, driven by the strain this has placed on the underpaid workers propping up our crumbling public services.\nJust look at the situation in our NHS. Over the festive period, a dozen NHS trusts declared critical incidents. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine reported that between 300 and 500 people were dying every week due to delays in emergency care. The 133,446 NHS vacancies are a driving factor behind the current crisis and NHS strike action, with a continuing exodus of frontline medical staff. If passed, this legislation is likely to force out many of the nurses, paramedics and junior doctors currently holding our health service together.\nToo often, we are asked whether we can afford to pay NHS staff properly. The truth is we can’t afford not to pay them properly. With our NHS in crisis and staff leaving in droves over low pay, any Government that truly cared about upholding basic levels of services would be looking to negotiate a long-term pay settlement. These plans are nearly as unworkable as they are anti-worker.\nIs it any surprise people are struggling to see GPs, waiting longer for treatment, and experiencing lethal ambulance delays when the Tories seem to believe you can have a functioning NHS staff without any staff? This principle applies across our public services, where striking workers are fighting for the future of the services we all rely on. Sadly, the Tories are more interested in stopping public service workers from demanding minimum standards than they are in delivering them.\nThis forced pay cuts bill will do nothing to improve standards or staffing levels in our public services. What would?

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_constituency-newsletter-19th-april-2024/content_500.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n19th April 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThis week, Rishi Sunak declared his intention to pare back state support for disabled people and those with mental health conditions: those “feeling a little bit depressed” as he condescendingly put it. From December 2022-2023, the number of people receiving Universal Credit for a health condition or disability in Streatham grew by 555. Rising numbers are not the result of youth idleness or a snowflake mental health culture, as the Tories are desperate to tell us. They are primarily the result of NHS waiting lists trebling since the Tories took office and their failure to expand our limited public mental healthcare provision to cope with a mental health crisis.\nPeople who require physical and mental healthcare to get back to work are not receiving it. The rising number of claimants also reflects the increased socioeconomic pressure facing people in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, who face rising rents, mortgages, energy, childcare, food, and other basics. But the Tories are desperate to blame anyone but themselves for the situation we’re in and push ahead with deeper cuts so they’re hitting the scapegoat button again.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVoting against Rwanda Deportations\n|\nThe government’s Bill to force its Rwanda Deportation Scheme through the courts was back before MPs this week for consideration of amendments from the House of Lords. I voted for several amendments that would have upheld international law, checked whether Rwanda complies with treaty obligations, and stopped victims of modern slavery being deported – among other things.\nThe number of legal protections this legislation seeks to demolish only emphasises that what is being proposed is a form of state-sanctioned people trafficking. Treating people who have fled conflict, persecution and poverty in this way brings shame on our country. That is before we get into the likely expense involved in such plans, which come in at around £150,000 per deportee.\nThe biggest beneficiaries of these plans are the Tory Party, who need scapegoats for the country’s problems, and the outsourcing companies who stand to make millions from Home Office contracts. It’s not too late to drop these cruel and costly plans and devise a fairer asylum system centred on compassion, solidarity and human rights.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPushing for Peace in Gaza\n|\n|\nThe war in Gaza has now entered its sixth month. On Wednesday evening, I spoke at a PSC rally outside Parliament to urge our government to stop arming Israel and start calling for a ceasefire. 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s attack on October 7th last year. In the first six months of this conflict, we have seen this number of Palestinians being killed every single week. We are long past the point where this onslaught can be justified as self-defence.\nI joined Palestine Solidarity UK, War on Want, Campaign Against Arms Trade and several of my colleagues to hand in a petition to Downing Street, urging the government to stop UK arms sales to Israel. 67,000+ people signed this petition, demanding an end to our country’s complicity in the death and suffering of Palestinians. We must be completely and unequivocally sure that our weapons are not involved in any military action that may be in breach of international law.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nRemembering the Brixton Nail Bombings 25 Years On\n|\n|\nThis week, our community commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Brixton nail bombings. On the 17th April 2024, the first of three explosions took place on Electric Avenue, blowing out windows, blasting nearby cars and injuring some 48 people. Brixton was targeted because it was (and remains) a diverse community with a large Black population. The neo-Nazi terrorist who conducted these bombings said he wanted to “start a racial war”.\nThe two subsequent bombings saw the Asian community in Brick Lane and the LGBTQ+ community in Soho targeted, with four people losing their lives in the latter explosion. The aim of terror incidents like these is always to divide communities and strike fear into people’s hearts for simply being who they are. As we remember those killed and injured in these blasts, we must remember the threat still posed by the far right and that the only way to combat it is with cross-community solidarity.\n|\n|\nAutism Awareness and Acceptance Exhibition\n|\n|\nI was pleased to be invited by the GUBA (Grow, Unite, Build, Africa) foundation to a special preview of their Autism Awareness and Acceptance Exhibition. The exhibition celebrated the talent of autistic artists and challenged stigma associated with the condition, including in the Black community. I was especially proud to see the work of the headline artist Ama Amponsah who is only 11 years old with so much talent and has a bright future ahead.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nHope for Justice Conference: Transforming our Approach to Policing\n|\n|\nI was glad to be invited to speak the Hope for Justice conference hosted at Bloomsbury Baptist Church last weekend. The focus of the conference was reforming and transforming the police and criminal justice system. The conference examined this issue through the lens of the Black community but also through a Christian perspective. It is no secret that our criminal justice system disproportionately targets and negatively impacts members of the Black community. Black people are over-represented in prison populations and racially profiled by police. Years of calling for change has led to limited impact, which is why we need to keep advancing conversations such as these. I will continue to fight and campaign for justice and equity in our police and justice system.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVisiting Carers’ Common Room\n|\n|\nIt was lovely to pay a visit to Carers’ Common Room on Friday afternoon, a prototype space for care workers to use between visits to clients. It is a comfy and relaxing environment where care workers can eat, drink, relax, and, crucially, come together. Care work is not just undervalued and underpaid in our society, it can also be isolating. Carers’ Common Room also offers opportunities for their mostly women workforce to upskill, gain knowledge and enjoy themselves. It is clear how much work and care has gone into creating this community. I hope it can continue beyond this month, when it closes its doors in International House.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nCelebrating 200 years of Trinity Almshouses\n|\n|\nFor 200 years, Trinity Home Almshouses has provided shelter, community and respite to people in our area. It was a pleasure to join Thursday evening’s bicentenary celebrations as they launched an exhibition celebrating this work at the newly opened Lambeth Archives. Thank you to the photographer, Jim Grover, for putting on an amazing exhibition and for the copy of the exhibition book. Behind the Blue Doors can be seen in the exhibition gallery of the newly opened Lambeth Archives in Brixton until 1 June.\n|\n|\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_protect-our-politics-from-super-rich-donors/content_87.html": "In a parliamentary debate on the issue of political donations, I argued that we must tighten up the rules to protect our politics from dark money and the corrupting influence of the super rich.\nFor every £10 donated to UK political parties since the early 2000s, £1 came from dubious sources. 20% of all donations over a similar period came from just 10 men.\nIt clearly suited the last government to let big money flood our politics. Not only did they strip the Electoral Commission of its ability to prosecute criminal offences and place it under ministerial control; they also raised campaign spending limits. It was their last lifeline but not even this could save them from electoral oblivion.\nIndeed, I pointed out that wealthy people are not giving huge sums of money to political parties purely out of the goodness of their hearts; they do it to buy policy influence.\nIf we want to create a democratic system where everyone’s vote has equal value, then we need stronger protections in place to prevent the very richest in our society from bending our politics in their own interest. After a decade which saw billionaire party donors treble their wealth whilst working people saw the biggest pay squeeze since the Napoleonic Wars, we need change.",

This legislation will effectively restore rail operating companies to public ownership over the next few years, as franchise contracts expire. We are taking the money paid to shareholders and ploughing it back into our railways for the benefit of all.\nThere is still work to be done if we are to end profiteering on our railways and deliver the best value for passengers. As long as the companies that lease rolling stock remain in private hands, passengers will pay more so these companies can pay their shareholders. It should be a Labour ambition to buy and own our trains directly too.",

But because their privilege and processes seem designed to stop them facing the consequences of their actions, we are stuck in a groundhog day of revelations without repercussions. I wrote about what the revelations that a Tory MP has been caught watching porn in Parliament show about our system.\n|\n|\n|\nThe end of the current session of Parliament saw the passage of several bills that have very worrying implications for our rights and freedoms: a Policing Bill that curbs our right to protest, an Elections Bill designed to supress voter turnout, a Judicial Review Bill that gives the government powers to overrule the courts, and a Nationality and Borders Bill that criminalises people for seeking safety in the UK. I fought tooth and nail to prevent these bills from passing, laying down amendments to throw out the Policing Bill and supporting and tabling amendments to strip the worst elements out of the others.\n|\n|\nProtesting the Policing Bill when it was first before Parliament in March 2021\n|\nI know from the floods of emails I received in my inbox urging me to vote against these bills and strip out draconian provisions, that these aren’t the values of people in Streatham. We need to recognise that the attempt to silence, marginalise, and ostracise people fundamentally comes from a place of weakness, and ultimately, fear, and that hope is stronger than fear. It falls on us to stand together and stand up for the right to call for change, overcome voter suppression tactics, and keep welcoming refugees into our community.\n|\n|\n|\nIn Streatham\nLittle Village Donation Drive\n|\n|\nWe had a very successful morning at St Margaret’s Hub collecting several van loads of pre-loved baby equipment for baby bank Little Village, who support families in our area. I’d like to say a massive thank you to the people who donated hundreds of items and to all the brilliant volunteers who sorted, packed and delivered donations. I’d also like to send special thanks to Mosaic Clubhouse for lending us their community van for the morning.\n|\n|\nSince the beginning of 2020, Little Village have responded to 919 requests for help from Lambeth families. They are still running low on many essential items, such as beds, buggies and clothes for the high number of families that need support. With 98% of baby banks expecting 2022 to be their busiest year yet, it’s really important that we do what we can do support those plugging gaps left by Tory cuts and austerity. If you couldn’t make it along last weekend, please feel free to drop any smaller pre-loved baby items (for 0-5 year olds) at my constituency office over the next few days: 218 Brixton Hill (SW2 1HE).\nVisiting Bishop Thomas Grant School\n|\n|\nIt was brilliant to join Bishop Thomas Grant Sixth Form Students this week to talk about my role as their MP and answer questions about our political system. They asked me some insightful and incisive questions about everything from knife crime to tuition fees, the cost of living crisis and lowering the voting age. It’s really important to encourage our young people to participate in the democratic process and clarify the power they have as citizens.\nSupporting Residents at St Giles House\n|\n|\nLast week, I visited residents at St Giles House who’ve been dealing with a number of issues. An elderly resident recently had her bag stolen outside the front door of the building, losing her front door key and key fob to access the building in the process. Sanctuary, her housing provider, replaced her front door lock but failed to reprogram the key fobs for the whole building, leaving residents potentially compromised.\nOn my visit, I was made aware of several other issues that Sanctuary had failed to address, including a serious leak that has been going on since before Christmas. The floor was so wet when I visited that it went through my shoes. The group of primarily elderly residents who live there have effectively been left to manage this for themselves. I’m in contact with Sanctuary Housing urging them to address these problems and St Giles residents’ other issues as a matter of priority.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBack in Parliament\nBlack Maternal Health – From Awareness to Action\n|\n|\nIn September last year, I joined Five X More to found the All Party-Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Black Maternal Health. This week saw our first public meeting in Parliament as we discussed the progress made since Five X More founders Clotilde Abe and Atinuke Awe first launched their campaign in 2018.\nOne panellist put it perfectly: “we’ve raised awareness, we need action.” We know about the suboptimal conditions and barriers Black women and birthing people face in maternity care. We know that Black women feel the impact of chronic NHS midwifery shortages and retention difficulties most acutely. We need a commitment from the Government to set a binding target to tackle the crisis in NHS midwifery and end these lethal health inequalities.\n|\n|\nCut Visa Fees Now\n|\n|\nIt was great to chair the official launch of Migrant Voice’s report on building a fairer visa renewal system this week. The financial burdens and stress around the process have a damaging impact on every area of migrants’ lives: from their personal finances to their employment, their relationships, their quality of life, and their children’s prospects. Covid and the cost of living crisis are only exacerbating these issues. With some visas charged at seven times the admin cost, we need to cut fees and create a more compassionate system to stop people being driven into deprivation and exploitation.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLower the Voting Age\n|\n|\nI met with the APPG on Votes at 16 this week to support their campaign to lower the voting age. Our democracy is at its best when it involves everyone and encourages people to have their say. In my work as an MP, I’m passionate about teaching our kids about the power they have as citizens. Young people deserve a say on the decisions that influence their lives. It’s our responsibility to encourage them to participate in our democracy. We shouldn’t keep them locked out.\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

The Republican-dominated Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs Wade in the USA last year was a reminder that we can never consider these truly safe from right-wing ideologues. This attack on reproductive rights comes at a political moment when conservatives across the world are attempting to reassert traditional power structures as their right-wing economic project comes under increased strain.\n“If we are going to build a more equal world for all women, we need to recognise that our oppression is connected, so our struggle must be too.”\nTo talk about culture wars as a “distraction”, fails to recognise their deeper purpose. It’s not simply about pointing the finger away from the unfolding catastrophe of soaring living costs, falling pay, and crumbling public service provision; it’s about making it harder to challenge the status quo by taking away people’s rights.\nPatriarchy, racism, ableism and imperialism are all mutually reinforcing. If we are going to build a more equal world for all women, we need to recognise that our oppression is connected, so our struggle must be too. The theme of this year’s International Women’s Month is “embracing equity”. It encourages us to understand that women start from different places, so true equality requires us to acknowledge the diverse experiences and conditions of different women. As Flavia Dzodan said: “my feminism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit”. There is no place for a feminism that seeks to exclude or marginalise racialised women, disabled women, or our trans siblings.\nWhilst the issue of abortion is not polarised along party political lines in the same way as it is in the USA, we shouldn’t be fooled into thinking it can’t happen here. We have a Government that is almost singularly focused on ripping up legislation enshrining our rights and specifically legislating to undermined the right to protest, strike, vote, and claim asylum. And the presence of Tory MPs like Jacob Rees-Mogg, who recently called abortion a “cult of death”, and Danny Kruger, who contends that the question of whether women can access reproductive healthcare is “a proper topic for political debate”, is a reminder that our right to choose is never safe from the political Right.\nDuring my time in Parliament, we have seen important steps to extend the right to abortion, MPs voting to introduce telemedical abortion and buffer zones outside clinics – both issues which split the Tory Party. But as women wait weeks to access reproductive healthcare or are forced to travel hundreds of miles to seek a surgical abortion, it’s clear that this right is being eroded by the Government’s attempts to run our NHS into the ground and undermine the provision of universal healthcare.\nThe current crisis in our NHS is damaging for everyone trying to access healthcare. The consequences for those at the bottom of the priority list are more serious still. This reflects the way cuts and austerity have consistently fallen heaviest on women, and particularly racially minoritised, disabled, and trans women.\nAs the writer Shon Faye says, “if you have a body that is in any way marginalised by the gender binary […] we have a state that is largely apathetic to your pain, both physical and emotional.” Women’s struggles to access abortion services, Black women’s appalling experiences of maternity care, the lack of adequate gender recognition services and disabled people’s unmet healthcare needs are all part of a bigger picture. Healthcare is a vital battleground but with the Government hell-bent on further disempowering the marginalised, there are so many other fights we have to take up together.\nThis International Women’s Month, I’m thinking of the fact that Black women are still four times more likely to die in pregnancy in childbirth.\nI’m thinking of Child Q, Sarah Everard, and the need to end the misogyny and sexual violence perpetrated by the police.\nI’m thinking of all the women refugees and trafficking victims who will be denied asylum if the Government gets away with its latest piece of violent anti-refugee legislation.\nI’m thinking of the migrant women denied access to the support they need by the hostile environment.\nI’m thinking about women in the Global South who face increased risk of hardship and gender violence because of climate breakdown and cuts to the aid budget.\nI’m thinking of Brianna Ghey, Sophie Gwen Williams, Alice Litman, and all the trans women whose lives have been cut short.\nI’m thinking of the disabled women whose freedom to get around will be disproportionately impacted if the Government manage get away with destaffing our rail network and closing down ticket offices.\nI’m thinking of the women who will be hit hard by another austerity budget this week.\nI’m thinking about how changing all of these things starts with embracing equity, standing together, recognising the connectedness of our struggles, and leaving no woman behind. We need to challenge the Tories’ scarcity mindset, where rights are a zero-sum game. Taking rights away from one oppressed group will never enhance the freedoms of another. In the fight for liberation, our solidarity cannot be selective.\nThis article was first published in Labour Outlook on 17th March 2023.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_being-an-mp-doesnt-make-any-difference-i-still-face-racism-in-the-workplace/content_419.html": "A study carried out by the broadcaster ITV has shown that almost two-thirds of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) MPs have experienced some form of racism while working in parliament. Not a single figure or piece of testimony from the survey shocked me – even though I am a brand new MP. Being an MP does not make us special. In reality, I am just another black person at work. I face racism and so do my colleagues.\nThere is a culture in parliament and the media that is largely unchanged by the fact of increased diversity. The tone and leadership regarding what is acceptable comes from the very top. And the top is rotten. Politicians and commentators pander to anti-immigrant rhetoric, with no regard for the fact that immigration in this country is synonymous with race. BAME MPs who challenge racism will hear in response, often on social media, that they are “race baiters”, are ignoring people’s “real concerns” and will be told “go back to where [they] came from”, and worse.\nTwo months into being an MP I have already experienced this personally, but as a staff member for Diane Abbott I watched it go on for years. It’s common for black members and staffers to be asked to produce their passes and be questioned on the parliamentary estate. I know one new member, a black woman, who had an MP hand her his bag and ask her to hold it for him. When working as Diane’s staffer, even in my early 30s I was asked if I was her niece or daughter, including by other MPs.\nAnd when a racist incident makes the news, the pattern is predictable: the establishment feigns shock about how awfully black people are treated, a few BAME MPs are pulled on the TV to talk about it. Wash, rinse, repeat. The prime minister’s spokesman’s refusal this week to condemn the views of a No 10 adviser who was found to have claimed that intelligence is linked to race shows just how deep these problems run.\nBoris Johnson’s own opinions are well known: take his appalling words comparing women wearing burkas to letterboxes or describing black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon” smiles. There should be no surprise when the rest of parliament and even the public treat BAME MPs this way.\nAs a result of the sexual abuse and bullying inquiry, all MPs are required to take “valuing everyone training”. MPs need similar training on racism and diversity. It is clear that some cannot grasp the issue for themselves.\nI am an anti-racist. I understand and accept that as long as discrimination exists in society and I am a minority in parliament I must challenge it. I am happy to do that. But that is an additional role not required of others: those who accept the rise in racism and discrimination.\nIn my maiden speech, when I spoke about the litany of injustices BAME people have faced in this country, I asked: “How can I be equal to every other member in the House of Commons when this is how it treats people who look like me?” The answer is simple, I am not. And as my colleagues have demonstrated in the responses to the survey, there is still a very long way to go before we are.\nThis article was first published in The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/18/black-minority-ethnic-mps-racism-abuse",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_19th-march-2023/content_603.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n19th March 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThis week, the Tories announced another austerity budget that does nothing to ease the burden on households struggling with the soaring cost of housing, heating, electricity, childcare, food, fuel, and other basics. The headline is that the average household will see their disposable income shrinking by record amounts over the next two years and public services will see a £22 billion stealth hit whilst high earners, corporations and motorists benefit from tax cuts.\nWe need to shift the burden away from ordinary households and onto the wealthiest. Instead of hammering public services, the Government needs to follow the money and address the vast inequalities that now exist in our economy. That could start with a stronger windfall tax on the oil and gas giants raking it in and closing tax loopholes like non-dom status.\n|\n|\nOpposing the Latest Tory Attack on Refugees\n|\n|\nThis week, I spoke out and voted against the Government’s latest legislative attack on some of the most vulnerable people in the world, also tabling a cross-party reasoned amendment to stop it in its tracks. People are no less deserving of human rights, dignity, or compassion because of the dangerous routes they have to take to reach safety. The Tories’“Illegal Migration Bill” is really a Ban Refugees Bill. They want to pretend that the majority of those making the crossing are not genuine refugees who will make successful claims; and recast them as illegal migrants.\nThis legislation would see people who’ve escaped some of the most horrific conditions denied safety, detained, and deported. As the damage wrought by thirteen devastating years of right-wing policies becomes clearer and clearer, the Tories are sinking deeper into their last redoubt: racism and scapegoating. In a world where a tiny minority of displaced people end up in Britain, we need to treat those who do with care and compassion. People who’ve escaped some of the worst horrors shouldn’t have to risk their lives again just to reach safety. We need viable safe routes, not another blatant attack on refugees to divide and distract communities.\n|\n|\nStanding With Striking Workers\n|\n|\nOn a day when 500,000 public service workers were on strike to fight for fair pay, Wednesday’s budget brought no plan to repair our crumbling public services or reverse years of low pay for the workers struggling to hold them together. I was proud to stand on the picket lines with junior doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital and Streatham Job Centre staff to show my solidarity.\n|\n|\nThis week’s improved pay offer to nurses, ambulance workers, and other health staff shows the strikes are having their desired effect. The Government’s tax cuts show us that there is money out there to repair public services and pay the workers who keep them running properly. And there is plenty more money sloshing around in corporate coffers and the bank accounts of the very richest.\n|\n|\nMeeting with Lambeth Peer Action Collective to Discuss Youth Safety\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday, Lambeth Peer Action Collective came to Parliament last night to meet their MPs (myself, Florence Eshalomi MP and Helen Hayes MP) and discuss how we can make our community a safer place to live in, for everyone. It was great to hear young people arguing passionately for better social supports: from decent housing to better mental health services, an end to school exclusions, well-funded and inclusive education and good job opportunities.\n|\n|\nResist Racism: Marching Against Hate\n|\n|\nI joined thousands of people yesterday to march through Westminster and mark UN Anti-Racism Day. As our public services and living standards get worse, so do the Tories’ attempts to divide and distract. They want people to blame refugees and migrants for the problems we are now facing, instead of their policies, which have failed to deliver for the majority of the country and mostly benefitted the richest 1%. We must continue standing against racism in all its forms if we are going to build a society that works for everyone.\n|\n|\nOne Year on From P&O: Ban Fire & Rehire\n|\n|\nOn March 17th 2022, 786 P&O Ferries crew members were sacked over Zoom and bundled off ships by masked security guards wielding handcuffs. Then-prime minister Boris Johnson promised to hold P&O accountable for its disgraceful treatment of seafarers. A year on, instead of sanctioning this unscrupulous company, the Government has legislated against the crew’s trade union. It’s very clear whose side the Tories are really on. This week, Labour outlined our plan to make it illegal for unscrupulous employers to fire workers only to re-engage them on worse terms.\n|\n|\nHosting Commonwealth Parliamentarians\n|\n|\nIt was a pleasure to welcome elected representatives from across the Commonwealth to the constituency on Friday to discuss the global challenges we are now facing. It was great to discuss the similarities and differences in our roles and give them a tour of our area. A big thank you to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for organising the event, to Madam Mayor, Councillor Pauline George, for hosting us at Lambeth Town Hall, and to Brixton Windmill for plying the delegates with tea, coffee, and cake made from locally ground flour.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

But we have to remember that our normal was rising levels of anti-Semitism and all forms of racism across the UK. I quoted 94-year-old Holocaust survivor Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who recently said that she hopes the coronavirus pandemic “will wake people up to have better attitudes towards each other”.\nThe atrocities of the Holocaust, and other past events, teach us that we must challenge prejudice and the language of hatred on a daily basis. We must condemn it when it marches across our streets. We must expose it when it tries to rear its head on online platforms. We must stamp it out when it seeks political legitimacy. When prejudice is reinforced and empowered, this threatens the very fabric of democracy.\nThe recent situation in the USA is a reminder of what happens when hatred and discrimination are left unchecked.

I called on Rishi Sunak to offer a formal government apology for Britain’s role in slavery and colonialism. He flat out refused, saying “no…trying to unpick our history is not the right way forwards”. But the racism and inequality that persists in the present has its roots in our colonial past. I firmly believe that the only way we can move forwards as a society is through a full and honest reckoning with the history that created the country, and indeed the world we live in today. The United Kingdom has never officially apologised for the suffering inflicted on people through the violence of the transatlantic slave trade and colonial rule. When we talk about reparations, people often try to reduce the conversation to a question of payments and large sums of money. But no quantity of money could put these evils right.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_cut-their-profits-not-our-station-ticket-offices/content_53.html": "Last week, rail companies announced plans to rush through the closure of almost every train station ticket office in the country. These cuts would be bad for passengers, workers, and accessible travel. They aren’t an attempt to modernise our railway network; they’re an attempt to shore up our ailing, failing privatised rail industry.\nOur train station ticket offices are so much more than a place to purchase tickets, acting as the first point of contact for disabled people seeking assisted travel and a central point of contact for passengers in general. They support passengers who cannot use machines, provide a place of safety for children separated from parents, offer ticketing advice to ensure maximum savings and prevent mis-booked tickets and so much more besides. They bring a human touch to our railways.\nThe main justification for these cuts from the Rail Delivery Group (the industry body representing train companies) is that only 1 in 8 rail journeys are now booked using ticket offices. Whilst it’s certainly true that people are gravitating towards new booking methods, this figure still represents a significant number of transactions. Disability activist Rachel Charlton-Dailey estimates that 118 million train journeys were facilitated by ticket offices in 2021-22 alone.\nDisabled activists are leading the charge against scrapping ticket office closures, rightly pointing out that this will make it harder for disabled people to purchase tickets, access assisted travel, and stay safe in stations.\nRail operators are already systematically failing to provide accessible travel. A leaked document from Govia Thameslink Railway last year showed that the company has been running driver-only operated trains at unstaffed stations, stopping disabled passengers from accessing turn up and go travel on the same terms as other passengers. Subsequent investigations by the Association of British Commuters revealed that six companies (GTR, GWR c2c, Greater Anglia, Southeastern, and Chiltern) operated staffing policies that denied disabled people turn up and go travel in breach of the public sector equality duty.\nThe rail industry and government claim these latest closures are simply a matter of moving staff out “from behind the glass” into the station at large. But train operators have already issued Section 188 notices informing staff that their jobs are at risk. Meanwhile, the government is refusing to offer any meaningful assurances on job security. With many already frequently failing to deliver assisted travel, it is very difficult to see how further cuts to staffing will do anything to improve accessibility – quite the opposite. It’s hard to see the government’s mantra of “modernisation” as anything other than a fig leaf for cuts that will deny more disabled people the same right to travel as everyone else.\nThe parlous state of our railways is a textbook example of why privatising a natural monopoly is a very bad idea. Rail is a relatively low margin industry, so entrusting it to companies with a fiduciary duty to deliver for shareholders invariably creates a situation where the only options are to hike fares and cut services to keep the dividends flowing.\nRail companies made £310 million in taxpayer-funded profits between March 2020 and September 2022: a period which coincided with a 22% reduction in overall service levels. That money alone would cover a £12,500 pay rise for every RMT member who has been on strike over the past year. As well as draining money out of our rail network and into shareholders’ pockets, privatisation has created a fragmented, dysfunctional and unaccountable system of provision. With the patchwork of companies involved in running our railways all focused on maximising their own returns, the current model has proven incapable of delivering an efficient, well planned, properly funded system for the long term.\nWith rail fares rising at twice the rate of wages since 2010, it’s becoming clearer and clearer that we pay more and more for less and less. In an age of climate breakdown, the money we spend on our railway network must be invested back into services and infrastructure if we are going to get people off the roads and onto cleaner public transport.\nWhen RMT members walk out on strike next week, they are not just fighting to protect ticket office jobs or stop their pay being eaten up by inflation; they are fighting for a railway system run for the benefit of the many, not the few. Instead of shoring up our privatised rail industry on the backs of passengers, disabled people, and staff, we need to take it into public ownership and boost funding.\nThis article was first published in Labour Outlook on the 14th July 2023.",

We toured the maternity unit to speak to staff about the issues they encounter on the job, many of which were all too familiar to me. Too many mothers and babies are not receiving the high standard of care they deserve, with two-thirds of maternity units in England deemed unsafe in the latest Care Quality Commission report. Sadly, traumatic birth experiences are becoming normalised in our healthcare system with mothers who are Black, Asian, or mixed race and women who live in deprived areas seeing particularly poor outcomes.\nMaternity staff told me that attrition rates among more experienced maternity staff are having a particular impact. This not only heaps the pressure on their colleagues who do stay but also leaves us with fewer seasoned midwives to support new staff coming through. Staff also highlighted the increased numbers of complex births coming through the wards.\nI have so much respect for staff, who are working so hard just to hold things together. When asked for one thing they would get politicians to address, they urged increased funding for mental health services, more investment in student nurses, standardised bereavement support across trusts, and support, investment, and respect for the maternity workforce.

With people facing sky-high bills, poverty wages, shoddy housing, and food poverty, it’s clear there is real suffering and anger in our society after twelve years of Tory rule for the wealthy few.\nInstead of changing course and doing something about this, they have tabled the Public Order Bill. This Bill tips the balance further against the need for protest and democratic expression, bringing back many of the worst features that were rejected when they passed the Policing, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Act.

Care4Calais have been doing an amazing job supporting refugees across London and immediately jumped into action to support those in the Dudley Hotel.\nI wrote to the Mayor of London asking for support in supplying these refugees with oyster cards to allow them access to travel and to the NHS South East London CCG asking for help registering many of the refugees with a GP surgery. In addition, I asked Lambeth Council for assistance in getting the 50 children at the hotel into local schools. Access to school places is vital to enable refugee children to learn English and feel more at home here in the UK. In addition, many of the hotels that refugees are held in do not have play facilities available,\nleaving the children with very little to do with their days. I am pleased that we are making some progress towards ensuring that these refugees are getting the support they need.\nUnfortunately, the situation in the Dudley Hotel points to wider problems with the UK’s asylum system and treatment of refugees. Of the several cases that have emerged from the hotel, the most pressing concern has been the suitability of their accommodation and the inadequate provision of food to suit their cultural and dietary needs. A substantial number of residents in the hotel are pregnant or are parenting younger children, many of them have raised concerns regarding the inadequate accommodation for their families, and many of them have raised health needs and requirements that have not been met by the hotel provision.\nToo often, refugees are housed in poor, unsuitable conditions, or placed in hotels and hostels with very little regard for their health, dietary, cultural and personal needs. The Government must seriously re-evaluate its treatment of refugees who make the perilous journey to the UK and subsequently suffer brutal mistreatment in the hostile environment.\nI also encountered issues trying to support people.

Sadly, instead of prioritising long-term investments to fix our crumbling NHS, schools, and other public services, they have chosen to take money out of future budgets for a pre-election giveaway to their base.\n|\n|\nThe headline measure from this cut and run budget was a 2p cut to National Insurance Contributions. For every £1 spent on NIC cuts, 46p will go to the richest households. Just 3p will go to the poorest. And every penny is money taken away from school, hospital, and council budgets, where it is so badly needed. Tax cuts are never free and do not pay for themselves, they are funded by spending cuts to vital public services and borrowing. Unprotected departments will see budgets cut by around 17% in the next Parliament.\nWe know that austerity has been disproportionately inflicted on Labour councils. Our local council’s core government funding has already been slashed by more than half since the Tories took power. We’ve seen libraries and children’s centres forced to close. The main impact of these cuts will be felt further down the line in further service reductions.\nThe cost-of-living crisis has gone nowhere and yet instead of helping those who are struggling, the Tories are giving tax breaks that mostly benefit the rich. Tory austerity has stagnated the economy and created higher living costs with no end in sight. Instead of treating economic growth as a pre-requisite for public investment, we need our government to treat public investment as a pre-requisite for economic growth.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nWe Need Policing Reform\n|\nThe last two weeks rightly put the spotlight back on the urgent need for policing reform. As we remembered Sarah Everard, killed and kidnapped in our community by a serving police officer three years ago, Phase One of the Angiolini Review was published. This report examined how Sarah’s killer, Wayne Couzens, was able to become and remain a police officer in spite of an extensive alleged history of serious sexual offences and predatory behaviour dating back over 20 years (including his time in the job). We also saw the release of a BBC documentary looking at Sarah’s murder, how this devastating crime unfolded, and its lasting impact on her loved ones and the country.\nToday also saw another important development, with the naming of the officer who shot and killed Chris Kaba in September 2022. His trial is scheduled to begin later this year, on the 1st of October. In any other murder trial, the accused would be named. There was no reason why this one should be any different. My thoughts and prayers are with Chris’s friends and family as their fight for justice continues.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nFare Freeze Campaigning\n|\n|\nI was lovely to be out on Monday talking to people at Clapham Common Station. Whilst the Tories let rail companies hit us with another huge fare hike, our Labour Mayor is freezing TfL fares this year for the fifth time since he was elected. This is the kind of difference that Labour in power can make, putting money back in people’s pockets, unlike our government who let profiteering train companies hike fares year after year.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nClapham Common Post Office Closes Its Doors\n|\n|\nI am gutted that the closure of Clapham Common Post Office went ahead this week despite our concerted community campaign to keep it open. We marched, wrote letters, signed petitions, answered consultations and campaigned for months to try and prevent this from happening. But sadly, our services have fallen victim to a mismanaged company that is desperately looking for money to fund compensation for the Horizon Scandal. Councillors will keep fighting for the Post Office to listen to local voices and open a replacement branch.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStreatham Wells LTN Suspended\n|\n|\nI was relieved to hear Lambeth Council has suspended the Streatham Wells LTN trial today in light of severe disruption to bus routes. Measures to encourage sustainable transport, cut traffic and emissions, and improve road safety are vital but this LTN wasn’t working in its current form. I welcome the announcement of new bus priority measures alongside the walking and cycling upgrades starting in a few months’ time. Look out for the consultations on these, which will be published in due course.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nWomen in Westminster: Making the 100 List\n|\n|\nI was pleased to be featured on this year’s Women in Westminster list and glad to attend an official announcement event this week, where we celebrated some of the work happening to fight for gender equality and create equal representation at every level of our politics.\nOnly with a parliament that believes in equal representation can we continue to make progress in women’s rights and women’s safety. So many women feel distrustful of the system and the police, feel unsafe to walk home unaccompanied and these fears are not baseless. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done and I’m proud to be one of the women in Parliament that voice these issues and concerns and hopefully bring about enduring change.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNo One’s Listening: Addressing Failures in Sickle Cell Care\n|\n|\nThis week marked 10 years since the death of my friend Adjuah Annan, who had sickle cell anaemia. Her untimely death at the age of just 28 was a direct result of serious failings in her care. Adjuah’s experiences and those of many others are outlined in the landmark Sickle Cell Society and APPG report, ‘No One’s Listening’.\nSince this report was published in 2021, the government has failed to meaningfully engage with it. 10 years after we lost Adjuah, countless others with Sickle Cell and Thalassemia are still experiencing substandard care, unequal treatment and, in some cases, lethal negligence. This week, I pushed the government on this ignored report, asking when they will implement its recommendations.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVisiting Streatham and Clapham High School\n|\n|\nIt was a pleasure to speak to the students at Streatham and Clapham High School in the run up to International Women’s Day. I was able to talk about my experience as a woman in Parliament but also encourage the girls to pursue their dreams and overcome male dominated industries, which we know can be intimidating to any young woman. We must keep striving for equality across the board at every level of our workplaces and our politics.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPushing for a Ban on Conversion Therapy\n|\n|\nI was in Parliament to support Lloyd Russell-Moyle MP’s private members bill to bring in a no loopholes ban on conversion practices. The government promised to ban these practices, which are tantamount to torture, years ago but Tory MPs stopped it from passing today. Conversion therapy is a reprehensible practice that continues to ruin people’s lives. In the five and a half years since the government pledged to end conversion practices, we have seen this proposed law watered down again and again and repeatedly shelved. The current iteration has little to no protection for trans people. We urgently need enforceable legislation to protect LGBTQ+ people.\n|\n|\nEnd UK Arms Sales to Israel\n|\n|\nI joined over 200 elected representatives from around the world to sign a declaration voicing our commitment to preventing our countries from exporting arms to Israel. This is something I have consistently pushed for – most recently in Zarah Sultana’s Westminster Hall debate on the issue [link]. Banning military exports to Israel is the absolute bare minimum the UK Government can do. We shouldn’t be doing supplying military hardware that is being used to kill civilians.\n|\n|\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|",

With RPI running above ten per cent, this is a massive real terms pay cut for the very people who made them this money and kept us all connected and supplied under the difficult and risky conditions of the pandemic. I’ve been supporting members of the Communications Workers Union in their dispute with Royal Mail again this month. If Royal Mail can’t operate without driving down workers’ pay and cutting jobs because their first priority is always paying shareholders, then that’s just another argument to take the service back into public ownership where it belongs – as Labour delegates unanimously voted for at this year’s party conference.\nSupporting Postal Workers\nShare this page",

Five years after the pandemic was officially declared, I joined people who lost loved ones to commemorate those who died, remember the sacrifice and care that guided us through the worst days of COVID-19 and vow to learn from government failures.

Its core recommendation is that remains should no longer be displayed in UK museums. It highlights clear ethical concerns around the display and holding of African ancestral remains in British museums and private collections. So many of these were acquired under colonial rule. They are not objects, but human beings deserving of respect and dignity. I hope the report will encourage museums, collectors and the government to work to respectfully repatriate African ancestral remains acquired under colonialism.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nA Library for Every Child in Every School\n|\n|\nOn Friday, I visited Clapham Manor School, where pupils have just started a book club as part of the National Literacy Trust’s ‘Libraries for Primaries’ campaign. It was great to hear from the pupil librarians about the ways in which reading is already enriching their lives. Sadly, one in four schools in the most disadvantaged communities do not have a library—one factor behind the declining number of kids reading for fun. I fully support efforts to end the postcode lottery and ensure every child has access to a proper library at school.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVisiting Stockwell Primary School\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIt was wonderful to start the week with a visit to Stockwell Primary School as part of their International Women’s Day learning. It was great to speak to pupils about my pathway into Parliament, the importance of representation in politics and what MPs actually do on a day-to-day basis.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThe Use and Abuse of Stop and Search\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday morning, I took part in a debate on the use of stop and search powers. As the government looks set to create new policing powers, I argued it is important to scrutinise their use of existing powers. I highlighted ongoing disproportionalities around the use of stop and search, which mean Black people are over four times more likely to be stopped and searched than their White counterparts.\n|\n|\n|\nI raised my continuing concern that the overuse of suspicionless stop and search powers is counterproductive. Searching people without evidence undoubtedly alienates those who are searched despite having done nothing wrong and undermines trust in policing among the public as a whole. Rather than helping the police to do their jobs and keep us safe, this actually undermines their ability to do so – particularly in my constituency.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAn Overdue Upgrade to Workers’ Rights\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday evening, Labour MPs voted through one of the biggest upgrades to workers’ rights for a long, long time. The Employment Rights Bill contains measures to ban zero hours contracts, extend statutory sick pay to millions of low-paid workers and reduce bureaucracy on trade unions. These changes will help to put more wealth and power in the hands of ordinary workers, which will in turn put some demand back into the lifeless economy we inherited. No surprise then to see Reform and Tory MPs lining up to vote against these changes.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSickle Cell: Protecting Patients’ Rights\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDespite being a chronic condition, Sickle Cell disease is still not legally recognised as a disability. This makes it harder for those living with the disease to secure flexible working, adjustments and medical leave. I’ve tabled this Early Day Motion, calling on the government to recognise Sickle Cell disease as a disability, improve awareness among employers and take action to protect Sickle Cell warriors’ workplace rights.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|",

Not even Tory members got a vote on this as just 357 Tory MPs appointed our latest Prime Minister.\nAs the same familiar faces return to the Cabinet, all the early indications suggest this is a moment of continuity rather than change with the inequality, corruption, and mismanagement that have characterised the last twelve years of Tory Government.\n|\n|\nSunak’s family is richer than the King, with a personal fortune of £730 million. In spite of this, his family avoided up to £20 million in tax by claiming non-dom status and Sunak himself had a green card even during his time as Chancellor. When he was running to be leader, Sunak bragged to Conservative Party members in Tunbridge Wells about rigging Treasury funding formulas to divert money to leafy Tory shires – away from areas where it was most needed.\nWe don’t need another unelected multimillionaire imposed on the country to inflict huge public service cuts and safeguard the interests of the super rich. We need a General Election now.\n|\n|\nImproving Support for Baby Loss\n|\n|\nIn Tuesday’s Baby Loss Awareness debate, I urged the Government to ensure safe staffing levels by paying midwives properly and address the racial inequalities we still see in maternal health outcomes. We must ensure that everyone gets the support they need to deal with the trauma of baby loss.\nFor every 30 midwives trained, NHS England loses 29. We have a shortage of 2,000+ midwives. Ensuring those experiencing baby loss get the highest levels of care and support means paying midwives properly and devising an action plan to end the staffing crisis. In a recent survey of midwifes considering quitting, 80% said lack of staff played a part and 67% said they were unhappy with the quality of care they were able to deliver. We desperately need to address this.\nBlack women are two times more likely to experience stillbirth, 50 per cent more likely to experience neonatal death and 43 per cent more likely to experience miscarriage. Still, the Government refuses to set binding targets to end these racial disparities. The Black Maternal Health All Party Parliamentary Group will be lobbying MPs to commit to this again next week at our Annual General Meeting, where we will also be discussing two major recent reports into Black Maternal Health.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBlack Blood Donors Needed\n|\n|\nI was pleased to host NHS Blood and Transplant’s Black History Month event in Parliament to raise awareness of the urgent need for more Black blood donors. It’s vital that we celebrate Black blood donors and the work being done by NHS Blood and Transplant and other changemakers in this area.\nWith 250 donations now needed every day for sickle cell patients and demand only likely to grow, we urgently need more people from Black ethnicities to come forwards and give blood. Just fifteen minutes of your time can save someone else’s life.\nEthnically matched blood provides the best treatment for sickle cell, keeping those most severely affected healthy and enabling them to lead fulfilling lives. With thousands of new Black blood donors required, I want to see the Government exploring further reforms around blood donation too.\nRemoving discriminatory blood donation laws for people from Black African communities last year was a big step forwards but these laws still cast a long shadow. There’s more work to do to build community confidence, make giving blood more inclusive and ensure everyone’s healthcare needs are met.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVoting Down the “Brexit Freedoms Bill”\n|\nThis week, MPs debated and had the chance to vote on the Government’s Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill, billed by the Brexiteers as the Brexit Freedoms Bill. It’s absurd that we’re in a situation where the Government is contemplating clogging up the civil service with a massive review of laws that overwhelmingly improve our living standards and protect workers and the environment from exploitation.\nI voted against this Bill, which would switch off 47 years of laws drawn up during EU membership in December 2023. It’s not about freedom; it’s about freedom for the Tories to rip up some of the baseline environmental and consumer protections that we currently enjoy.\n|\n|\nAccountability for Deaths in State Custody\n|\n|\nI joined the United Friends and Families Campaign (UFFC) yesterday to march for justice for the thousands of families who have lost loved ones in state custody. Every year since 1999, the UFFC has held an annual remembrance procession from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street to remember their loved ones and demand justice.\n1,838 people have died in police custody or following contact with the police since 1990 in England and Wales. Just one of these killings has resulted in a conviction, with families frequently denied answers about how their loved ones died – let alone answers. Just last month, we saw the fatal police shooting of Chris Kaba in our own constituency. His family’s fight has only strengthened my resolve to fight for answers and accountability from the police.\n|\n|\nOpening the New Playground at Hillside Gardens Park\n|\n|\nIt was a pleasure to join the Friends of Hillside Gardens Park for their “Hillside Gardens Halloween Fiesta” in Streatham Hill East on Sunday and open their new playground. Thanks in part to funding from Lambeth Council, the park has had a big upgrade, with new pathways paved, the tennis and sports courts refurbished, and a new playground installed. Having high-quality green spaces that are accessible to the whole community is really important for physical and mental wellbeing so it’s great to see these improvements.\n|\n|\nCelebrating Diwali at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple\n|\n|\nIt was a pleasure to join the Shree Swaminarayan Temple for their Diwali celebrations on Wednesday. Wishing a very prosperous and healthy Diwali to everyone who has been celebrating this week. May the light illuminate your lives and homes!\n|\n|\nWelcoming Dr Julius W Garvey to our Community\n|\n|\nI was honoured to welcome Dr Julius W Garvey, son of legendary political activist Marcus Garvey, to Streatham this week, where he was giving a talk to Lambeth Youth Council. We met at Lambeth Town Hall to talk about the work of the APPG on Reparations and the need for a global movement working together towards reparatory justice.\n|\n|\nCelebrating Black History Month with Looked After Children\n|\n|\nIt was great to join Lambeth foster children and carers to celebrate Black History Month on Friday. I talked about growing up in Lambeth, how I ended up representing Streatham as an MP, what my job entails and the importance of aspiration and advocacy. We have a duty to ensure that foster carers are properly supported and provide every child with a stable, loving home and the conditions to thrive.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_saving-british-steel/content_54.html": "I was in Parliament over the weekend supporting emergency legislation aimed at saving British Steel, after the government took the rare step of recalling MPs for a Saturday sitting. The Steel Industry (Special Measures) Bill will allow the government to take control of British Steel and intervene to keep Britain’s last blast furnaces going. It gives ministers the power to take control of steel assets, order materials to make steel and ensure steel workers are paid. Anyone breaching this law could face a jail sentence of up to two years.\nThe ability to produce low-carbon steel from scratch is vital to our net zero transition. The UK needs steel to build wind turbines and upgrade our railways. The least carbon-intensive way of doing this is to manufacture it here in electric arc furnaces powered by green electricity. This has the added benefit of maintaining high-quality green jobs.\nBritish Steel’s collapse highlights the issue with allowing essential sectors of the economy to remain in investors’ hands. When these sectors are profitable, company executives extract high returns for their shareholders. When they are not, company executives go to government with caps in hand safe in the knowledge that these companies are too important to fail.\nWe have seen the consequences of privatisation playing out similarly across our water and energy sectors in recent years. Again and again, the public has paid whilst shareholders rake it in. It would be irresponsible of the government to let the public take on the risk of a loss-making company without a plan to ensure that they also share in the rewards. It would be wrong for the government to put large amounts of public money into British Steel without giving the public a say in how they are run.\nI was pleased the government did not rule out the prospect of nationalisation but am concerned that it took financial collapse to prompt state action. Nationalising key industries like steel shouldn’t be done as a last resort; it is an essential prerequisite to securing their future. With steel under public control, not only would the government be able to protect precious manufacturing jobs in neglected regional economies, it would be able to position Britain as a genuine leader in green manufacturing. That’s the kind of ambition we need to see from the government here.",

I also argued that it is totally unsustainable to let energy companies make super profits while energy prices are low and expect taxpayers to bail them out. Ultimately, if we are going to build the resilient, renewable-based system that powers us out of the climate emergency, we have to take energy into public ownership.\nThe Government have been so busy desperately clinging on to power, they almost forgot about the energy bills crisis now hitting households. After this week’s Ofgem announcement that the energy price cap will rise by an astronomical £700, the Chancellor’s last-minute response doesn’t touch the sides of what is actually needed to help already struggling households.\nI was elected on a manifesto which would have insulated us from some of the worst impacts of the current crisis by ensuring billpayer money went into renewables, upgrading Britain’s draughty homes, improving the energy system and cutting costs for billpayers where possible, instead of lining shareholders’ pockets.\nInflation has just reached a 30-year high. Wages, welfare and pensions are all tumbling in real terms while national insurance is about to rise, along with the cost of basics like food, fuel, rent and energy. All the while, banks are doling out their biggest bonuses since they crashed the financial system in 2008. This squeeze on living standards is the consequence of a Conservative Government that prioritises the very rich at the expense of everyone else. By rejecting Labour’s proposals for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help bring down bills, they are choosing to put energy profits ahead of people who are struggling to make ends meet or heat their homes.\nInflation is heading for a 30-year high.

I’m hoping to hear back soon about their plans to address these issues and will update you if and when I do.\nFull text of letter:\nDear Mr Thompson,\nI am writing regarding the severe postal delays currently being experienced in my constituency of Streatham and the reported backlog of post at the Royal Mail sorting office on Prentis Road (SW16 1QA). Several constituents have contacted me regarding severe delays at the Royal Mail sorting office on Prentis Road which has resulted in constituents waiting for days, and in some severe cases, weeks for letters and parcels.\nI am aware that industrial action by members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), who are striking for an adequate pay award that covers the current cost-of-living increases, may have resulted in some delay to delivery times. However, the delays experienced in Streatham have been present long before the strikes began and as you will know, has been something that I have raised with Royal Mail on several occasions. Furthermore, Royal Mail has taken little action to meet the demands of the striking workers and settle the dispute.\nSevere postal delays in my constituency have been a present issue long before the CWU industrial action began, and I fear it will continue to be a problem even when the pay dispute is resolved. I am therefore asking, once again, that this issue be investigated and that steps are taken to address the delays and backlogs at the sorting office on Prentis Road.\nYours sincerely,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy MP",

My thoughts are with Chris’ loved ones as they continue their journey towards justice. This ruling is an important step towards accountability. The IOPC assured the Kaba family throughout the investigation that they were passing on all relevant and appropriate evidence to the CPS. After months of agony, it’s absolutely vital that the CPS now makes a swift decision. There’s no excuse for further delay.\n|\n|\nThe Casey Review paints a damning and familiar picture of the Met victimising communities, failing victims, creating a toxic working culture, and wrecking public confidence. Trust in policing is at an all-time low in our area. In the parliamentary statement on this report, I asked the Government to ensure officers are properly vetted and automatically suspended when they come under investigation for crime or misconduct. Before the Met can be trusted to police our communities, they need to show they can police themselves.\n|\n|\nMany people in our area are rightly asking why the Government has been creating new unaccountable police powers – which it openly admits will target racialised communities – instead of addressing abuses of existing police powers. But when the Government appears to be putting pressure on Met leadership not to use the term “institutional racism”, how can the public be confident they will address this?\n|\n|\nA Reverse Robin Hood Budget\n|\n|\nThis week, the Tories put down a Reverse Robin Hood budget which rewarded those responsible for inflation with a cumulative £29 billion in tax handouts, leaving ordinary people to suffer its consequences. I spoke and voted against this Budget in Parliament.\n|\nA tax handout to the top 1% is becoming a recurring theme in Tory Budgets. Meanwhile, most households are facing an effective £400 energy bill hike and another one in three months’ time. Benefits claimants face harsher sanctions as the Tories step up their scapegoating – but there was nothing to address stagnant wages, nothing on the cost of rent crisis, and nothing to repair crumbling public services which will see a £22 billion stealth hit in the coming years.\nAfter thirteen years, the evidence of exactly where austerity leads is all around us: longer food bank queues, more rough sleeping, falling pay packets, in-work poverty, spiralling living costs, terminally low productivity, and stalling life expectancy. The average household will see their disposable income shrinking by record amounts over the next two years. Austerity is a political choice; not an economic necessity – we need an alternative.\n|\n|\nOpposing Cruel and Costly Anti-Refugee Legislation\n|\n|\nThis week, I voted against the Tories’ Refugee Ban Bill. It’s act of violence against families seeking safety. We cannot allow the Conservatives to keep blaming their economic failures on some of the most vulnerable people in the world. Instead of slamming the door and subjecting people to further trauma, we need safe routes and international cooperation.\nWe should not be denying people safety, detaining them in increasingly inhospitable conditions, and deporting them to Rwanda because they took the one route available to them. This bill isn’t about protecting people, it’s about distracting from crumbling public services and the dire economic situation we are currently facing.\n|\n|\nBlack History is British History: Honouring Billy Waters\n|\n|\nI joined the Nubian Jak Community Trust last Tuesday to support the campaign to install a commemorative plaque honouring Billy Waters, Britain’s first celebrated African American popular performer, who died 200 years ago. Black history is British history and it’s so important that we tell it in full.\n|\n|\nBlack Maternal Health: Motherhood Group Conference\n|\n|\nI was pleased to deliver the keynote speech at the Motherhood Group conference last week, discussing how we can improve Black women’s experiences of maternity care and close the 3.7x mortality gap between black and white mothers. I set up the APPG on Black Maternal Health in September 2021, calling on the Government to set concrete targets for minimising inequalities in healthcare outcomes. Black women are not the problem. Our bodies are not broken.\n|\n|\nProtecting the Right to Vote\n|\n|\nLast Tuesday, I joined campaigners from Unlock Democracy, the Electoral Reform Society, Open Britain, and Fair Vote UK, who are highlighting the damaging impact of the Government’s Elections Bill. This legislation means that people will now have to display valid identification in order to cast a ballot.\nThe Tories’ real reason for bringing in mandatory Voter ID was to make it harder for the millions of lower income voters without passports or drivers’ licenses to have their say. Worryingly, it appears to be working just as intended, with up to 2.1 million not in possession of valid ID ineligible to vote in the upcoming local elections. Instead of locking people out of our democracy, we should be encouraging democratic participation.\n|\n|\nBurntwood and City Heights School Visits\n|\n|\nThe standout question from my school visits last week was “do MPs ever take it outside when they disagree?” It was lovely to visit Burntwood School to answer students’ questions about our political system and my role as an MP. It’s always great to talk to young people about careers and participation in our democratic process.\n|\n|\nIt was also good to be back with E-ACT City Heights Academy, where I saw the Becoming A Man programme in action, which helps young men navigate the challenges of growing up in our area. Every child should have access to school counselling and mental health support. This is something that Labour proposed in our last manifesto and I hope this idea is carried forwards into the next election.\n|\n|\nCampaigning for Renters’ Reform\n|\n|\nRenters shouldn’t be kicked out of their homes just for requesting repairs or refusing to put up with extortionate increases but in the past four years, 230,000+ people have been served with No Fault Eviction notices, despite the Tories’ pledge to ban them since then.\n|\n|\nI’m pleased to support Renters’ Reform Coalition campaigners, who are calling on the Government to stop them being forced out of their homes. Thank you to my constituents who came to Westminster earlier this month to ask the Government to reinstate the Renters’ Reform Bill and to scrap no fault evictions. It’s absolutely vital that we keep pushing to ensure there are comprehensive protections against eviction for private tenants and mechanisms to cap runaway rents.\n|\n|\nRemembering the Halabja Massacre\n|\n|\nThank you to our Deputy Mayor, Councillor Sarbaz Barznji, for holding the commemoration at Lambeth Town Hall of the Halabja Massacre. On March 16th 1988, over 5,000 Kurds were killed and 10,000 more injured in a chemical gas attack perpetrated by Saddam Hussein.\nMost were women and children, and this was followed by a genocide that killed hundreds of thousands. As the Kurdish people face ongoing persecution and violence, we remember past atrocities and stand in solidarity with their present struggle for freedom and peace.\n|\n|\nPartygate Inquiry\n|\n|\nLast week, Boris Johnson was questioned by the Parliamentary Standards Committee regarding his involvement in lockdown-era gatherings. We don’t need another inquiry or investigation to determine that he broke the rules that he imposed on the public, or that he lied to the public and to Parliament about this subsequently. Honesty in politics matters. He has to go.\n|\n|\nFighting Hunger in the UK\n|\n|\nThe rising prevalence of food bank use is a stain on our society. 1 in 5 households reported having skipped meals or gone hungry for an entire day, as the price of putting a meal on the table is now the second-largest pressure on low-income households after energy costs.\nI marched against hunger with Right to Food London activists who called on the Government to put the right to food in law and address the poverty and inequality that leaves too many struggling to feed themselves.\n|\n|\nI was also proud to join Mothers Manifesto as they held a hunger strike outside Downing Street on Mother’s Day to raise awareness to the fact that 1 in 4 mothers are now skipping meals to feed their kids. Mothers Manifesto demand that the Government ensure every child in the UK has enough to eat, keep their promises on aid and climate, and tax oil company profits. The number of children in food poverty has almost doubled in the last year. We need urgent action to end hunger.\n|\n|\nSafe Passage Protest\n|\n|\nAs the Tories voted through legislation slamming the door on refugees, I joined hundreds of protesters outside Parliament to fight for an alternative to their cruel and costly plans: safe routes and international cooperation. This is old fashioned divide and rule. We cannot let them blame their own failings on the most vulnerable.\n|\n|\nWindsor Framework Approval\n|\nI voted to change the Northern Ireland protocol. The new Windsor Framework will result in the more streamlined and efficient movement of goods through Northern Ireland, with a ‘green lane’ for goods going to Ireland, and a ‘red lane’ for the EU.\nEach of these will have their own process of relevant required checks. However, the Prime Minister, who backed Brexit from the start, deserves no credit for this one step for improvement after sliding backwards for the last few years.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_coronavirus-and-the-commonwealth/content_434.html": "The coronavirus will change the world as we know it. Every nation has had to re-evaluate themselves and their priorities and when it is over, every nation’s standing in the world will be re-evaluated for them. None more so than Britain. Discussions about Britain’s place in the world began as part of our never-ending Brexit saga, but if the way we handled that didn’t expose us, then our handling of coronavirus certainly will. While we continue to trade off the nostalgia of being world leaders, the pandemic is showing the world that we are leading nothing.\nWhile other countries offer residency to migrants, we maintain detention centres and no recourse to public funds. While other countries provide universal basic income, we leave the self-employed in limbo and offer small business owners relief in the form of debts. And while Cuba sends doctors around the world to fight Covid-19, staff in our chronically under-resourced NHS use bin liners in place of proper, personal protective equipment.\nDuring a recent Urgent Question about Jamaica deportation flights, a Conservative MP remarked that “British citizenship was a privilege, not a right”. Yet as I write, hundreds of thousands of British nationals are stranded abroad. British consulates have closed their doors and unplugged the phones. Brits look on as other countries pull out all the stops to get their citizens safely home. Some of the first countries to shut their borders to “Europeans” were former colonies. The world we know and our place in it is already changing.\nJust before our official departure from the EU, I made my maiden speech in a debate on Global Britain, which was clearly meant to be a celebration of our standing in the world. I said: “It strikes me that as a country we cannot begin to fulfil the idea of global Britain until we first address the historic injustices of the British empire, injustices including slavery and colonialism; first, because it is the right thing to do, but also because we may soon find ourselves out in the cold if we do not.”\nThe one thing that I agree with ardent Brexiteers on is that Commonwealth countries could be our most fruitful trading partners after Brexit. But while my comments were overwhelmingly welcomed by people across the Commonwealth, they were met with ridicule and racist abuse here at home. And herein lies our problem.\nAdvocates of “Global Britain” clearly hearken back to the last time when Britain really did have global power. But there’s underlying bathos to the phrase in a time when power bases are shifting. This was exemplified by Theresa May’s unsuccessful trade visit to India in 2016, where talks floundered over migration and Brexit. More recently, a Foreign Affairs Select Committee report on the UK’s relationship with India stressed that the UK’s failure to become more open to overseas workers, students and tourists, would limit our capacity to build new trading relationships.\nThe recent publication of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review highlighted the institutional racism that underpins our approach to immigration. This racism and the way we view the Global South has roots in slavery, colonialism and empire. So, it stands to reason that until we address these historic ills, we will continue to alienate the countries whose friendship will be paramount after Brexit.\nInstead of doing this, the government introduced its glossy continuation of the hostile environment: a “points-based” system cloaked in rhetoric, but not enough to conceal its concession to anti-migrant sentiments. Even at a potential economic cost. While we pander to populist ideas about immigration, we have fallen from being India’s second-largest trade partner in 1998-99, to its 17th in 2018-19. In a world outside the EU, are we really so arrogant to think that we can call all of the shots with India, a country which recently surpassed the UK to become the fifth-largest economy in the world?\nWe saw this same disregard at the recent UK-Africa trade summit, dubbed the “scramble for Africa”. The prime minister’s speech showed he had not been listening to African leaders at all, making no reference to Africa’s past and perhaps more surprisingly, no reference to its future – the African common market. When established, this will be the largest free trade area in the world, and there is already talk of accelerating the process to cushion African economies against a post-pandemic global recession.\nThe prime minister’s omission was glaring given that the summit’s whole purpose was to discuss trade with the UK after leaving the EU’s common market. Countries like Ghana, Kenya and Uganda, which Britain deliberately underdeveloped, stole resources from, and brutally enslaved, are already among the fastest-growing economies in the world. Imagine what an African market would mean, and then imagine the level of arrogance it takes to ignore it. Coronavirus is exposing a truth that should give advocates of Global Britain pause for thought: “they” do not need “us”.\nAs our government panders to nationalism, it would do well to remember that nationalism is not a uniquely western concept. Many Commonwealth countries will only remember a past of exploitation and a present in which they are subjected to punitive IMF conditions, crippling their social infrastructure in serving the interests of more powerful countries like the UK. Countries in the global south have their own nationalists and every one of them will tell you that their achievements are in spite of Britain’s atrocities, not because of aid or the “privilege” of being colonised.\nWhy does this all matter now? Coronavirus demonstrates more than ever the importance of global cooperation. It has also shown that we have less and less to offer. We will come through this crisis and when we do, we need to find a new economic foothold. But we cannot successfully do this if we’re unwilling to approach our former colonies from a place of equality, respect and understanding. We weren’t prepared for the reality of coronavirus but we must prepare to face our place in the world when the pandemic is over.\nArticle reproduced from The Independent’s ‘Alien Nation’ series: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/coronavirus-uk-brexit-commonwealth-empire-india-africa-trade-a9446711.html",

The Government should bring in mandatory pay gap reporting for ethnicity and other protected characteristics. The 23rd of February is the day that women start earning money relative to men. With the gender pay gap now standing at 14.9%, women effectively worked from January 1st until the 23rd February for free. On current progress, it will be over 20 years before the UK closes our gender pay gap. The Government must do more to ensure equal pay for equal work.

On the flip-side, immigration bail and electronic reporting are both completely feasible ways of tracking individuals. Of course, perhaps the Government is afraid that the success of these methods would only prove what an immense waste of money and human misery immigration detention really is.\n“The Home Office has suggested that nobody in immigration detention centres has caught the disease yet but how can they know that given the wider absence of community testing and the asymptomatic nature of the disease. We need urgent clarity on this.\n“We know many people have been detained through no fault of their own in recent times – during the Windrush scandal for instance. Many people who are detained are held for a short time and released once they can prove their citizenship. It’s completely unfair to put them at heightened risk in this way.\n“As the Government draws up its emergency plans for prisons, they must do the right thing and put human life before their commitment to arbitrary net migration targets.”\nNotes:\n- ‘Coronavirus: call to release UK immigration centre detainees’, The Guardian (14 March 2020), https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-call-to-release-uk-immigration-centre-detainees\n- ‘PRESS RELEASE: TWO TESTED FOR CORONAVIRUS IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION: GOVERNMENT MUST PREPARE TO RELEASE ALL THOSE DETAINED ON PUBLIC HEALTH GROUNDS’, press release from Detention Action, https://detentionaction.org.uk/2020/03/09/press-release-two-tested-for-coronavirus-in-immigration-detention-government-must-prepare-to-release-all-those-detained-on-public-health-grounds/\nFor further information about this press release, please contact Ollie Collard, Communications Officer, Office of the Shadow Immigration Officer, Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP at oliver.collard@parliament.uk or on 07918110617.",

The Department for Education revealed that the number of looked-after children has hit its highest number yet – up 1 per cent from 2020 to 80,850 – and the County Councils Network has predicted that this number will hit 100,000 by 2025. We must urgently address the national epidemic of inequality which has been growing silently in the dark.\nDespite children in care making up less than 1 per cent of the population, the latest statistics from an independent government review released this year showed that care leavers make up a quarter of prison and homeless populations in this country. This is staggering and is a stark reminder of our nation’s failure to our society’s most vulnerable. But where are we failing them?\nI believe that this issue is rooted in two areas: a lack of protection and a dangerously out-of-date attitude perpetuated from the top down.\nTo address the first issue, children in care are highly vulnerable to exploitation by criminal gangs. Gangs know that these children, who have already suffered trauma and been uprooted from stability, will be searching for a sense of belonging and, quite simply, frightened. These gangs do their research. They wait around care homes, schools and shopping centres to make their move. Starting with small, easy tasks for big rewards, children in care are slowly drawn into their web until they feel unable to leave. Before they are even out of the care system, they’ve already been groomed into a life of crime.\nThe second issue which perpetuates the first is difficult to quantify, but is nevertheless to blame, and that is the government’s attitude towards children in care. As outlined in a recent report by children’s rights campaigners at Serenity Welfare, looked-after children and young people are viewed and treated as problems to be dealt with, rather than human beings with just as much potential as anyone else. Cuts to services intended to stop children in care from spiralling into dangerous life choices are a clear indicator that the government does not see them as worth saving. They are written off, with no encouragement or the necessary support systems in place to allow them to achieve, and left to fall into a life of crime.\nOne example of this is in the shocking scandal of innocent children in care as young as nine being handcuffed whilst being transported between care settings. These are children that have not been accused of a crime and yet are deemed potentially problematic, for example because of a history of self-harm. Is it any wonder children in care enter a life of crime when they are treated like criminals from the start?\nThe care-system-to-prison pipeline shows our abject failure towards looked-after children. We must ensure that we are not only preventing harms and abuses while children are in care, but that they are given a support system for them to thrive. I firmly believe that mentoring for young people in care should be far more widespread and accepted as a legitimate form of support. With a dedicated, trained point of contact whose sole aim is to grow our children’s emotional and holistic wellbeing, we could divert more care leavers from prison and the streets towards higher education and employment.\nThe current children’s social care review must focus on not only improving young people’s time spent in the system, but also on levelling out the playing field of their future outside it. We are living in a Britain where these disproportionalities are only going to grow wider until we take action and take looked-after children’s futures seriously.\nThis article was first published on The Independent on the 25th November 2021.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_its-time-to-admit-labour-was-right-about-free-broadband-and-tackle-the-digital-divide/content_326.html": "Universal free broadband was pilloried by the press and the Conservatives alike during the last election, but as the pandemic forces us to recognise what is really useful, there will be a generation demanding that internet is recognised as a basic right.\nAs we head into another full national lockdown, families across the country are coping with the challenge of school closures at extremely short notice. It is worth reiterating that schools are one of the last things anyone wants to shut down, especially teachers, who understand the serious impact this will have on their most disadvantaged students better than anyone. But with the government unwilling to act to bring the infection rate down, I commend education staff for taking a decisive stance to protect the whole community.\nFor children without access to devices and internet, school closures will mean a virtual halt to their education. At the start of the pandemic, Ofcom estimated that up to 1.78 million children in the UK did not have access to a laptop, tablet or desktop device, with 880,000 living in households with only a mobile internet connection.\nThe idea of universal free broadband was pilloried by the press and the Conservatives alike during the last election. But as the pandemic forces us to rethink what is really valuable and useful to us as a society, there will be a generation demanding that internet is recognised as a basic right.\nWithout a home internet connection, people face exclusion across every area of life. Nowhere are the effects of this clearer than in education, where the stakes could not be higher. During the first lockdown, we saw an unprecedented rise in educational inequality, with the learning gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers rising 46% between July 2019 and July 2020.\nWe have known for months that schools were going to face disruption. We have also known that distance learning was going to be a key part of the education mix to contain transmission of the virus. The Department of Education’s insistence that schools stay open at all costs stands in stark contrast with its refusal to give schools the resources they need to cope with disruption.\nThe Department of Education has now pledged to deliver 750,000 devices by the end of next week. This begs two questions: firstly, if it can be done that quickly, why has it been on the back burner for nine months? Secondary school attendance was down 15% on last year in the last week of term before Christmas. Children in my constituency have been off without access to devices this whole time. Secondly, given the DfE’s woeful performance so far, will this be another case of overpromising and underdelivering?\nThe Welsh Labour government worked with schools and local authorities to quickly provide laptops and routers to disadvantaged learners by the end of May. In Westminster, they outsourced the task provision without competitive tender to Computacentre, another company with family links to Tory donors. As their June deadline came and went, schools were left without many of the 230,000 laptops initially promised, who later ended up slashing allocation by up to 80% for schools in some of the most disadvantaged areas of the country.\nThroughout the pandemic, I’ve worked with local schools to deliver laptops, tablets and other devices to school pupils who would otherwise struggle to access them at home. The generosity of our community means we’ve been able to distribute close to 100 donated devices to local schools so far, but this is a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed after a decade of rising poverty and deep education cuts.\nRight now we face a pivotal moment for children’s education and must pull together. But the pandemic has been a lesson that the government must not leave communities to fend for themselves. As we rebuild, we must guarantee a device for every child and full-fibre internet for every home.\nFind out more about my Laptops for Learning initiative here.\nThis article was first published on 7th January on Politics Home: https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/its-time-to-admit-labour-was-right-about-free-broadband-and-tackle-the-digital-divide",

Budget 2021 was a missed opportunity to launch a green, equitable recovery to put people on a secure footing and address a decade of debilitating inequality.\nRather than addressing the structural weaknesses that allowed Covid-19 to run rampant through the UK, from overcrowded housing to chronically low sick pay, the Government chose to return to doing some of the same things that left us in such a weak position to start with. In my speech, I pointed out that the Government’s failure to recognise that the best economic solution was a public health solution has exacerbated the difficulties we are now facing.\nFrom a £25 billion tax giveaway to businesses like Amazon to another real-terms pay cuts for NHS workers and other public sector staff, it’s clear we are dealing with a Government whose first priority is helping the rich get richer.

The most obvious examples of this are EasyJet and British Airways. But workers are fighting back with trade unions seeing a surge in membership. Today I joined aviation workers on Westminster Green to highlight corporate attempts to slash jobs, pay and working conditions, which have been aided and abetted by this incompetent Government.\nDuring the pandemic, companies receiving emergency government loans have continued to pay their wealthy shareholders, even as they lay off workers and push them onto worse contracts.

I criticised this at the time, writing to the Government and in the Independent. Companies should ask their shareholders for bailouts before turning to the taxpayer.\nThere’s also been no attempt to place binding environmental conditions on this money, which – coupled with a lack of green investment – seriously throws into doubt reaching our 2050 net-zero emissions target.\nWith the aviation sector on its knees, the government must course-correct and take action to protect jobs in the industry in the short-term and secure a long-term just transition.

Our government must heed today’s call for provisional measures to stop the slaughter and do everything in our power to ensure the UK is not complicit. That can begin with diplomatic efforts for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire that prioritises civilian life and centres on the safe return of all hostages. There is also no justification for UK arms exports to continue to Israel whilst the ICJ case is ongoing.",

Twelve years of real terms pay cuts for workers across our health service have been a contributing factor to the recruitment and retention crisis it now faces. This dispute is about pay and the fact that some of the most essential workers in our society are now on poverty wages. But its roots lie much deeper, in the Tories’ consistent under-resourcing and under-valuation of our NHS and the people who keep it running.\n|\n|\nI was pleased to support Labour’s motion on the NHS workforce crisis, calling for an end to non-dom status as a means of pumping more money into training new NHS staff. If the Government were serious about tackling treatment waiting lists and ambulance delays, they would be funding the fair pay rise that NHS workers are asking for. Instead, as the Royal College of Nursing head for their first week of strike action in 106 years, the Government refuses to even meet with them.\n|\n|\nPostal workers launched their first December day of strike action on Friday to call for fair pay rises and defend the postal service we all rely on. Instead of entering into negotiations in good faith, they’ve put new threats of job cuts and gig economy conditions on the table. After a year of record profits, if Royal Mail can’t operate without driving down pay and cutting jobs, then that’s just another good argument to take the service back into public ownership where it belongs, and as a majority of the country wants.\nSolidarity with Shelter workers in Unite, who have also launched strike action this week over real terms pay cuts of 11%. It’s a bitter irony that some workers at the homelessness charity facing housing insecurity as a consequence of falling pay, with one member writing to me to explain how they were having to move out of London.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nHolding the Tories to Account over Dodgy PPE Deals\n|\nThis week, I voted for Labour’s successful motion to force the release of documentation around a highly suspect PPE deal, which earned a Tory Peer an estimated £29 million. This contract was signed off by then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and was worth £203 million in total. More than half of this money was spent on PPE that did not meet the required standards.\nWhilst NHS staff were left struggling without adequate PPE, the Tories were busy helping those with party ties profiteer off vital medical equipment. They treated a public health emergency as a business bonanza for their nearest and dearest. We need an investigation to determine how much public money has ended up lining the pockets of Tory politicians, donors, and other people with close links to the party. We should be looking to hold politicians who brokered these deals accountable and recover money that was given to companies for PPE which did not meet the required specification.\n|\n|\nVisiting Derwentside Detention Centre\n|\n|\nAs an outgoing member of the Women and Equalities Committee, I visited the recently opened Derwentside Immigration Removal Centre. This facility should never have been opened. We came away from the site with familiar questions about costs and conditions but it’s worth remembering that 85% of those held in such facilities are returned to the community – a statistic which raises questions about both the morality and efficacy of ever detaining people like this in the first place. The Government should be closing down detention sites, as Labour pledged to in our last manifesto, not ramping up the pointless use of cruel detention. But as the Tories crack down on migrants, the number of people entering the detention estate almost doubled in the year to March 2022.\n|\n|\nSmall Business Saturday\n|\n|\nOn Small Business Saturday, we celebrated the amazing small businesses that make up our local community. It was great to be out on Abbeville Road on Saturday afternoon with Clapham Councillors to check-in with local business owners. Labour has a plan to level the playing field for SMEs by cutting business rates for small firms, ensuring large companies pay invoices on time and giving SMEs a fair chance to win public contracts – instead of big Tory donor companies.\nThere are a range of issues that are causing problems for small businesses at the moment: from rising energy, inflation and reduced customer spending. But a survey last week found the single biggest issue causing disruption continues to be Brexit. This is no surprise given that small businesses have thinner margins to absorb supply chain shocks and fewer resources to cope with the additional barriers to trade that Brexit has imposed. Small businesses don’t want the bonfire of EU regulations that the Government is proposing; they want the freedom to trade with EU countries without the blue tape.\n|\n|\nStreatham BID Christmas Light Switch-On\n|\n|\nLast weekend, we declared Streatham officially open for Christmas. It was great to be with Streatham BID for a lovely event to ring in the festive season and hit the big red button on their amazing Christmas light display. Our small independent business community brings so much colour and character to our High Street. Please support them where you can this Christmas by shopping local.\nIn my time as an MP, I’ve been really impressed with Streatham BID’s work to upgrade our High Street and get more people shopping there. Every business with at rateable value of over £7,000 will have the opportunity to vote for its renewal in January 2023. I’d urge them to keep supporting Streatham BID and all its investment in our area through this difficult time.\n|\n|\nNotre Dame Estate Walkabout\n|\n|\nI joined Notre Dame Estate residents and their councillors on a walkabout last weekend to hear about some of the issues they’re currently facing. We discussed ways to mitigate speeding on Worsopp Drive as well as their thoughts around the next proposed phase of the neighbouring Lambeth College redevelopment. I was concerned to hear about the noise from the site that residents have been experiencing, particularly where work has reportedly been happening outside of contracted hours. I will be raising theses issues with the relevant authorities.\n|\n|\nSupporting Local Food Banks\n|\n|\nThere are more food banks in Britain today that there are McDonald’s. I joined local food bank volunteers at Tesco Acre Lane this weekend for a big donation drive to restock their warehouses over winter. In a wealthy country like ours, people shouldn’t be left relying on charity to feed themselves. It’s so important to support our food banks but also to remember that this can never be a substitute from working to end poverty and inequality, which are the root causes of hunger.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStreatham Drop-In Christmas Party\n|\n|\nIt was lovely to be with The Streatham Drop-In Centre over the weekend for their Christmas Party, a good chance to thank the team for all they do for our local refugee community and extend a warm welcome to recently arrived families. I’m proud to live in one of two Boroughs of Sanctuary in London, where we are committed to giving refugees a warm welcome and helping them to rebuild their lives. Whilst the Government relentlessly fails and demonises people who seek safety in our country, groups like Streatham Drop-In are working tirelessly to give them a better start.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_the-hostile-environment-is-being-kept-in-place-even-amid-the-coronavirus-crisis/content_452.html": "It was recently reported that an elderly woman with lung cancer was told she would have to fly home to Ukraine in order to receive treatment. This would be quite a feat given there are currently no flights going into the country. Confronted with this news, Home Office administrators suggested that she drive instead. This absurd case highlights the intractable and insensitive culture behind day-to-day Home Office bureaucracy, which recently came in for serious criticism with the long-awaited publication of the Windrush Lessons Learned review.\nIn another sign that the Home Office is intending to carry out business as usual, it hasn’t updated its coronavirus immigration advice for the best part of a month. Its determination to maintain the hostile environment, even in these unprecedented times, will surprise nobody who has been closely tracking developments in immigration policy over the past few months.\nThe pandemic has thrown the UK’s hostile environment into the spotlight once again. As the Home Office continues to fly in the face of common sense and humanity, migrants are being left to fend off the impending Covid-19 crisis on their own. As food banks are driven into closure by dwindling volunteer numbers and supermarket shortages, it is undocumented migrants who will be worst affected. There are too many migrants currently on the brink of destitution without recourse to public funds.\nThe situation in healthcare is equally dire. While the government has confirmed that migrants can get tested for Covid-19 on the NHS at no charge, it has failed to publicise this fact. Equally, if they test negative for coronavirus and require other treatment, they could still incur charges.\nAny policy that deters people from seeking medical treatment under the current circumstances is not only inhumane – it can also exacerbate the spread of the virus. Pausing the immigration healthcare surcharge to ensure everyone comes forward would make a world of sense – not least because the security apparatus surrounding it is so expensive.\nPrisons were quickly identified as one area where coronavirus could spread like wildfire without special provisions. It took a while longer for the government to accept the danger posed to people in immigration detention centres, and even longer to publicly acknowledge it. The Home Office has maintained the pretence that it will carry on with deportations as usual but the fact that it cannot do so means it shouldn’t be keeping them prisoner in the first place.\nThe government has now removed some of the most at-risk people from detention centres, but keeping people in such a risky situation seems entirely disproportionate when you remember that their main crime was not being born in this country. We also know that most people who are detained are let out after less than a month, which – as one prison inspector noted in 2015 – “raises questions about the validity of their detention in the first place”.\nThere are even some voices from the Conservative benches that are now recognising problems in our current immigration system as a result of coronavirus. Tory backbencher Steve Double pointed out how workers who were maligned as low-skilled just last month are “actually pretty crucial to the smooth running of our country”, and called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to think again.\nAs I pointed out recently in my critique of the points-based immigration system, all work is skilled work when it’s done well. Coronavirus is reminding everyone that there is no such thing as low-skilled work – only low-paid work. As the rich flee the worst-hit areas in London, it’s the migrant workforce that is keeping the city on its feet.\nWhy is the Home Office so determined to carry on with business as usual when it’s clearly dangerous and impractical? It seems obvious to me that the real reason they are so scared about giving ground is that it will show up the monumental pointlessness, waste and tragedy of the current system.\nThe crisis so far has taught us two important things: that infections do not recognise national borders, and that public health is precisely that – public. It’s in the interests of all of us to ensure that everyone else has the means to stay healthy during the crisis.\nLeaving people without the means to meet their basic needs isn’t just a human tragedy during a global pandemic – it’s also a serious public health issue. As activists rally together and sense some cracks in the current immigration infrastructure, it is more important than ever that Labour stands up to oppose the hostile environment.\nThis article was first published on LabourList: https://labourlist.org/2020/03/the-hostile-environment-and-the-coronavirus-health-crisis/",

But this month, the Government put down a Reverse Robin Hood budget which showed us who’s really incapable of budgeting.\nThey chose to reward those responsible for inflation with a cumulative £29 billion in tax handouts whilst leaving ordinary people to suffer its consequences. The average household will see their disposable income shrinking by record amounts over the next two years.\nA tax handout to the top 1% is becoming a recurring theme of Tory Budgets, with the Government electing to remove the lifetime allowance on pension savings. They claim this is an attempt to retain doctors but the maths doesn’t add up. Even the right-leaning Institute for Fiscal Studies describes this approach as using a “golden sledgehammer to crack a nut”.\nMeanwhile, most households are facing an effective £400 energy bill hike and another one in three months’ time. Benefits claimants face harsher sanctions as the Tories step up their scapegoating but there was nothing to address stagnant wages, nothing on the cost of rent crisis, and nothing to repair crumbling public services, which will instead see a £22 billion stealth hit in the coming years.\nAfter thirteen years, the evidence of exactly where austerity leads is all around us: longer food bank queues, more rough sleeping, falling pay packets, in-work poverty, spiralling living costs, terminally low productivity, stalling life expectancy.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_throw-out-the-overseas-operations-bill/content_139.html": "The UK government is getting ready to defy international law for the second time in two weeks. Before parliament this afternoon for its second reading, the overseas operations (service personnel and veterans) bill is their latest attempt to use domestic law as a means of reneging on the UK’s international obligations.\nIn current form, this bill effectively decriminalises torture, violates essential rule of law principles such as judicial and prosecutorial independence, and defies international human rights law. Just a week after Boris Johnson ripped up his own “oven-ready” Brexit deal (the withdrawal agreement), it would mean soldiers cannot be prosecuted for war crimes if five years have passed since the alleged date of the incident. Given the time scale involved with reporting most war crimes, this would provide British soldiers with de facto immunity for acts of torture and other breaches of the Geneva Convention.\nThis has obvious and disastrous implications for upholding justice for the victims of war crimes. The overwhelming evidence suggests that some British soldiers did commit acts of torture and other breaches of the Geneva Convention during the US-UK led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thousands of complaints of mistreatment have been lodged by Iraqi and Afghan civilians. Only last month, evidence came to light that the Ministry of Defence had withheld evidence relating to the possible execution of 33 Afghan civilians in 2011.\nIn spite of this, there have been few prosecutions and even fewer convictions, with the director of the Service Prosecution Authority (SPA) ruling out further legal action against accused soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan in all but one case. There have been just seven prosecutions arising from the Iraq war. All of this is not to deny that vexatious claims against military personnel are a possibility, but rather that it’s pure confection to suggest the problem requires this kind of extreme solution.\nClearly, this bill is not really about protecting veterans, which is why it has no support from senior legal military figures. Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett – Britain’s most senior military judge, who was not even consulted before this legislation was published – has called on the Defence Secretary to “think again” about these “ill-conceived” proposals.\nThe government claims that this is about patriotism and standing up for our military personnel, but its bill would actually restrict the time in which soldiers can make claims against the Ministry of Defence. How exactly does this support troops who face conditions such as PTSD years later? If this government really cared about UK veterans, it would do something to address the plight of the thousands of veterans left to sleep rough on the streets or failed by inadequate mental health services.\nThe real thrust of this bill is twofold. Firstly, to shield the MoD and government from being held to account for their foreign adventures. Secondly, perhaps the key strand of the Dominic Cummings-Boris Johnson project, to concentrate power in the hands of the executive. Enabling the Attorney General to decide whether accusations merit prosecution is putting what should be an independent prosecutorial decision in the hands of a political appointee. In other words, allowing the government to mark their own homework.\nPassing this bill would send yet another clear message that the UK government is above the law. It is therefore disappointing to see that many of those who were willing to take a stand against violating international law under on the subjects of trade and Brexit are less concerned about violating international law on human rights.\nWe don’t set time limits on serious domestic offences, so why would we set these on offences committed overseas? We cannot say that Black Lives Matter, then turn a blind eye to the decriminalisation of torture of Black and Brown people in other countries. All human rights matter. All human rights must be protected.\nThere’s nothing remotely patriotic about rejecting international law and decriminalising torture. It just leaves British soldiers and civilians around the world less safe. That’s why, along with colleagues in the Socialist Campaign Group, I’ve tabled a reasoned amendment to throw out the overseas operations bill this evening.\nWe must unequivocally condemn any legislation that decriminalises torture, defies international law and does nothing to protect troops from false claims, all to limit transparency around military interventions and further enhance the executive power of this self-serving, self-interested government of the few.\nThis article first appeared on Labour List: https://labourlist.org/2020/09/throw-out-the-overseas-operations-bill-decriminalising-torture-isnt-patriotic/",

Public leisure facilities play a vital role in supporting local communities but long closures during lockdown have taken their toll. When the Government instructed them to close their doors in late March, most lost their income overnight.\nSince then, most have consistently fallen through the gaps in the government’s support packages. Estimates show 67% of public leisure providers are currently facing the risk of permanent closure in the next nine to twelve months. We can’t afford to let this happen.\nSince 70% of public leisure facilities are owned by local authorities, the cost of this collapse would only fall back on the exchequer anyway, while depriving people of access. Going forwards, we need to make sure exercise is affordable and accessible for all. A top priority must be ring-fenced central government funding to help local authority leisure providers to preserve these vital services.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_why-are-chris-kabas-loved-ones-having-to-fight-so-hard-for-answers/content_156.html": "Last Monday, Chris Kaba was run off the road during a police pursuit on Kirkstall Gardens, a quiet residential street in the heart of my Streatham constituency, before he was shot and killed. Photographs taken the morning after at the scene show a single bullet hole bored through the driver’s side of the car windscreen.\nOne week on, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has now confirmed that Chris was unarmed and that the car that triggered his pursuit was not registered to him. But Chris’s loved ones are still in the dark over the exact circumstances that led up to his death.\nChris’s killing has reverberated through the community. As a Lambeth MP, my constituency is located in a borough with some of the lowest expressed levels of confidence in policing anywhere in London. Just 38 per cent of people trust the police to treat everyone fairly no matter who they are, according to the latest public attitudes survey on policing from the London Mayor’s office.\nChris is not the first young Black man to die after contact with the police. According to the charity Inquest, 1,883 people have died in custody or following contact with the police since 1990, with just one prosecution of an officer in that time period. Families have been left waiting decades for answers, let alone justice. Chris’s family know they will face a protracted fight for answers, and perhaps a longer one still for genuine accountability.\nChris’s killing comes after a catalogue of recent local incidents: from disclosures about police strip searches of Black children in our borough, to the death of Ian Taylor in police custody just up the road in Brixton as he struggled to breathe. People are angry that this is still happening. These events reflect deeper issues with institutional racism in policing. Without acknowledgement and commitments to act on this, apologies from Met leadership are just reputation management.\nThis case also shows how accountability is still something that has to be fought for; not something that is hardwired into policing. If someone ended up dead in most other lines of work, that would be cause for immediate suspension. It took several interventions from the family, campaigners and MPs for the Met to suspend the officer who fired the shot.\nIt also took several days for the IOPC to escalate this case to a homicide investigation. Only time will tell if this delay proves costly. It shouldn’t require vast amounts of public pressure to trigger what should be basic features of police accountability.\nWe do need a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Chris’s killing. However, there is no reason that police or the IOPC could not have communicated with Chris’s family in the same way they have during other similar incidents.\nTheir wishes now are simple. They want a timeline for the IOPC investigation so that they know when they can expect answers. They want access to the body cam footage so they can see for themselves what happened that night and start to get closure. And above all, they want accountability for Chris’s death.\nWhen people die during police contact, we always hear how important it is to get the full facts before jumping to conclusions. But this presumption of innocence is one that is seldom extended to those who end up dead.\nWhere there’s a lack of information, stereotypes fill the vacuum. Prejudice mushrooms and multiplies in the dark. There seems to be a reflexive belief that the person in question must have done something wrong to deserve such treatment – a trope which has roots in colonial stereotypes of Black people as unruly subjects: violent and criminal.\nRather than dwelling on the fact that Chris was a father-to-be and an architecture student, who was loved by his family and his community, and was unarmed, the knee-jerk response in certain sections of the media was to foreground his association with drill music and focus on the mistakes he had made in the past.\nThe new Met commissioner Mark Rowley took up his role this week, promising to act with ”fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality” and pledging to renew “policing by consent”. If this is more than just rhetoric, he will start by honouring Chris’s family in their call for answers and accountability.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_set-the-vaccine-patents-free/content_194.html": "Trickle-down vaccination won’t get us out of the pandemic. We must suspend the COVID-19 vaccine patents.\nLast week, the UN published a report which concluded that “the situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented… It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response.” At the root of these issues has been a systemic inability to recognise that nobody is safe until everyone is and the best economic response to the pandemic was always a public health response to safeguard human life.\nNothing better sums this up than the international failure to get the world vaccinated. What we needed was an internationally coordinated response to prioritise the vulnerable and prevent healthcare systems being overwhelmed. What we got was wealthy nations using their purchasing power to secure enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over, at the expense of poorer nations.\nJust 0.3% of the supply has gone to the low-income countries who have the greatest need to vaccinate their vulnerable. Vaccines are not expected to be available in some countries until late 2023. Meanwhile, the UK alone has already secured 457 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, almost 5% of the projected global supply for 2021 and enough to fully vaccinate our entire population three times over. The Government’s contribution to the WHO’s Covax programme is a widow’s mite when our own rollout is predicated on such blatant vaccine hoarding.\nIn the current context of trickle-down vaccination, rich countries like the UK are not just sitting on huge quantities of current supply, they’re also standing in the way of creating more. By suspending the patents for Covid-19 vaccines, we could enable some of the world’s idle factories to start manufacturing them, increase supply, and get them to the people who need them most. Boris Johnson’s consistent refusal to support the international call for a TRIPS (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) waiver on Covid-19 vaccines is yet another example of the market’s needs being put before before people’s.\nWhilst shareholders rake in enormous vaccine profits and hold patents hostage, it’s worth pointing out that Covid-19 vaccines were made possible almost entirely by public money and international scientific cooperation; especially the 97% publicly funded Astra Zeneca vaccine – contrary to Boris Johnson’s bluster. Even more than the billions of pounds of government funding poured into Covid-19 research during the pandemic, it was decades of government-funded research that laid the groundwork for these vaccines. They were funded by all, so they should be free to all.\nIn spite of this, not a single vaccine patent holder has volunteered to share their technology through the WHO’s Covid Technology Access Pool (C-TAP). There is also increasing evidence that pharmaceutical companies are charging low-income countries over the odds and profiteering.\nThe fact that we are left begging pharmaceutical companies to share life-saving technology that we paid for is an indictment of the whole system. Not least because it’s actually in the interest of wealthy countries like the UK as much as low-income countries to break the shareholders’ stranglehold on the patents and set the vaccines free.\nBy helping low-income countries to inoculate their vulnerable populations and frontline workers, we can reduce the chance of their healthcare systems becoming overwhelmed. This won’t just save lives but will also reduce the likelihood of new more virulent strains of the virus emerging, saving lives and removing potential bumps in our roadmap to recovery.\nProtecting pharmaceutical monopolies just means protecting the virus’s monopoly over public life. With the Biden administration in the US signalling it will drop its opposition to a life-saving IP waiver, there is now a chance for us to crank up the pressure on our own government.\nJust as a candle can light infinite others without diminishing its light, sharing the vaccine patents is a way of spreading life-saving knowledge. We cannot allow pharmaceutical companies or their allies in government to extinguish this hope in pursuit of their own self-interest.\nTrickle-down vaccination won’t get us out of the pandemic. In these times of national retrenchment, it’s up to us to light the way and uphold the crucial principles of international solidarity and cooperation. Let’s keep up the pressure to set the vaccines free.\nThis article was first published on the 20th May on Labour Outlook.",

Chris was killed by armed police in my constituency of Streatham, after being followed by unmarked vehicles.\nI have met his family and feel the pain and trauma within our community and completely support the protests that happened across the country after Chris’ death.\nI have been on marches and protests led by bereaved families whose loved ones have died following contact with the police.\nAnd I know how important they are in building public support, raising awareness, demanding justice, and forcing meaningful change.\nThis is why I’m so worried by the Government’s Public Order Bill, which threatens to silence minoritised groups and make it more dangerous for people to protest and stand up for what they believe in.\nThis Bill is a continuation of the Government’s assault on our right to protest, and will criminalise people who call for the changes we so desperately need.\nOne of the Bill’s most concerning aspects is the creation of new protest-specific stop and search powers, including the power for the police to stop and search people without suspicion.\nThe introduction of these powers will make it unsafe for people in already overpoliced communities to exercise their right to protest, for fear of further intimidation and arrest.\nWe already know that the current powers are disproportionately used against people of colour, so I wasn’t surprised to see the latest stats showing that Black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people .\nThe experience of being stopped and searched is mentally and physically traumatising, and for some people, it is already a frequent, even daily, reality.\nInstead of rolling back these policies, the Government’s expansion of them within the protest space is a direct attack on the right to protest and will further entrench racism in our criminal justice system.\nIt will worsen the racism that already exists in policing and make protests unsafe for people from marginalised communities. Again, it is those already locked out of the corridors of power, for whom protest is a vital tool, who will be worst impacted.\nIn Lambeth, the borough my constituency is in, just 39% of people trust the police to treat everyone fairly no matter who they are , the lowest level of any borough in London.\nI remember very clearly the undisguised violence towards women at the Sarah Everard vigil in my constituency. Rather than safeguarding and protecting us, this Government keeps pushing through further attacks on our civil liberties.\nThis country has a proud history of protesting for change and action. From the Abolitionists to the Suffragettes, this rich tradition of dissent has paved the way for the rights and freedoms we all enjoy today.\nIn recent years we have seen millions take to the streets to draw attention to major injustices like institutional racism, attacks on our civil liberties, women’s and workers’ rights, and the climate emergency.\nBut instead of tackling issues like racism, inequality, low pay and climate breakdown, this Government is doubling down on polices that helped create them and cracking down on people who speak out against them.\nTheir Public Order Bill is an authoritarian piece of legislation that is being steamrolled through Parliament, bringing back failed measures they have tried to sneak into the Policing Act earlier this year and which were resoundingly thrown out then.\nAs well as ramping up police powers to restrict protest and expanding racially biased stop and search, the Bill will also introduce jail sentences and unlimited fines for demonstrating around national infrastructure like airports, railways, and printing presses.\nProtest banning orders could see people who have never been convicted of a criminal offence prohibited from protesting and subjected to 24/7 GPS tracking.\nThis Bill would ban the kind of protests that won votes for women. Locking on, the tactic synonymous with the Suffragettes, will be effectively criminalised, with protesters facing arrest simply for linking arms with each other.\nTime and time again, protest and activism have given a voice to the voiceless and forced us to confront real, vital issues as a country. This attempt to criminalise dissent is a threat to everyone’s fundamental right to stand up for what they believe in.\nThese measures will only serve to make protest unsafe for people from marginalised and vulnerable groups, for whom protest is often the only tool for making their voices heard.\nThe Public Order Bill will only exacerbate pre-existing racial bias and discrimination, brought in by a Government hell bent on ramping up policing powers and putting legislation forward that clearly infringes on the rights of minority groups and will worsen inequalities.\nInstead of sowing division, clamping down on dissent and hiding from accountability, they should be safeguarding our right to protest.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_scrap-tory-voter-id-laws/content_79.html": "Today’s King’s Speech brought forward legislation that will protect workers rights, nationalise our railways and tackle poverty after 14 years of Tory cruelty. This must be celebrated.\nWhilst mention was made of strengthening the integrity of elections and encouraging wide participation in the democratic process – I was saddened not to hear an explicit mention of a Democracy Bill. But it’s not too late to rid us of these racist Tory voter ID laws before the next local elections.\nStats from last month’s General Election show that people of colour were 2.5 times more likely to be stopped from voting – this is a mess Labour can fix now we are in power. As the party of ordinary workers, of diverse communities, we owe it to people to act like it.\nThe Democracy Bill had been said to include automatic voter registration – finally ridding us of the ridiculous voter registration process which makes it harder for people to have their say. It had also been set to include votes for 16s and I hoped it would scrap Voter ID laws.\n‘Gerrymandering’ in the UK\nAs a Black Labour MP, I understand how much work our party and our country still needs to do to build trust within our communities. Black and Brown people continue to face systematic discrimination from public bodies and systematic exclusion from our democratic processes.\nAccording to a report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights, over 75% of Black people in the UK do not believe their human rights are equally protected. This is damning and underlines why plans to reform voter legislation must go ahead.\nA survey from More in Common estimates that more than 400,000 people were prevented from voting in the general election due to these undemocratic Tory rules.\nThe same research shows people of colour were 2.5 times more likely to be turned away. Let’s be clear: any law that disproportionately stops Black and Brown people from participating in democracy is racist.\nThe Tories implemented these laws in the knowledge that Black and Brown people were freehistorically more likely to vote Labour and less likely to own photo ID. Don’t take my word for it – Jacob Rees Mogg himself admitted that these rules were an attempt to “gerrymander” our electoral system. They come right out of the Republican playbook and are yet another example of the vile racism I’ve experienced in politics.\nThe Tories introduced Voter ID laws on the pretence of tackling voter fraud. Yet between 2017 and 2022, when they were introduced, there were just 18 convictions. Compare this to the 400,000 people blocked from the ballot box.\nGetting out the vote\nThe 2024 election saw the lowest turnout since the introduction of universal suffrage. With laws like these in place, it’s no wonder. The Conservatives have effectively shut people out of our democratic process. Our new Labour government now has an opportunity to bring them back in.\nIf our democracy is going to work for everyone, it has to include everyone. I believe scrapping the Tories’ exclusionary Voter ID laws is another urgent priority to strengthen engagement in the democratic process.\nAfter all, this is about the kind of society we want to be and the kind of government Labour wants to be. Do we want a Britain where certain communities are systematically excluded from the democratic process?\nOr do we want a truly inclusive democracy where every eligible individual can vote and make their voice heard?\nThe Tories implemented these laws because they knew their policies could not win over a genuine majority of the country. But in democracies, voters choose their politicians; not the other way round.\nA government with confidence in its own agenda should be looking to expand participation, a commitment which was explicitly made in today’s speech. Scrapping voter ID laws is a simple way to start this work and can be achieved with a simple amendment to the Elections Act 2020. We must do this with urgency before the next local elections.\nLet’s build a democracy that truly represents all of Britain. Our communities demand it – and our democracy desperately needs it.\nThis article was first published by Labour List on 17 July 2024: https://labourlist.org/2024/07/labour-voted-id-2024-gerrymandering-voters",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_british-mps-blocked-from-entering-israel/content_20.html": "I spoke during a ministerial statement on Israel’s decision to deny two British MPs entry to the West Bank. My colleagues Yuan Yang and Abitsam Mohamed were blocked from entering after questioning by the Israeli authorities and eventually deported. They had intended to visit a range of projects run by humanitarian and development organisations.\nSince it commenced its war on Gaza, Israel has studiously prevented journalists and foreign observers from entering the territory. It is shameful but perhaps not surprising that Israel chose to block representatives of the British people from witnessing what is going on in the West Bank. It was shameful to see the leader of the Conservative Party expressing support for Israel’s decision, a sentiment which was fortunately not shared across her Party as a whole.\nThis was not just an attack on these representatives but on the people who elected them. The Foreign Secretary rightly condemned it as “disgraceful”. In my intervention, I asked for clarity on what it will take for the government to stop supplying arms for use against civilians in Gaza. Sadly, the government has seen fit to continue supplying arms in spite of a genocide case against Israel at the ICJ and the issue of ICC arrest warrants for senior Israeli politicians. This latest development adds insult to injury.",

We know that Black people are more likely to live in areas with higher concentrations of air pollution. Our own borough of Lambeth has one of the largest Black populations anywhere in London and was also home to one of our city’s most polluted roads. It was great to hear about GBMH’s extensive report into the impact this is having on pregnant Black mothers and their babies. As well as taking the necessary action at scale to tackle outdoor air pollution, it was also good to discuss the need to increase awareness around the risks of indoor air pollution like damp and mould, household chemicals, and smoke exposure.

In my first PMQ, I highlighted the Government’s reckless failure to support global vaccine equity. I followed this up the week after with a question about their deep cuts to youth services. For my third PMQ, I highlighted NHS workers protesting the Tories’ Health and Care Bill in the run-up to the NHS’s 73rd birthday.\nThousands of nurses, doctors, hospital porters and admin staff took to the streets over the weekend to protest the mismanagement of our health service and call for an end to privatisation and chronic underfunding and understaffing. I echoed their demands, calling on the Prime Minister to commit to keeping our health service publicly owned and properly funded. At this difficult time, every penny that we spend on the NHS should be going into the essential health services we all rely on. Enriching corporate shareholders and Tory party donors in the way we have during the pandemic comes at everyone else’s expense.\nHealth and Social Care Bill\nSadly, this is precisely what the Tories’ Health and Care Bill would do, normalising the corrupt contracting we have seen during the pandemic. This Bill, introduced in the same week as the NHS’s 73rd birthday, would roll out the red carpet for private companies to gain market access. At this point in time, more privatisation is the last thing our NHS needs. The Government’s handling of the pandemic has sent Covid hospitalisations soaring and created the longest waiting lists in recent NHS history. Throwing another round of privatisation into the mix is kicking it whilst it’s already down.\nWhen Labour created the NHS, the Tories voted against it no less than 22 times. Their actions now speak louder than their praise of our health service during the pandemic. For them, health is just something else waiting to be turned into a profit-making endeavour. The NHS is not safe in their hands.\nClick here to watch my video about the Tories’ NHS Corporate Takeover Bill.",

Their cruel and costly plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda are modelled on an Australian system which has been condemned by the UN for violating international laws against torture and killed twelve people – all at an inordinate expense to the taxpayer.

This crisis was decades in the making: the logical endpoint of a system where the need for short-term returns to shareholders has outweighed considerations like transitioning to renewables, insulating our homes, and other things that would have built resilience to the volatility of oil and gas prices.\n|\n|\nMaking the case for a Windfall Tax on oil and gas giants in Parliament\n|\nBut even now, there’s so much more the Government could have done. BP and Shell have already reported combined profits of £23billion on the back of this price rise, with shareholders in these companies taking home £147 billion since 2010. A windfall tax on these excess profits would have shifted the burden of the energy bills crisis away from households already struggling after 12 years of austerity. Put simply, the Government has chosen to allow oil and gas producers to continue making record profits from price rises, which are making life miserable for everyone else.\n|\nIn Parliament\nPolicing Bill\n|\n|\nSpeaking out against the Policing Bill earlier this year\n|\nThis week, the Tories reinserted a number of draconian amendments to their Policing Bill, like provisions to crack down on “noisy” protests. Concerted resistance from Peers has killed off some of the worst features of this Bill and they voted this particular amendment down again this week. But whatever final form this Bill takes, attacks on the right to protest and minoritised communities are already baked in. I fought tooth and nail to prevent this bill passing, joining protesters in the streets to try and stop it and tabling amendments to reverse some of its most discriminatory provisions. When it eventually passes, it falls on everyone who values civil liberties to stand together and build a movement that’s so big even this Government cannot just ignore it.\n|\n|\nHealth and Care Bill\n|\n|\nStanding with protesters to oppose the Health and Care Bill\n|\nThis week also saw another consideration of Lords amendments for the Health and Care Bill. There was one good piece of news emerging from this vote, with MPs voted to overturn Government plans to scrap telemedical abortion care. This was a rare pandemic gain, which saw barriers removed and reduced waiting times for women trying to access abortion care. Getting rid of this would have been a huge rollback on reproductive rights. I’m glad that MPs from across the House saw sense and put the right to choose first. But this Bill is still forcing a top-down reorganisation on the NHS at a time of real difficulty for no other reason than to roll out the red carpet for private companies.\n|\nAhead of the Spring Statement, I joined my friend Ian Byrne MP and other Socialist Campaign Group colleagues to hand in his Right to Food letter to Ten Downing Street. The levels of food insecurity afflicting our country are a direct consequence of ten years of Tory policies which have created higher and higher levels of poverty, precarity and inequality. Just this week, food banks reported they were having to refuse potato donations because people cannot afford the energy to boil them. We should put the right to food in law and hold the Government accountable for this failure.\nTrans Rights are Human Rights\n|\n|\nStanding with my friends in LGBT+ Labour\n|\nJamie Wallis’s brave decision to come out as the first trans MP this week is surely a watershed moment. And the warm reaction across the House shows that on an individual level, even MPs are capable of love and acceptance. Sadly, this compassion is not being mirrored at the level of policy. On the very day we celebrated trans visibility, the Government first appeared to row back altogether on its previous commitment to ban conversion therapy for all LGBTQ+ people. Then they clarified that they would be banning conversion therapy after all, but not for trans people. Promising to protect lesbian, gay and bisexual people while excluding trans people sends a clear message that trans people are not worthy of the same rights, dignity and safety as their peers. We still have a long fight ahead of us to build a truly inclusive society where everyone is free to be who they are.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn the constituency\nImproving Local Support for Dementia\n|\n|\nDiscussing how we can better support dementia patients locally\n|\nIt was great to hear from Alzheimer’s Society advisers Tracey and Basia about the situation facing dementia patients during the pandemic and how I can better support people in Streatham. We talked about the necessity to keep testing free for care workers and people in care homes alike and the need for wider reform of our whole social care system. This meeting has only furthered my belief that the Government’s social care plan falls short of what our community needs. It only strengthens my commitment to fight for a social care solution that meets the needs of dementia patients and everyone else with unmet care needs.\nThey also drew my attention to Lambeth Dementia Action Alliance (DAA), a local vehicle for organisations and individuals to work together to make Lambeth a more dementia friendly community, where people living with dementia are understood, respected and supported, and confident that they can contribute to community life. They are currently looking for someone to chair this vital group. If you’d be interested in this role, please email tracey.wells@alzheimers.org.uk for an informal chat.\n|\n|\nRestoring Police Trust After Child Q\n|\nThis week, I’ve also joined my Lambeth colleagues Helen Hayes MP and Florence Eshalomi MP to write to the borough commander. It emerged that Lambeth has the highest number of strip searches in London. From 2018-2021, there were 334 strip searches carried out in our borough and 216 (65%) of those searched were black. 17 of those searched were children and 11 of them were black. With community confidence in policing at an all-time low we’ve requested a meeting, asked what the justification is for these exceptionally high figures, and asked what steps will be taken to restore trust in the wake of Child Q.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOut and About in the Constituency\n|\n|\nOut and about with our Labour Mayor and our Labour Council candidates\n|\nIt was great to welcome council candidates from across the borough and our Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan to the constituency to campaign last Saturday. I spoke to residents in the new Clapham Common & Abbeville, Brixton Acre Lane and Brixton Rush Common wards, listening to the issues they wanted to raise and discussing how our candidates are looking to build on local Labour achievements over the last few years.\n|\n|\nAn Honest Conversation About Lambeth Past, Present and Future\n|\n|\nDiscussing Lambeth’s review of sites connected with slavery on BBC News\n|\nWhile the Tory Government’s response to calls to address racism remains denial and gaslighting, Lambeth’s Labour Council is doing the right thing and starting an honest conversation about our area’s links to the transatlantic slave trade. Stage one of their consultation has identified several sites honouring figures associated with the Transatlantic slave trade. For the next stage of this process, they’re consulting on how we should reimagine these sites for the 21st century. This isn’t about erasing the past – as many detractors claim – it’s about excavating it and asking why we continue to put people who profited from slavery on a pedestal.\n|\n|\n|\nNHS Parliament Awards\nThe NHS is going through one of the most difficult periods of its lifetime. Arriving hot on the heels of a decade of privatisation and underfunding, the pandemic has placed unreasonable demands on people working in our health service. I want to recognise and celebrate the efforts of people and organisations that make up our NHS. All our NHS staff are exceptional but I’m urging everyone in Streatham to tell me about individuals and organisations that have gone above and beyond over the last year. Get your nominations over to me by 5pm next Wednesday: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nCampaigning\nJustice for Belly Mujinga\n|\n|\nBelly’s loved ones add their hearts to the wall\n|\nLast weekend, Belly Mujinga should have been celebrating her 49th birthday with her family. But instead, they were mourning her loss. I joined them at the National Covid memorial wall to mark her birthday and reiterate our call for justice. With the inquest into Belly’s death slowly approaching, let’s keep her and her loved ones in our thoughts and prayers. It’s absolutely vital for her family to get some clear answers about her untimely death.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNational Covid Memorial Day\n|\n|\nAt the National Covid Memorial Wall reflecting on how much has been lost\n|\nThe first heart was painted on the National Covid Memorial Wall a year ago this week. The wall is now adorned by 180,000+ hearts – each commemorating someone who has lost their life to Covid. As well as remembering them in our thoughts and our prayers, let’s also keep fighting for an inquiry that holds those accountable. While everyone else was making huge sacrifices to keep one another safe, the corrupt cabal running the country were living it up and laughing at us. Just this week, police issued 20 fines in connection with their Downing Street parties. We heard how the Government paid £122m for unusable gowns from a company with links to a Tory Peer at a cost of £76m more than they were purchased for. This contract was personally fast tracked by Michael Gove. These things only hammer home how important it is to have a proper inquiry into everything that’s happened during the pandemic.\n|\nTo find out more about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

Established in 2019, they provide supported move-on housing to help women achieve a sustained exit through a holistic support plan that involves trauma counselling.\nThe lack of affordable housing is one of major reasons that women enter into sex work. It is also one of the biggest barriers to leaving sex work. Many women face the unenviable choice between selling sex to pay rent and falling into debt, a situation which is only getting worse with the rent crisis currently unfolding before our eyes. Orchards are currently receiving an uptick in enquiries and having to turn women away due to funding shortages.",

Staff need to be able to do their jobs and women need to be able to access reproductive healthcare without being harassed.\nDuring my time as an MP, I’ve supported measures from central and local government to introduce safe access zones around abortion clinics. One silver lining of the otherwise dreadful Public Order Act was that MPs voted through provisions to introduce safe access zones around abortion clinics. However, these powers need to be brought through via statutory instrument and it is currently unclear when the Government intends to do this. I will be calling on them to do so again when Parliament returns.\nAn alternative model for introducing a buffer zone, which I have discussed with local councillors in the past, is the option of a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO). As of October last year, 5 abortion clinics in England had PSPO enforced around them, including clinics in Bournemouth, Ealing, Twickenham, Manchester and Birmingham. With the Government dragging its feet, I’ll be helping the council to explore the implementation of this alternative option.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_challenging-the-tories-deport-first-ask-questions-later-approach/content_368.html": "The Government recently detained two of my constituents, a mother and daughter, ahead of a mass deportation flight to Jamaica. Both women have close family here. Neither has a criminal record. They arrived on a joint visitors visa, but shortly before they were due to return, her mother fell down a flight of stairs and developed a serious injury, leaving her unfit to fly. The daughter started attending school but difficulties around her immigration status led to her dropping out. In the run-up to the flight, she was detained in the infamous Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre (which would have been closed down under a Labour government).\nThis decision typifies the way the government frequently fail to make a proper assessment of individual situations and needs in their haste to deport. Thankfully, following my letter to the Home Secretary and pressure from migrant justice campaigners, the Government decided to pull them off the flight – along with the majority of those scheduled to be on it. If it had gone ahead, it would be the first flight with non-offenders on board since before the Windrush Scandal. The fact that so many people were removed from the flight offers further proof that the Home Office continues to operate under the same “deport first, ask questions later” mentality that led to the Windrush Scandal and tore friends and neighbours from our community.\nThe flight went ahead at a cost of £200,000: £50,000 a head for each of the four people the Government deported. Another reminder, as the Tories prepare to get their Nationality and Borders Bill through Parliament, that the Hostile Environment is a very expensive way of playing divide and rule.",

When the Government is asked take action on this, they often claim they don’t have enough data. This week, campaign organisation Five X More (the Secretariat of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Black Maternal Health) have released their own survey of 1,300 Black women’s experiences of UK maternity care.\nI was honoured to give a keynote speech at the Royal College of Nursing but as I told the audience, it can’t be right that we have to re-live our trauma just to be listened to. With fully 43% of the women surveyed reporting facing discrimination in maternity care, the evidence of institutional racism is there for the Government to see. Now they need to act, by setting binding targets to end these disparities once and for all.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_opposition-day-violence-against-women/content_119.html": "This week, Labour held an opposition day on the issue of violence against women. There is a clear consensus that the Government must do more to tackle this issue. In the debate, I called on them to address institutional misogyny in policing, reverse cuts to specialist services for survivors and ensure boys aren’t learning the wrong lessons in school and from culture more widely.\nIn this week’s debate, I paid tribute to my constituent Sarah Everard, who was murdered by a serving police officer a year ago this week. I argued that women must be able to trust in the Police and the Police still have a long way to go to rebuild this trust. We will not tackle violence against women until we address the institutional misogyny and culture of impunity among the people who are supposed to be prosecuting it.\nIt is impossible to discuss this issue without discussing the service cuts that have been disproportionately shouldered by women over the last twelve years. If the Tories were serious about tackling violence against women and girls, they would be reversing their own cuts to specialist services for survivors. But they aren’t and they’re not.\nWhile the causes of violence against women are far-ranging and complex, I still believe prevention is better than cure. That’s why we should be putting a greater emphasis on education and instilling a culture of care and consent in our schools. Indeed, half of school pupils reported receiving no sex education during lockdown, whilst exposure to misogyny online only increased.\nWe desperately need to get a handle on Incel culture, which seems to be indoctrinating so many young men online. I urged the Government to put greater duties on social media companies to tackle this and take content down to stop more men falling down the Incel rabbit hole.\nThese are just some of the things we need to do if we are going to start to rid our society of violence against women.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_6th-may-newsletter/content_581.html": "Fossil fuel companies are once again reporting bumper windfall profits for the first three months of the year, £4 billion in profit for BP and £7.7 billion for Shell. During the same period, Shell handed £14 to shareholders and invested £6 in fossil fuels for every £1 invested in renewables. BP paid shareholders ten times more than they invested in low carbon infrastructure. For companies like Shell and BP, the future of our planet will always come a distant second to their profit margins and delivering for shareholders.\nLast year, an estimated 3.2 million Brits on prepayment meters ran out of credit: 1 person every 10 seconds. In the same period, Shell and BP made combined profits of £55 billion: £17,440 every 10 seconds. Labour is calling on the Government to strengthen the Windfall Tax by taxing oil and gas profits at higher rates, scrapping investment loopholes that hand money back to fossil fuel companies and backdating the tax to early 2022 to capture the profits missed whilst the Tories dragged their feet. The Government needs to shift the cost of rising energy prices and climate breakdown away from struggling households and onto profiting corporations.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_14th-november-2022/content_613.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n14th November 2022\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nAt 11am on Remembrance Sunday, Streatham came together in a minute’s silence to commemorate all those from our area who gave their todays for our tomorrows and pay tribute to those who survived. We remembered all the soldiers and civilians who lost their lives in conflicts around the world. In their names, we will strive for a more peaceful world free from the horrors of war.\n|\n|\nI was also with elected representatives from across our borough in the morning to lay wreaths at Lambeth Town Hall and at the Commonwealth Memorial in Windrush Square with my colleagues Florence Eshalomi MP and Helen Hayes MP.\n|\n|\nIn the afternoon, I joined the Nubian Jak Community Trust at the Commonwealth Memorial in Windrush Square to commemorate the tens of thousands of Commonwealth soldiers who served, many making the ultimate sacrifice.\n|\n|\nIt was great to talk to some of the soldiers who served in our armed forces today, including members of the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women and Jamaican Ex-Military Veterans’ Association UK. These Remembrance Sunday events wouldn’t be possible without the committed efforts of our local community. Thank you to everyone who helped to put this year’s events on.\n|\n|\n|\nCambridge Union Debate on Reparations\n|\n|\nI was invited to participate in this week’s Cambridge Union debate on paying reparations calling for action to address the injustices and inequalities that are the legacy of slavery and colonialism. These arguments around reparations are often caricatured by the Right as handing over large sums of money for something that happened a long time ago. But the racism many of us face today have their roots in empire and reparations needs to start with simple things like fairer trade, returning stolen artefacts, and cancelling debts that have been repaid over and over. The fact that the Cambridge Union voted overwhelmingly for this shows that the call for reparations is only getting louder.\n|\n|\nUrgent Question on Asylum Accommodation\n|\n|\nI took part in last week’s Urgent Question on asylum accommodation. Some of my constituents are facing cramped conditions, bedbug infestations and unsafe food in local bridging hotels. I asked the Government to review conditions at these sites, which the new Immigration Minister described to MPs as “luxurious”. The contractors who run these substandard facilities make huge profits whilst cutting corners. If they can’t ensure basic hygiene standards, then removing their contracts is the least we should do. But the Government seems happy to turn a blind eye. I’ll be following up on this.\n|\n|\nLabour Opposition Days: Protecting Pensions\n|\n|\nWith the Government contemplating huge spending cuts, they have failed to yet rule out another real terms cut to pensions or benefits. By repeatedly u-turning on these issues, they are only adding to mounting financial worries for retirees, and especially the one quarter of London pensioners already living in poverty.\nIt’s a scandal that some retirees are already worrying about whether they can afford to turn the heating on or use the toaster. Another effective cut to pensions would add insult to injury. Abandoning the 2019 Conservative Manifesto commitment to the triple lock on state pensions for the second year in a row would leave over 9,400 pensioners in South London £868 worse off on average.\nI voted to protect the Triple Lock on pensions as part of Tuesday’s Labour Opposition Day on the issue. This week’s vote was a chance for the Tories to offer some reassurance and allay some of the uncertainty and worry facing struggling pensioners. They didn’t even turn up.\n|\n|\nStreatham Business Awards: Celebrating Streatham’s Small Businesses\n|\n|\nLast week, we celebrated the best of small business in Streatham. Local businesses have been there for our community during a period of real difficulty, supported brilliantly by Streatham BID. Small independent businesses have been left struggling to cope with the pressures of the pandemic, Brexit and the cost of living crisis. I remember those uncertain early days of the pandemic when we saw local coffee shops providing free coffee to NHS workers, local computer shops repairing laptops at no cost, and a local firm laser-cutting PPE for local care workers facing a total shortage.\nStreatham’s small independent businesses have proved that they are not just the lifeblood of our local economy but the lifeblood of the community. It’s really saddening to see the continued closure of local traders, who are being driven out by rising rents, soaring energy bills and above all, the very real financial uncertainty facing our country. It makes it all the more important to celebrate their contributions and remember we must use them or lose them.\n|\n|\nVisiting Sunnyhill Primary School\n|\n|\nJoining Sunnyhill Primary School for their Monday morning assembly was the perfect start to a last week. They shared their brilliant Black History Month song with me and asked me some great questions about my role as an MP. I was also really impressed by the artwork kids drew for this year’s Black History Month display. As I often point out in Parliament, teachers are making the effort to integrate Black History Month in a way that the government should be emulating. Black history is British history. It should be taught in our schools year-round.\n|\n|\nYouth Work Week 2022: London Youth Awards\n|\n|\nIt was great to kick off Youth Work Week 2022 at the London Youth Awards in a ceremony that brought our city’s youth sector together to celebrate the impact of youth work and the people who make it happen. I was proud to present the ‘Creating a Better London Award’ to Youth Realities for their work on building inclusive and safe spaces for young people from minoritised or marginalised groups. Youth Work gives young people the opportunities to gain confidence, learn new skills and find passions. But after a decade which saw youth services slashed by 70%, the sector is stretched thin. We need to invest more in our youth services and our young people.\n|\n|\nSolidarity with Nurses and Tube Workers\n|\n|\nLast Thursday saw tube workers walking out on strike to protect jobs, work-life balance, and pensions. I joined striking workers on the picket lines at Brixton and Elephant & Castle. These Tube strikes are happening because of the Tories’ determination to ransom TfL over Covid revenue losses. The funding deal foisted on TfL this year mandated it to pursue pay restraint at a time of rising prices, waste time and resources on “driverless trains” and look to cut pensions. TfL needs to do as tube workers are asking for: shelve its plans to cut station staff jobs, withdraw its threats to existing agreements and commit to not attacking the TfL pension scheme. Solidarity with members of the RMT.\nThe Royal College of Nurses voted for the first strike action in their 106-year history last Wednesday. If that doesn’t show the scale of the crisis facing workers in our NHS, I don’t know what does. Nurses have my full solidarity and support. The Government must end the low pay and understaffing driving nurses out of our health service. That means committing to a proper cost of living pay rise and setting out plans to reverse a decade of real terms pay cuts for NHS workers.\n|\n|\nBlack Maternal Health Report\n|\n|\nThis week saw the publication of the latest MBRRACE report. This report reveals that Black women in the UK are over three times more likely to die during and after pregnancy and childbirth. It’s not enough for the Government to simply say they are listening. They need to move beyond words by setting binding targets to end racial health disparities in maternity care, as Labour has recently pledged to do. The colour of a mother’s skin should have no impact on her baby’s health or her own.\n|\n|\nFighting for Compensation with the WASPI Campaign\n|\n|\nRapid changes to the pension age affecting 3.8 million retired women have left many facing financial hardship. I met with Debbie and Angela from the WASPI campaign team this week to follow up on Labour Conference meeting and discuss how we can push forwards their fight for fast and fair compensation.\n|\n|\nMeeting with Debt Justice\n|\n|\nAt a time when countries urgently need resources to tackle the pandemic and climate emergency, more and more cash is being drained to wealthy lenders through debt payments. This week, I met with Debt Justice to discuss how fighting debt is integral to fighting the crises facing countries in the Global South. We must push for debt cancellation to allow climate-vulnerable countries to focus resources on tackling these pressing issues.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_this-tory-government-isnt-serious-about-the-climate-emergency/content_436.html": "From the Australian bush fires to killer heatwaves, floods and extreme weather – it couldn’t be clearer that we are in the midst of a climate emergency. Already, many of the world’s poorest people – who have done the least to cause this crisis – are being hit first and worst by the impacts. Scientists are warning us that time is running out to act. What we do in the next few years will be decisive for future generations and the planet.\nIn response to the crisis, we’ve seen a remarkable movement rise up across the world – giving us hope. Greta Thunberg, the youth climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion are calling for urgent action. I’m proud to stand alongside the climate movement because they are right – we need bold action and we need it now. The Conservatives’ recent decision to blacklist legitimate climate organisations like Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace as terrorist organisations is a travesty. It should only drive us to ramp up the climate protest movement.\nBoris Johnson’s government caps off ten years of Tory failure to tackle the climate crisis. During the General Election, Johnson didn’t even turn up to Channel 4’s climate debate, choosing instead to send his dad. The climate emergency only saw 10 mentions in the entire Conservative manifesto. Just like his predecessors, he’s not serious about tackling the climate emergency.\nWhether it’s supporting fracking, Heathrow expansion or fossil fuels subsidies, Johnson will continue to promote policies that benefit some of the worst polluters at the expense of the rest of the planet. As the Conservatives continue to put profit before people, we need our elected Labour representatives to speak up and get out on the front-lines of the climate struggle.\nI was elected on a radical climate manifesto which proposed a Green Industrial Revolution to create hundreds of thousands of green jobs and secure a just transition to a low carbon economy. I’ll continue to make the case for our inspiring environmental policies, which have the backing of scientists, trade-unionists and a strong base of public support. It’s essential that we keep the climate crisis at the top of the news agenda in the coming years.\nWe need to clean up our air, end fuel poverty and protect animals and wildlife. The world can’t wait five years for a Labour government, so we have to find ways of putting pressure on the Conservatives now. Winning power locally, building protest movements and winning people over to a radical alternative all have a part to play in this process.\nAbove all, we need to make sure people understand that climate change is a class issue. Tackling climate change means tackling inequality on a global scale. The richest 10% produce 50% of global carbon emissions. With America reneging on its international climate commitments, it’s important we uphold our international obligation to bring emissions down.\nBut we also face massive environmental inequalities right here at home. Across Lambeth, just 43% of homes are well-insulated. This is reflected in the fact that nearly 1 in 10 people live in fuel poverty and struggle to pay their energy bills. In 2020, people shouldn’t have to choose between eating or heating their home. Retrofitting homes to decent environmental standards would bring household heating costs down and reduce fuel consumption.\nSince 2010, air pollution has been at illegal levels across London. In 2018, Brixton Road (just up from my constituency office) breached annual air pollution limits before the end of January. As many of us travel to work, make the school run or pop out to the shops, we breathe in abnormally high levels of air pollution. It’s vital we work hard to clean up our air so that children are no longer having their lives cut short because of toxic levels of pollution.\nWe know what the solutions are to the climate crisis: a massive expansion of improved public transport, a rapid switch towards renewable clean energy, solar panels on 1.75 million roofs, a ban on fracking and a mass insulation programme. I welcome Sadiq Khan’s recent announcement of a Green New Deal for London, which commits to bring down our city’s carbon emissions to net-zero by 2030. Let’s hope this can light the way for future Labour administrations at a local and national level.",

Like its predecessors, the government has been unable to produce any evidence that cutting benefits would work on its stated terms of forcing people back into work. The evidence produced thus far suggests that they would push at least 300,000 people into poverty—including 50,000 children. They are likely to be disastrous for disabled people’s incomes and their independence.\nPolicy experts from Scope were keen to stress that whilst saving money for central government they will largely shift care costs onto families and local authorities, who are less-equipped to bear it. As I pointed out in an article for Politics.co.uk, there is a body of evidence which shows that a punitive approach to welfare is actually an obstacle to people engaging with back-to-work support. We need a new, more compassionate approach.",

Helping people with sky-high energy bills? Tackling the climate crisis? Ending chronic NHS staff shortages? Of course not. It’s another piece of authoritarian anti-protest legislation to make it harder for people to protest against them for failing to tackle any of these things.\nFrom the Abolitionists to the Suffragettes and the Chartists, our country’s rich tradition of dissent paved the pathway for the rights and freedoms we all enjoy today. This Bill comes hot on the heels of the Policing, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Act. I’ll be campaigning inside and outside Parliament to stop this. I tabled a reasoned amendment to throw this Bill out, which has received cross-party support from Labour MPs along with Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the Greens.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn Parliament\nWe Need Action on the Cost of Living Crisis\nIn this week’s Tory budgeting tips, the Government told people struggling to afford the basics that they should “take more hours or move to a better job”. A ridiculous comment coming from the party of zero-hours contracts, stagnant wages and benefit cuts. Labour gave the Government a chance to help people instead of lecturing them this week, proposing an emergency budget and a windfall tax on the North Sea oil and gas companies making millions of everyone else’s misery. But the Government voted these both down, leaving all but a tiny minority of shareholders high and dry.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThe Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh – Urgent Question\n|\n|\nLast week, Al Jazeera reported that their journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot in the head by an Israeli sniper whilst covering an IDF raid on a refugee camp in the illegally occupied West Bank. She was wearing a flak jacket with “Press” written on it. Her producer was also shot in the back. In this week’s Urgent Question on Shireen’s murder and the attacks on her pallbearers and mourners as they tried to lay her to rest, I made two points. Firstly, that Palestinians are being denied dignity even in death. Secondly, that the Government’s failure to recognise Palestine and treat Palestinians as an equal party in the peace process is a massive stumbling block. How can they say they want a two-state solution whilst refusing to recognise one of the states involved?\n|\n|\nNew Vision 4 Women Empowerment Workshop\n|\n|\nIt was a pleasure to welcome New Vision 4 Women and Amazing Women Global to Parliament to deliver an empowerment workshop this week. Founded by my constituent Nighat Khan, New Vision 4 Women run a range of services to transform the lives of women, helping with everything from family life to employment skills, digital learning, health and civic education. I’m always proud to support them in all they do.\nMullivaikkal Remembrance Day\n|\n|\nEvery year, Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day is observed by Tamil people to remember the tens of thousands who died in the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Our Government has received several significant submissions detailing the human rights abuses inflicted in Sri Lanka but has not acted on them. Labour’s 2019 manifesto promised to work through the UN and the Commonwealth to insist on the protection of human rights for Sri Lanka’s minority Tamil and Muslim populations. I was proud to join Tamils for Labour this week and reiterate my commitment to holding the perpetrators of these atrocities accountable, including through sanctions.\n|\n|\n|\nIn and around Streatham\nMaking Streatham Safer\n|\n|\nI understand people are really concerned by last week’s shooting on Brixton Hill and the other recent shootings in our area. Making Streatham safer for everyone is an absolute priority for me as your MP. I’ve been in touch with the Borough Commander and will be meeting with the Police and the Council to discuss their plans to keep the community safe over the summer months. As well as responding to incidents of serious violence, we also need a long-term strategy with a laser focus on prevention: a public health approach to violent crime which encompasses everything from early interventions and mental health support to reversing youth service cuts, ending school exclusions and a much greater emphasis on community policing.\nSave Streatham’s Station Ticket Offices\n|\n|\nRecently amended guidance around changing ticket office opening hours appears to clear the way for train operating companies to close down rail station ticket offices across the country, including all three of Streatham’s station ticket offices. Our station ticket offices are absolutely vital for accessibility and passenger safety. That’s why I’ve launched a petition this week with our Labour Councillor for St Leonard’s, Martin Abrams, to save our station ticket offices. Please sign and share it to protect jobs and keep our stations safe and accessible.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGiving Kids the Best Start in Life\n|\n|\nLEAP Lambeth helps give 0-3 year olds in our area the best possible start in life, supporting local families with their children’s nutritional, social, emotional and verbal development. It was great join their annual awards ceremony this week to celebrate the work of local family-oriented organisations and hand out a Unique Innovation Award to local children’s activity group Whippersnappers for their engaging work helping children to express themselves.\nEid Party for Refugees\n|\n|\nThank you to everyone who came along to my Eid Party for local refugee families last weekend but particularly to New Vision 4 Women, Ash Shahada Housing Association, and all those who painted faces, contributed gifts, prepared food and helped to put a smile on everyone’s faces. With the Government’s ongoing attack on refugees, it’s always good to remember that these aren’t the values of our welcoming community.\n|\n|\nDementia Action Week\n|\n|\nIt was great to round off Dementia Action week with a with a team dementia awareness session in the constituency office, kindly facilitated by Alzheimer’s Society. Every year, the Alzheimer’s Society works with individuals and organisations across the UK to encourage people to ‘act on dementia’ and make communities more dementia-friendly.\n|\nCatching up with Local Nurses\nThis week I also met with the Royal College of Nurses to hear about the realities of nursing in South London. Our NHS staff are doing an incredible job under incredible strain. There’s a Brexit-shaped hole in our NHS, with EU recruitment down 90% since the referendum result. NHS England has nearly 40,000 unfilled nursing posts, with the number of nurses leaving our NHS hitting a four-year high this week. With so many nurses facing burnout, it’s clear we need a long-term workforce plan, safe staffing levels, better mental health support and a proper pay rise for NHS workers.\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

I voiced my gratitude for the incredible work of local councils and community organisations in increasing testing, reducing stigma, and ensuring people know their status. When caught early, HIV is treatable. While testing rates are high among some groups, they are low with others. Testing is quick, easy, and lifesaving.\nLooking ahead, I hope for greater international action and I look forward to the Government’s new HIV action plan this summer.",

After considerable reflection, I have decided that I cannot in good conscience vote in favour of The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, tabled by the Member of Parliament for Spen Valley.\nI sympathise with the deeply held personal arguments in favour of assisted dying. I believe there is a genuine need to consider legislative changes that will give people greater autonomy over how they choose to end their lives, particularly in instances of unbearable suffering from terminal illness.\nHowever, I have significant concerns about the current proposals in this legislation. Chief among these is the lack of sufficient safeguards to protect vulnerable individuals, particularly those from lower economic backgrounds, from the risk of coercion. In the context of our overstretched health and social care system, I fear the potential for undue pressure being placed on individuals who may feel they have no other choice. Regrettably, the Bill does not adequately address these issues.\nFurthermore, this is an extraordinarily sensitive and complex matter that demands thorough debate and scrutiny. Unfortunately, I do not believe sufficient time has been allocated for Parliament to explore all the ethical, medical, and social implications of this legislation.\nGiven the profound moral considerations involved, I cannot abstain from this vote. It is a matter of conscience, and to support the Bill in its current form would be inconsistent with my responsibilities both to my constituents and to my principles.\nWhile I remain open to the possibility of considering future legislation on assisted dying, I will be voting against The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill on the 29th November. I know there are strongly held views on both sides of this debate, and I will continue to listen to all perspectives. I hope Parliament will be given adequate time in the near future to have a thorough discussion on end-of-life care and assisted dying, and that these matters will be treated with the seriousness and care they deserve.",

Things have changed a lot since then and this Friday, I had the opportunity to get along to their Clapham Common campus to speak with staff and students about their experiences in local further education. It was great talking to health and social care students and discussing everything from work placements to transport links, and how and why I became an MP.\nLambeth College do a fantastic job of providing skills and training to local young people but they’re doing things in a difficult context. Per pupil funding levels for Sixth Formers have been frozen since 2014, leaving schools and colleges with less money to spend on front line services. While the Government’s announcement of a slight funding increase in September welcome, it is far from enough to provide the supportive infrastructure our young people need.\nOnly one in four young people is able to receive help from a mental health professional. At a time where teachers are raising alarms over student mental health, we’ve seen counselling services dismantled. Enrichment courses and careers advice have also suffered to the detriment of our young.\nSchool Food Plan Alliance\nAfter Lambeth College, it was onto Parliament, where I met up with the School Food Plan Alliance to discuss news that the Government will review the policy of Universal Free Infant School Meals ahead of its latest budget. They highlighted academic research which suggests these normalise healthy eating and are generally far more nutritionally balanced than most packed lunches.I’ll be tabling some questions on this soon. Watch this space.\nA Better Budget for Education\nWith the budget coming up, it’s vital Labour put pressure on the Conservatives to invest properly in education to meet basic educational needs and unlock the full potential of everyone in our area. The Government has announced modest spending increases for further education, which are welcome but these will still keep us way last Labour Government.",

The Government needs to start treating race as a Covid risk factor.\nIn the UK, coronavirus has ignited the touchpaper on health inequalities stoked by decades of negligent government policy. The last ten months have been an awful reminder that an unequal society is an unhealthy society.\nAs citizens on the sharp end of inequality in one of the most unequal countries in the OECD, it’s increasingly clear that Britain’s Black, Asian and ethnic minority communities are suffering even more than most during the pandemic.\nCovid-19 patients from these communities have been hospitalised at almost three times the rate of white British people. According to the government’s own statistics, Black men and men from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds aged under 65 have a more than five times higher risk of related mortality compared to men from a white British background. These findings leave the government with no excuse for their inaction.\nToo often during this pandemic, ministers and mainstream media have chosen to focus on cultural or even biological reasons for the poor health outcomes of Black, Asian and ethnic minorities. This discounts the obvious fact that the employment and housing circumstances of people from BAME communities place them in contact with more people and heighten their risk of getting Covid-19. No amount of Vitamin D will fix this.Related\nWe can’t make the same mistakes with the vaccine. Ministers have rightly prioritised the clinically vulnerable in their vaccination rollout, acknowledging age and pre-existing medical health conditions as risk factors. But the failure to treat race as a risk factor shows they are still not taking structural racism seriously.\nMy colleague Apsana Begum MP has been leading the charge on this issue in Parliament. Just this week, she pressed the Prime Minister on prioritising BAME communities for vaccination and asked if he acknowledged that structural racism had led to these health disparities. In his response, he denied its existence.\nA recent Joint Human Rights Committee report into Black people’s human rights revealed that 60% of Black people don’t feel the NHS protects their health to the same level as white people’s. This statistic is also closely mirrored in the Sage study which found up to 72% of Black people said they were unlikely to take the vaccine.\nPeople from BAME communities have been more likely to receive fines for minor Covid breaches whilst government advisers have openly flouted these. Coupled with the government’s duplicitous record during the pandemic, it is clear that these issues of trust have only deepened in recent days.\nOf course, these problems go even deeper. Until the government accepts that the inequalities faced by BAME people are a driving force behind poor health outcomes, we are only going to see more of the same.\nThe Royal College of GPs has argued for the government to prioritise BAME communities for vaccination and run targeted public health campaigns to build confidence in the vaccine.\nWe also need culturally competent guidance during the vaccine rollout that addresses the additional risks people face from overcrowded housing and unsafe workplaces.\nFinally, we must rigorously record ethnicity data to monitor uptake of the vaccine and be able to course correct quickly when things go wrong.\nI was pleased to add my name to Apsana Begum MP’s recent call to put BAME communities at the heart of the vaccination drive. There is a mountain to climb if the government is to gain community confidence after decades of systemic neglect. This would be a step in the right direction.\nThis article was first published on Politics Home on 22nd January: https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/government-must-put-bame-communities-at-the-heart-of-the-covid-vaccination-drive",

Whilst police officers undeniably have a difficult job and work under exceptional pressures, this trial shows nobody is above the law. When anyone loses their life after contact with the police, it is vital that this is properly investigated.\nThe fatal shooting of Chris Kaba caused considerable fear, anger and pain not only in our community but in communities across London.

Not a single Tory MP voted against it. Rather than addressing the growing injustices of our time, they are firmly united behind silencing the people who raise them.\nToday’s protests are the milestones of tomorrow’s progress. The Conservatives’ decision to ram through a Bill criminalising the act of protest and infringing the right to free assembly is an insult to everyone who wants to build a better future. During the pandemic, we saw the damaging effect of the decision to break up protests that the Government disagreed with and giving Police ill-defined powers to break up protest. This Bill will only make the scenes at the Clapham Common vigil for Sarah Everard more commonplace.\nIt is also clear that the provisions outlined in the Policing Bill will fall disproportionately on under-represented social groups. Indeed, some are even designed to. Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller communities recognised by the United Nations as among the most persecuted groups in the world. The Government should be ensuring they have safe places to go and protecting them from hate crimes. Instead, they are introducing legislation outlawing their way of life.\nThis week, I called on MPs to protect under-represented communities and defend the right to protest.

For a long time, these groups have actively cultivated anti-migrant sentiment. They attempt to redirect justifiable anger about the housing crisis, crumbling public services and falling living standards towards migrants and away from the people in our society with wealth and power. The summer riots show where such racist and Islamophobic narratives can lead.\nIn Clapham and Brixton Hill, our community has a long and distinguished history of anti-racist and anti-fascist campaigning. We will always stand united in the face of attempts to divide us through misinformation, hatred and violence. We saw beautiful scenes of solidarity and unity as anti-fascists turned to drive back the far right across the country and show that our communities will not be divided by their hatred, their violence or their racism.

He dodged the question, claiming he believes in “free speech” but his government’s actions say differently. I also asked Sunak for clarity around the publication timeframe for the Pitchford Inquiry into undercover policing.

It offers a crucial backstop for those who cannot easily do these things online or need to do so in person.\nClosure would force residents to travel further to access these essential in-person services. Coming against a wider backdrop of local bank branch closures, its loss would have particularly damaging implications for elderly and digitally excluded members of our community.\nFranchising will disrupt these essential services and is likely to result in an ultimate reduction to the overall service level. It typically means smaller branches, fewer staff, slower transactions, longer queues and worse customer service. The recent sell-off of WH Smith also underscores the precarity of this model, with potential knock-on impacts on the postal services such franchises provide.\nWe must protect our postal services and maintain the current standard of provision that people rely on.

What is new is more and more people waking up to this injustice and demanding change.\nWith the company refusing to even negotiate, British Gas workers have been left with no choice but to go on strike. It’s completely wrong for a profitable company to try and use a crisis as an excuse to force their workers to do more hours for less money with reduced rights.\nWhen we allow big companies to fire their entire workforce and rehire them on worse terms, this sends a shockwave through the wider economy. The more companies are allowed to do this, the more likely it is to have a knock-on effect, bringing down standards in other companies too. After a decade of wage stagnation for the vast majority of people, we simpky cannot afford this as we rebuild from Covid.\nThat’s why, as well as standing with British Gas workers to Stop the British Gas Fire, I’m echoing their call to outlaw the practice of fire and rehire altogether.\nSupport British Gas workers in their fight for fair pay and conditions: https://www.gmb.org.uk/campaign/back-british-gas-workers",

Care homes were devastated in the early phases of the pandemic as the Government discharged hospital patients into homes without tests and failed to provide staff with PPE.\nThe pandemic has been a reminder of who does the really useful work in our society. We need a long-term strategy to fix social care.

Where’s this money coming from? Straight out of our public services: out of schools, hospitals, people’s benefits, state pensions, and emergency services.\nEven the financial markets recognised that running the economy for a handful of wealthy people isn’t a remotely credible strategy for growth. The pound is plummeting. Pension funds are under threat, mortgages are being withdrawn and prices are soaring even higher.\n|\n|\nLabour is calling on the Government to recall Parliament, reverse this millionaires’ budget and deliver real lasting support for households. The Tories are driving the economy off a cliff to put more money in the pockets of the super rich 1%. It’s time for a Labour Government that will stand up for the 99%.\n|\n|\nEnough is Enough\n|\n|\nNow more than ever, the country needs a Labour Government. But with the Tories launching an all-out offensive against working people, we can’t wait until the next election for action. Instead of listening to people struggling to afford basics like energy, food and rent, the Tories are handing out billions to corporations and the super rich. They’re taking us for mugs.\nYesterday I joined people up and down the country to demand real support for working people and say Enough is Enough. Speaking outside King’s Cross, I urged everyone to stand together, be bold, and keep demanding a real alternative.\n|\n|\nLabour Conference 2022\n|\n|\nI was up in Liverpool this week for the annual Labour Party Conference, talking to some of the members and movements that make up our party. It’s always good to discuss the issues facing our society and hone our solutions. Now more than ever, we need to push for policies to tackle inequality and hardwire economic and social justice into our economy.\n|\n|\nLabour Conference brought some welcome policy announcements. Among others, we saw commitments to bring rail back into public ownership, move to 100% clean power by 2030, create a sovereign wealth fund, insulate 19 million homes and build more council housing.\nThese policies put genuine distance between Labour’s aspirational vision for the country and the Conservatives’ increasingly unhinged attempts to lavish money on the very richest at the expense of everyone else. We have announced policies will start to address the crises we face – from the climate emergency to the housing crisis – and been rewarded with a commanding polling lead.\nBut if we’re going to address these issues in a way that leaves no one behind we’ll need to go further still. There were also some major policy commitments on the conference floor this year, with Labour members voting to renationalise Royal Mail, inflation-proof pay, a £15 an hour minimum wage and an end to NHS privatisation. As a mass membership party, Labour should be taking these up as policy.\n|\n|\nStanding with Striking Workers\n|\nThis week has brought another round of strike action, with workers standing up for real pay rises to cope with the cost of living crisis. Solidarity with members of Unite, the University and Colleges Union, the Communication Workers’ Union, and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers.\n|\n|\nI was proud to join Labour colleagues on the picket line in Liverpool to show solidarity with striking dock workers, who are facing a real terms pay cut from another highly profitable company.\n|\n|\nCollege staff pay has lagged behind inflation by 35% since 2009, leaving many struggling. As they face another huge real terms pay cut this year, this Friday saw staff at thirty colleges launching strike action for better pay. I sent my solidarity to striking workers at Lambeth College in our constituency.\n|\n|\nFull solidarity with postal workers standing firm on the picket line this week and stepping up strike action against Royal Mail in response to the company’s attempts to impose real terms pay cuts, shred their terms and conditions and move towards derecognising their union. And like other workers, they deserve a real pay rise.\n|\n|\nIt was great to see so many people turning out in support of striking rail workers over the weekend. Train companies paid shareholders almost £800,000,000 last year. Now they’re saying they have to cut rail workers’ pay and rip up terms and conditions just to stay afloat. Denying decent pay and job security only benefits greedy rail companies. But better conditions for workers means a better service for commuters.\n|\n|\nMeeting with Climate Campaigners\n|\n|\nLast year, the Government announced a Just Transition Energy Partnership to support South Africa’s push to decarbonise its economy. On Friday, I met with climate justice campaigners from Groundwork South Africa at the Friends of the Earth office in Stockwell to discuss progress on this scheme to date.\nCampaigners are understandably worried about transparency and a lack of public participation, with South African civil society shut out of scrutiny of this deal so far. They want to know what conditions will be attached to this money. Money going to the global south cannot be used to fund fossil fuels; it must be conditional on renewable investment, with governments in the global south able to deliver on funding in a way that prioritises the people who live there.\nThey also made it clear to me that every single new oil and gas project licensed in the UK is a setback in the struggle for clean energy in South Africa and the wider global south. I’ll continue to scrutinise this partnership to ensure government green rhetoric becomes a reality and that it is delivered in a way that prioritises climate justice for the Global South ahead of corporate interests in the Global North.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

I called on the Government to set a binding target to remove flammable cladding from homes by June 2022, the fifth anniversary of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. I also reiterated the call to protect leaseholders from the astronomical costs associated with making buildings safe. Sadly, they rejected these amendments. They have promised to protect leaseholders from the costs of remediation work no less than 17 times but they’ve now voted against this 6 times. They really don’t seem to have a plan to fix this.\nResearch released this week by End Child Poverty revealed that 8,150 children in Streatham are growing up trapped in poverty. That’s more than one in three. In London, sky rocketing housing costs are one of the main things that push people into poverty.

Although Ofcom, the regulator, has announced an investigation into Royal Mail’s performance during the year 2022/23, this is not good enough.\nThe company’s recent management teams have made a very good case for taking it back into public ownership. I would urge Ofcom to take stronger enforcement action as a regulator and investigate Royal Mail’s performance across multiple years, while also accepting evidence directly from postal workers.

She was on her period and did not have an adult present. But we’ve had apologies before and it’s taken two years to even wring this out of the Met.\nIn Parliament, I secured and led an Urgent Question asking the Government how they plan to address these issues and prevent such abuses from happening in future. There is no apology that could atone for the perverse and racist degradation of Child Q, only action to ensure no child has to endure what she went through again.\nThis comes as the latest in a long string of racist and misogynistic incidents within the Met. The first step in addressing an issue is admitting it exists. I was therefore disappointed that the Government chose to delay justice by suggesting it was unclear whether this was a one-off or part of a bigger pattern. They continue to refuse to acknowledge institutional racism in policing, let alone spell out a plan to address it. In the same week they did this, we got a clearer picture of the scale of this issue.\nAn FOI request revealed that the Met strip searched 5,279 children in the past 3 years – nearly 5 children a day. 75% of the children strip searched were from ethnic minority backgrounds. 16 of them were aged 10-12. What’s it going to take for acknowledgement that what happened to Child Q is not an isolated incident but part of a structural problem. It’s not just that these issues exist, it’s that those in a position to do something about them are reluctant to discuss and expose them. This month, the Daniel Morgan inquiry concluded that “the MPS has often shown a reluctance to examine, admit and learn from past mistakes and failures”, another reminder that we will not address these issues without improving accountability and transparency in policing.\nThat’s why Labour Black women MPs issued a joint statement calling on the Home Secretary to appoint a new Met Commissioner who acknowledges the depth of this issue and will take proportionate action to address it and restore confidence in the police, which is at an all-time low.\nAbove all, we must not let the Government off the hook for failing to put in place the things that we know would cut crime: whether it’s reversing cuts and investing in youth services, addressing school exclusions, or taking a public health approach to drugs and violent crime.",

Initially started to tackle Covid misinformation, a recent investigation from civil liberties charity Big Brother Watch found comprehensive evidence that they have subsequently been used to monitor a range of people who criticise government policy: politicians, activists, journalists and others who speak out.\n|\n|\nI also asked Sunak for clarity around the publication timeframe for the Pitchford Inquiry into undercover policing. It’s very worrying indeed that the Government has passed several bills ramping up state powers to crack down on protest and activist movements before finding out how much damage this has already done. At PMQs, I asked Rishi Sunak how much public money has been spent spying on political opponents under the guise of tackling misinformation and whether he thought this was justifiable. He dodged the question, claiming he believes in “free speech” but his government’s actions say differently.\n|\n|\n|\nSupporting the NHS Workers Who Support Us\n|\n|\nThis week saw more mass walkouts of NHS workers in England, with nurses and ambulance workers leading the biggest strike in NHS history on Monday, physiotherapists out on Thursday, and ambulance workers out once again yesterday.

Not just because it’s the right thing to do; but because the consequences of losing valuable staff in our NHS are all too plain to see. Solidarity with NHS workers fighting for a safer health service for everyone.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSupport for Turkey and Syria\n|\nMy thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Turkey and Syria impacted by earthquakes, especially those who have lost loved ones.

With the death toll now standing at 21,000 and people in both countries facing renewed threats from cold weather, we must provide all the support we can. As well as maximising our humanitarian aid, all damaging sanctions on both countries should be lifted until they fully recover.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVisiting Bishop Thomas Grant School\n|\n|\nIt was great to start my Friday with another visit to Bishop Thomas Grant School politics students to answer their questions about my role as an MP and discuss the issues that matter to them.

Rising demand and restricted access to care in many areas is putting unprecedented pressure on reproductive healthcare services, with some women now waiting weeks or travelling miles for appointments.\nAlongside the staffing and funding pressures afflicting our entire health service, staff also contend with the added pressure of frequent anti-abortion protests outside the clinic. The presence of a vocal minority of individuals seeking to shame those accessing the clinic has been a regular occurrence for some time but I was very concerned to hear this has become a weekly feature in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs Wade.\nWith no shortage of politicians piping up from the Tory benches, the anti-abortion movement in the UK seems emboldened. Disgraced former Tory MP Scott Benton retweeted a Republican Party post celebrating the Supreme Court verdict. Another, Danny Kruger, also defended the decision, suggesting that the status quo of abortion provision was a “proper matter for political debate”. Meanwhile Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg recently called abortion a “cult of death”.\nWhile the issue is not polarised along party political lines in the same way as in the US, we should not be fooled into thinking it can’t happen here. By cracking down on the right to protest, curtailing workers’ rights, and passing voter suppression legislation, the Tories have already shown they are all-too comfortable stealing from the Republican playbook.\nMeanwhile, abortion has never been fully decriminalised in the UK. Just this year, a mother-of-three was jailed for 28 months after terminating her pregnancy. While this sentence was rightly overturned, it is a reminder that women can still be prosecuted under Victorian-era laws for abortion.\nRight of assembly, expression and religion should not come at the expense of other rights; not least a woman’s legal right to healthcare. Women should be able to access medical services without fear of harassment or intimidation. That is why I have raised these protests with Lambeth council and supported legislation to introduce safe access zones around local clinics. I am also supportive of efforts for legal reform to recognise abortion as a healthcare issue foremost; not a criminal one. Finally, we have to address the wider crisis in our NHS so that women can access these services in a timely manner.

Across the UK, hundreds of thousands of British children have been priced out of claiming their right to citizenship.\nIt’s thanks to the brilliant work of campaign groups like Citizens UK (in particular the local Lambeth Citizens branch), Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens (PRCBC) and Amnesty International that this issue has been brought to light.\nIn 2019, there were 421,000 children born in the UK who were not registered as British citizens. In the same year, a further 177,000 children raised in the UK for at least 10 years were unregistered.\nThese children will experience real difficulties as a consequence of this in later life, falling victim to some of the same Hostile Environment measures which were brought to light during the Windrush Scandal and remain in place today.\nThey will face barriers when it comes to accessing healthcare, taking up employment, attending university, renting a home and opening a bank account through absolutely no fault of their own.\nThe most immediate stumbling block to most families seeking to register their children is the sheer cost of registration. This has risen from £35 in 1983 to £1012 in 2020, increasing at almost ten times the rate of inflation and almost doubling in the last decade alone. Of the current fee, just £372 accounts for actual administrative costs. The remaining £640 is pure profit.\nThese same households face higher levels of hardship and poverty. Some families also live with the devastating No Recourse to Public Funds condition, preventing them from accessing basic services. It cannot be right that the Home Office is able to turn a 64% profit whilst children from poor households are deprived of citizenship.\nOver the last ten years, the unchecked rise of fees has driven a sharp decline in registrations, leaving more and more children facing barriers across many areas of their lives.\nWe need to look at drastically reducing these fees, introducing waivers for those who cannot afford them and ensuring the burden of such costs is borne by central government, not cash-strapped local authorities.\nI was glad that Boris Johnson committed to looking at this policy again in light of my recent question and will be holding him to this.

Unfortunately, I did not receive a positive response from the Home Office Minister, who ignored straightforward questions about whether those on the flight had received legal advice and proper safeguarding practices had been followed.

Most people in modern Britain owe our lives to a midwife but failures to address chronic staff shortages and invest in maternity services now leave staff facing unmanageable strains. Midwifery services are at breaking point, with shortages of more than 2,000 midwives in England alone. For every 30 midwives that train to enter the profession, 29 are leaving or never entering the workforce and 57 per cent of midwives surveyed last year were considering leaving the NHS.\nAs the Royal College of Midwives has said: “Not a day goes by that we don’t hear of a maternity service having to close temporarily, suspend services or divert women to other maternity units just because there simply aren’t enough midwives.” This is having an undeniable impact on midwives’ ability to deliver the high standard of care mothers deserve.\nThis retention and recruitment crisis is inseparable from the Tories’ casual degradation of NHS workers over the last 12 years. According to analysis from the Trades Union Congress, midwives’ pay is down by £5,657 in real terms since the Tories took power, falling by £1,564 this year alone. As pay has fallen in real terms year on year, so has the number of midwives, increasing the burden on those who tough it out and placing mothers at greater risk. Meanwhile, as many as 30 per cent of all mothers rate their birth as traumatic.\nThere is a mistaken belief that people should put up with lower pay in exchange for undertaking meaningful work. The situation facing midwives shows this sacrificial logic hurts staff and the public services they keep running.\nThe Government can’t say they weren’t warned. A year on from last year’s ground-breaking March with Midwives, nothing has changed. After the Royal College of Nurses voted to strike for the first time in their 106-year history, the Royal College of Midwives is balloting this autumn. As so often, industrial action seems to be the only way to make this Government listen.\nIt doesn’t need to be this way. All midwives want is the resources to do their job safely and provide care.

At a time when Black communities experienced routine harassment from the police and the National Front, she fought fearlessly against police brutality and for racial justice. She pioneered an intersectional approach that sought to tackle multiple oppressions, fighting for equality in education, housing and employment.\nOlive Morris achieved more in her 27 years than many do in an entire lifetime of activism.

Indeed, “his”-story would literally have us believe that the victor is more often than not a man. A white man. So it was refreshing to see The Woman King, a story of sheroism, empowerment and sacrifice, from the perspective of women. Black women.\nBlack women are usually depicted and discussed as a collection of problems to be solved – be it discrimination, poverty or underrepresentation – so it was particularly beautiful to see these Black women the victors and very much their own solution. Fighting for each other and fighting for their people.\nThis splashy Hollywood movie is complete with the expected stunning performances from the icon that is Viola Davis and some well-known South African actors. So often large-scale movie depictions of Black history are about, and acted out by, Americans. But this Black History Month we are treated to Black British women Lashana Lynch, Sheila Atim and Shaina West shining just as bright in key roles. We also had a host of British actors in John Boyega, Jordan Bolger and Hero Fiennes Tiffin. This is something we can all be proud of.\n“It was particularly beautiful to see these Black women the victors and very much their own solution”\nFor a nation of our size, we have always punched well above our weight, largely due to the influence and wealth garnered from slavery and colonialism. The significance of British actors, who are the product of this, featuring so heavily in this particular film cannot be overlooked. It also says a lot about the talent of this under-represented group featuring so heavily in this blockbuster.\nThe film addresses a range of issues, from unity to ruthless ambition, and the rarely discussed fightback against the slave trade in Africa. Also, despite what some critics have said, it does depict African involvement in the slave trade. But even if it did not, so what? The movie doesn’t claim to be based on entirely factual events. It claims to be based on the Agojie, an all-female warrior group that did exist and did protect the former kingdom of Dahomey in West Africa. It never strays from that.\nTo me these criticisms display the level of misogynoir ever present in our society. For a film based on actual historical figures, that is openly fictional, it is sad to see responses that exclusively pick apart Black women’s heroism for negative historical context. The same criticism is rarely given to other films. It’s a shame anyone would see this film through that lens – and a sign that we need more films like it. So I hope many people get to see this film in all its greatness, and the parts that will make them laugh, cry – and definitely want to cheer.\nThis article was first published in Politics Home on the 18th October 2022.",

The Prime Minister has stated he intends to ‘turn the tide’ in twelve weeks, which makes it hard to justify such a long-term and excessive timescale for the powers he’s proposing.\n“I understand that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. To contain the spread of Covid-19, we must mobilise resources, strengthen our public services, and maintain safety and order. It also requires unprecedented state economic intervention.\n“But I’m deeply concerned about the Bill’s limited provisions for Government, not to mention some of its worrying implications. Its hasty passage through the Houses is compounded by the fact that many MPs and Peers (including me) have been forced into self-isolation.\n“I welcome the Government’s decision to accept the amendment giving communities the final say over religious burials. But the fact that this provision made it into the Bill in the first place shows how quickly drawn-up legislation tends to side-line the interests of marginalised social groups (who tend to be under-represented and overlooked in Parliament anyway).\n“We see this again with the Bill’s potentially devastating implications for disabled people and migrants. Far from taking the pragmatic option to suspend detention and deportations during a global pandemic, the Government has instead decided to extend the policing of migrants.\n“Emergency powers can often be sticky, especially without oversight, so I’m also worried that measures to close borders and detain people could end up enduring beyond the crisis.\n“Meanwhile, the Bill did nothing to assuage my concerns about protecting immigration detainees from the disease and ensuring migrants’ access to funds and treatment. Nor did it consider how migrants might be driven underground by an intensification of the Hostile Environment. This is a public health issue as well as a human tragedy.\n“Yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn also rightly highlighted the Bill’s worrying implications for disabled adults and children. An emergency shouldn’t be an excuse to remove disabled people’s hard-won rights. How can these measures really be in the interests of public safety when they’re going to make disabled members of the public less safe?”\nEnds\n- ‘Coronavirus: To protect most at risk we need a clear plan for social care, says Jeremy Corbyn’, The Mirror (24/03/2020) https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/coronavirus-protect-most-risk-need-21739415\nFor further information about this press release, please contact Ollie Collard, Communications Officer, Office of the Shadow Immigration Officer, Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP at oliver.collard@parliament.uk or on 07918110617.",

They were clear that a decade of austerity and public service cuts are culpable for the 800,000 increase in child poverty in working households since 2010.\nThey were also clear about the three most important things the Government can do to reduce the number of children falling into poverty in the UK\n- Removing the two-child limit and the benefit cap would lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.\n- Increasing child benefit would substantially reduce child poverty as well as providing support to all families with the extra costs children bring.\n- Maintaining the uplift to Universal Credit past the October cut-off and extending this to recipients of legacy benefits.\nSigning the No Child Left Behind campaign pledge\nI was also proud to add my signature to the No Child Left Behind campaign, which acknowledges the shocking impact on child poverty on children’s educational attainment:\nAs a member of Parliament, I pledge to do everything in my power so that no child is left behind in Streatham:\n- I call for the development of a cross-Government strategy to eradicate the poverty faced by the 4.3 million children currently growing up trapped in poverty.\n- I will use my vote and voice in Parliament to try to stop an expected 730,000 more children being plunged into poverty by 2024\n- We must value and invest in all our children, so they are supported to learn, succeed, and go on to have bright futures.\nYou can lend your support to the No Child Left Behind campaign by signing their petition too.",

Over the last decade, the team running the studio have turned this space into a real hub for local musicians, providing them with affordable recording and rehearsal spaces. I was therefore saddened to hear that their landlord is proposing an 136% rental increase when their lease expires in September. By the look of things, so are a lot of people living in our area, who wrote to me to express their concern over the announcement of its closure.\n|\n|\nThis week, I wrote to the Studios’ landlord, Lexadon Property Group urging them to rethink the rent rise, or, failing that, to extend the lease and give them time to find new premises. After a decade of giving so much to our local music community, this is the least they deserve. We should be really proud of the creative scene in our constituency and do all we can to protect it. I will continue to work closely with local venues, artists, and creatives to push for the support our live performing arts scenes needs to survive and thrive.\n|\n|\nA Vicious Cycle of Declining Educational Services\n|\n|\nThank you to my friend Florence Eshalomi MP for securing this week’s London school closure debate. I was very worried to see the recent closure of two schools serving young people in Lambeth: Archbishop Tenison’s and St Martin-in-the-Field High School for Girls. This is a consequence of more and more families being priced out of our city. I urged the Government to give London the powers we need to tackle the crisis of housing affordability which is at the heart of this.\n|\n|\nUnited for Nature Petition Hand-in\n|\n|\nOn Monday, I joined Zero Hour activists to hand in their United for Nature petition to Ten Downing Street. Climate breakdown is an existential threat, which demands urgent action to cut emissions. It also has devastating ramifications for our natural environment. In the UK alone, over 70 million birds have vanished in the last 50 years. On current trend, climate breakdown will leave 1 in 10 species extinct by the end of the century. The existing Environment Act only contains provisions to stop this decline. The Climate and Ecology Bill tabled by Caroline Lucas in 2020 (with my support) would set legally binding targets to reverse it. As the Government allows sewage to spew into our waterways, signs off new fossil fuel licenses and rips up environmental protections, it’s clear we have our work cut out.\n|\n|\nMarking Carers’ Week\n|\n|\nOn Carers Week, we reflect on unpaid carers’ indispensable contribution to our society and redouble our efforts to tackle the problems they face. Research from the Carers’ Trust this week revealed that 73% of the UK’s unpaid carers have not identified themselves as such. This means 19 million people are missing out on important information, support or advice that could make a real difference to their day-to-day lives. Charities involved with Carers Week are calling for greater cross-departmental action in support of carers, and a funded National Carers Strategy. It was great to meet with young carers in Parliament on Tuesday to thank them for all they do and hear about some of the challenges they face and make the Carers’ Trust pledge to fight for better recognition and support across government. The failure to fix the social care crisis places huge strains on unpaid carers in Streatham and across the country.\n|\n|\nSRTRC Meeting\n|\n|\nOn Monday, I took part in a parliamentary meeting with Show Racism the Red Card, appearin alongside former National Education Union General Secretary Kevin Courtenay, current National Education Union Secretary, Daniel Kebede, rugby star Luther Burrell and my colleagues Kim Johnson MP, Mary Foy MP, and Kate Osborne MP. We talked about the need to embed anti-racism teaching in our National Curriculum and teacher training. By equipping all our children with an honest understanding of history and the realities of racism in the present, we can prepare them for life in a more equal country that truly respects and values diversity.\n|\n|\nAccess to Cash: Brixton Barclays Closure\n|\nThis week, the three Lambeth MPs wrote to the CEO of Barclays UK over the planned closure of their Brixton branch. Many of my constituents rely on this branch, situated in the bustling heart of Brixton, and shutting it down would have a particularly negative impact on elderly and disabled people’s ability to access in-person banking services. I would like to see banks making a concerted effort to make themselves more accessible to these groups, not less – especially given the current economic situation.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

That was always the deal. But for most people in the UK, let alone London, the dream of homeownership has become precisely that: a dream. From 1971-2015, the cost of buying a house has increased by 43.6 times. If the average wage had risen in this way, it would be around £34.85 an hour. An average London home now costs 14 times the typical London household income. As scraping together a deposit becomes harder and harder, most of us living in London are paying someone else’s mortgage rather than our own.\nRenters were hit especially hard by the pandemic with those furloughed paying 100% of their rent whilst losing 20% of their income. Whilst workers were denounced as greedy for striking for inflation-matching pay rises, landlords continued to collect above-inflation rent increases. The cost of renting in London has soared by 31% since 2021 alone.\nAnd raising widespread issues of disrepair, damp, or mould in a rental property still raises the risk of a no-fault eviction. As renters buckle, the Tories have bottled it, kicking the can on their five-year-old promise to stop landlords using these unfair evictions to move people on. The worst thing about the ongoing delay is that dangling the prospect of a ban has only encouraged landlords to kick more people out of their homes while they can: almost 300 a week in London, with UK court proceedings up by 38% in a year.\nThe next Labour government has the opportunity to tackle this affordability crisis and offer renters genuine security by building a fairer regulatory system. This can begin with a no loopholes ban on no-fault evictions, which limits in-tenancy rent rises and provides proper funding for local authorities to act against rogue landlords exploiting our broken housing system. We should also heed calls from regional and local authorities for powers to freeze rents and levy taxes on empty homes to get these back into circulation.\nAbove all, we need to ensure that rental costs are not rising faster than pay packets. After both World Wars, governments of differing political persuasions recognised the need for this implemented rent controls. As we enter another period of economic insecurity after a crisis, we should imitate them and tip the scales back in tenants’ favour.\nThis article first appeared in the South London Press on the 19th of January 2024.",

Even as the Chancellor defended his murky tax arrangements, the Tories were delivering the biggest real terms cut to welfare in fifty years. And last week, the Prime Minister joined the Chancellor in the stocks as both were slapped with fixed penalty notices. But a £50 fine is a drop in the ocean when the 200 others fined for gatherings of more than 30 received £10,000 fines. It’s important that they’re fined the full amount but it’s even more important that they’re fired.\nIt’s no coincidence that last week’s Rwanda deportation deal came at a time when the Tories were under fire for Partygate, tax avoidance and forcing people into poverty. The Government’s plans to deport asylum seekers to camps in Rwanda are deranged. They are modelled on an Australian system which has been condemned by the UN for violating international laws against torture and killed twelve people – at a cost of £1.7m per person detained.

I’m working with Saleha Jaffer and St Martin’s Tenants and Residents Association to push for compensation.\nIn other housing news, I met with Wates, Lambeth Council’s repair contractors after longstanding complaints from residents on the Leigham Court Estate. I raised the chronic disrepair issues faced by residents, including damp problems, rotting windows, shoddy insulation, dangerous electrics, and one property whose ceiling is being held up with metal clamps. I also highlighted the company’s poor communication with constituents and contractors’ poor treatment of residents who just want to know when repairs are taking place.\nWates took over the contract from Mears in July, who left them a major backlog of cases. They have cited teething issues as a major reason for the continuation of this backlog but they are making a lot of money off these contracts. It was a productive meeting, with the company promising to address disrepair issues within Lambeth in the next four months, including for people on the Leigham Court Estate.\n|\n|\nOut on the Valley Road Estate with Councillor Marianna Masters\n|\nI was also glad to join Councillor Marianna Masters on the Valley Road Estate for a day of action repairing potholes, clearing gardens and fixing fences.

What have they got to hide? MPs should be able to properly scrutinise Government policy decisions with an eye on their potential impacts. We can’t talk about sexism, racism, ableism and poverty properly without talking about the economy.\nIncentives such as the super deduction are biggest for large firms and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury has admitted that only 1% of firms will benefit this year, as the rest are within the annual investment allowance. There is no justification for treating the rich and big businesses to mouth-watering tax giveaways and reliefs, despite unclear evidence about whether this will actually create the investment needed.\nThe pandemic has pried open the wounds of austerity, which never truly healed. This is one explanation behind the Government’s relentless recourse to dog-whistle politics and attempts to divide white working-class communities and ethnic minority working-class communities.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_streatham-mp-highlights-plight-of-migrant-care-workers/content_234.html": "Bell has written to the Home Secretary, highlighting the difficult situation faced by many migrant care workers and imploring the Government to grant them indefinite leave to remain.\nHighlighting the case of Anugwom Goodluck, a Brighton-based care worker who was told to leave the country during the early stages of the pandemic, Bell points out the uncertainty hovering over many of the UK’s migrant care workers (who currently comprise 17% of the social care workforce).\nAccording to Workforce Intelligence, there were 77,000 care worker vacancies in the UK as of October. With the sector grappling with rapid turnover and longstanding staff shortages, Bell has called on the Home Secretary to ensure care workers currently fighting the disease are able to stay in the country ahead of a likely second wave of infections.\nThe letter comes just weeks after the Government outlined its post-Brexit immigration plans, announcing a new “health and care visa”, which made no provision for care workers.\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour Member of Parliament for Streatham, said:\n“While the Government was failing to support UK care homes at the start of the pandemic, migrant care workers like Anugwom did their best to look after residents. Forcing them to leave the country is a shocking show of thanks.\n“It’s even harder to understand the Home Office’s refusal to grant these care workers indefinite leave to remain given the chronic staff shortages in the wider care sector and the likely rise in COVID-19 infections this winter.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n- ‘The state of the adult social care sector and workforce in England’, Workforce Intelligence (October 2019)\n- ‘Brexit: UK’s new fast-track immigration system to exclude care workers’, The Guardian (13 July 2020)\n- Text of letter below:\nDear Home Secretary,\nI write on behalf of my constituents, who are calling on you to ensure migrant care workers can remain in the UK and continue with their vital work in the UK’s vastly understaffed social care sector.\nWorking under incredibly difficult conditions, migrant care workers have been a vital part of the UK’s efforts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. It was therefore disappointing to see them excluded from the Government’s new “health and care” visa scheme. One in six of our care workers come from abroad, with many of them now facing uncertainty about their futures in this country.\nThe coronavirus crisis has thrown the situation in social care into stark relief. As you will be aware, the UK care sector faces a longstanding staffing shortage, currently estimated at around 122,000 (77,000 of which are care worker vacancies). It’s impossible to envisage a functioning social care sector that refuses to draw on the broadest possible pool of talent, less still one that fails to retain existing staff.\nThe case of 30-year-old Anugwom Izuchukwu Goodluck underscores the need for a drastic shift in policy. Working hard in a Brighton care home at the start of the crisis, Anugwom was told in March (at the start of the pandemic) that he needed to leave the UK, where all his family reside, and return to Nigeria. His new status left him unable to work and forced to move in with his mother. His case highlights the contradictory cruelty of the current situation. Sending care workers like Anugwom away makes no sense, given current staffing shortages and the likely second wave of coronavirus cases during flu season.\nI was pleased to hear your recent commitment to a more “fair, humane, compassionate and outward-looking Home Office”. As part of this, I hope you will consider offering indefinite leave to remain to care workers like Anugwom, who have propped up our devastated social care sector during the current crisis.\nYours sincerely,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour MP for Streatham\nFor further information about this press release, please contact Ollie Collard, Communications Officer, Office of Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP at oliver.collard@parliament.uk.",

Every passing commentator, newspaper reviewer or even Labour MP can throw a cabbage at the Labour leader while he is trapped in the political stocks.\nThis continues the hostility Corbyn has faced since becoming leader. This constant campaign of vilification was a huge factor in our defeat. If voters hear from the press that Labour’s leader is unacceptable for wanting to nationalise key industries, or raise the minimum wage, or even, ludicrously, that he is Czech spy, and then a chorus of Labour MPs reinforce that message, it is bound to have a negative impact. Voters mistrust divided parties.\nLabour could learn a few lessons from the Tories in this respect. Boris Johnson was clearly the darling of the Tory membership, but he was disliked and even distrusted by many of his fellow Tory MPs. Yet, when he became Tory leader only a tiny number of hold-outs opposed Boris Johnson. He dealt with some of them ruthlessly, even expelling former ministers “to encourage the others”.\nLabour does not have to go that far. By our nature we are a more democratic party than the Tories. But it should be clear that the demonization of Jeremy Corbyn was ultimately a rejection of the democratic choice of the Labour membership. It was not just Jeremy the man who was being attacked, but also the preferred choice as leader of the overwhelming majority of the Labour membership.\nThis article was first published on the Politics Home website on the 10th January 2020.",

As one candidate rightly asked in the early stages: “why should the public trust us? We haven’t exactly covered ourselves in glory”. It’s a question that not one of the contenders has managed to provide a credible answer to. After several weeks of taking lumps out of each other and highlighting their own dismal track record in Government, we’re down to a choice between two Johnson acolytes with the same failed ideas. With energy bills on course to rise to nearly £4,000 next January, our next Prime Minister shouldn’t be decided by a tiny minority of unrepresentative Tory members; it should be decided in a General Election.\n|\n|\n|\nParliament has now risen for Summer Recess and I won’t be back in the House of Commons again until September. I’ll still be taking the fight to the Tories over the summer, campaigning for action to address the poverty and financial precarity facing the country after twelve years of their policy choices. As ever, I’ll also be out and about in the constituency, talking to residents about the things that matter to them.\nMy newsletter will be taking a break over the summer but look out for my Recess Roundup ahead of the return to Parliament.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nI’m over the moon to report that I’ve been reselected as Labour’s parliamentary candidate for Streatham at the next general election, with unanimous support from all branches of Streatham Labour and local trade unions. Representing my home area as a Labour MP has been the honour of a lifetime. I’m excited to build on the work of the last two and a half years and help win the progressive Labour government we need to rebuild our country.\n|\n|\nStop Tory Bus Cuts\n|\n|\nI joined our Lambeth Labour councillors for a day of action to stop the Tory bus cuts and call on the Government to stop holding London’s public transport to ransom. The Tories have cut TfL’s funding by £600 million and has demanded they make service cuts and increase prices for funding to survive the Covid-19 pandemic. This now leaves TfL facing the prospect of having to cut 20% of London’s bus network, with several buses serving Streatham (45, 59 & 133) at risk being axed or changed.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nRemembering Streatham Labour activist Maxine James\n|\n|\nThe sudden passing of Streatham Labour’s Chair Maxine James this time last year was sorely felt by everyone in our local Party and the Black community as a whole. Maxine was a devoted local activist in our area for more than 20 years. Her family are fundraising for a bench in memory of Maxine on her beloved Streatham Common. Please give generously.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLocal School Visits\n|\n|\nI managed to fit in a couple more school visits ahead of their summer break, getting over to Burntwood School to talk about careers and my role as an MP and making it along to Holy Trinity Church of England Primary in Tulse Hill, my old primary school, for their summer fair.\n|\n|\nAddress Racism in the Cabinet Office\n|\n|\nIn my last parliamentary question before Summer Recess, I asked the Government about allegations of racism in the Cabinet Office and whether they will commit to the public inquiry demanded by PCS Union members who have faced discrimination and bullying in the department.\n|\n|\nTackling Food Poverty with Centrepoint UK\n|\n|\nI was glad to host Centrepoint UK in Parliament ahead of Recess to launch their latest report on youth food poverty and homelessness. They’re urging the Government to make a simple commitment to ensuring no young person has to choose between paying bills and having enough food to eat. In a wealthy country like the UK, nobody should be so financially precarious that they’re struggling to feed themselves or skipping meals.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPutting Race Front and Centre of the Covid Inquiry\n|\n|\nI recently co-ordinated a cross-party letter on behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations (FEMHO) urging the Government to include the unequal impact of the pandemic on minoritised communities in their Covid inquiry terms of reference and hear evidence from FEMHO. This was signed by 39 Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party MPs. I’m pleased that Downing Street has now accepted these recommendations. This month, I hosted FEMHO’s inaugural meeting in Parliament to discuss unequal health outcomes during the pandemic as well as legal aspects of the inquiry. Any meaningful Covid inquiry must put race front and centre.\n|\n|\nRestoring Stolen Artefacts to their Rightful Home\n|\n|\nThis month, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for African Reparations held its first evidence session on the question of restitution. The British Empire treated former colonies and colonial subjects as its personal property for centuries. Refusing to give back artefacts looted from former British colonies rests on the same racist logic. This evidence session offered a chance to hear from experts within the museums and heritage sector, who outlined some of the obstacles to repatriating objects looted under Empire like the Benin Bronzes. I’ll keep working with the APPG to push for restitution as part of a wider approach to reparatory justice.\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_march-with-midwives/content_562.html": "I joined midwives in our NHS to march on Parliament this month and highlight the emergency in UK maternity care. Most people in modern Britain owe our lives to a midwife but failures to address chronic staff shortages and invest in maternity services now leave them under incredible strain.\nMidwifery services are at breaking point, with shortages of more than 3,500 midwives across the UK. For every 30 midwives that train to enter the profession, 29 are leaving or never entering the workforce. 60% of midwives surveyed last year were considering quitting their jobs. Up to 30% of all mothers rate their birth as traumatic. This is an unacceptable level in a wealthy country like the UK and reflects the chronic under-resourcing of our health service.\nAs the Royal College of Midwives itself has stated: “Not a day goes by that we don’t hear of a maternity service having to close temporarily, suspend services or divert women to other maternity units just because there simply aren’t enough midwives. This can’t continue because we know it compromises safety and means women don’t always get the safe positive pregnancy and birth experience that they should.”\nA year on from last year’s ground-breaking demonstrations, nothing has changed. The Royal College of Midwives will ballot in Scotland, England, and Wales on industrial action this Autumn. Early indications suggesting there is a genuine appetite for a strike. It doesn’t need to be this way. All midwives want is the resources to do their job safely and provide care. It’s time for the Government to close the staffing gap and bring forward the necessary funding to give midwives, mothers and parents the level of care they all deserve.",

As at Napier Barracks during the pandemic, this led to an outbreak of illness among those held there and may well have been a contributing factor to the death of a 31-year old man this month. The Home Secretary has serious questions to answer about the likely illegal decision to block transfers from the site. She must also explain why official data records just one case of diphtheria there in recent months, despite over fifty cases being linked to the site. I’m relieved that the facility has now been emptied but it remains a death trap. The Government needs to close it down.\nThe situation when people leave asylum accommodation is scarcely any better. Some of my constituents held in local hotels are facing cramped conditions, bedbug infestations and unsafe food. During the debate, I asked the Government to review conditions at these sites, which the new Immigration Minister described to MPs as “luxurious”.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_black-history-matters-lets-recognise-that-this-month-and-every-month/content_366.html": "In our first ever Year 7 history class, my teacher, Mr Smart, told us to write down the following phrase: “We study the past to live the present with an eye on the future.” Why do we study history? Because if you don’t know where you come from, you don’t know where you are going. It is as simple as that. And when it comes to British history, we are not given a complete picture – because Black history is often missing.\nAccording to a survey by the Black Curriculum, 86% of people in the UK learnt about the Tudors at school but less than 10% learnt about the role of slavery in the British industrial revolution. Hence, Black History Month. To adapt the logic of the Black Lives Matter movement: Black History Month is the month when we say that Black history matters. We are not saying that only Black history matters. We know all history matters. We just need to recognise that Black history is British history.\nLike most people who have grown up in Britain over the past century, I never learnt Black British history in school in any meaningful way. Any learning I did do was during frequent visits to the Brixton library. The most popular narratives of Black figures in history remain focused on the US civil rights struggle and figures like Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks. These international perspectives are important, as Martin Luther King himself said: “An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere.” This is something we saw more clearly than ever with the death of George Floyd sparking global outcry.\nHowever, the UK has its own rich civil rights struggle and we need to make sure that British children learn about and understand this. On a personal level, it’s extremely damaging not to see yourself reflected in your own history. That is partly why I want children in our country to learn about figures like William Cuffay, Mary Seacole, C. L. R. James, Claudia Jones and Olive Morris.\nWe also know that history is always written by the victors. That is one obvious explanation for the status quo. The historical amnesia surrounding our country’s own civil rights struggles has a pretty blatant function in our political discourse: obscuring the past victories of the oppressed and marginalised to prevent a repeat. Very few students learn about events like the Bristol bus boycotts or the battle of Lewisham.\nDecolonising our curriculum is as much about class as it is race. In school, other notable gaps in my history lessons included the miners’ strikes, the poll tax riots, and the accomplishments of trade unions. The attempt to put Black history on the curriculum is the attempt to put the history of working-class struggles on the curriculum.\nI worry that there is an ideological reason behind the resistance to teaching the history of colonialism and working-class movements in schools. If working-class kids learn about movements for change and how they persevered to challenge injustice, what’s to stop them from recognising parallels with what’s going on in the present? Worse still, what is to stop them understanding their power as citizens and putting the lessons of the past into practice?\nWith the government actively trying to constrain the teaching of anti-capitalism and the equalities minister openly condemning the teaching of critical race theory in schools, this couldn’t be more important. The Tories’ recent tilt towards censorship tells us the same thing as their brittle rebuttals of the very concept of Black history in last week’s House of Commons debate: they are on the back foot with this.\nNo subject has received more signatories for parliamentary petitions than getting Black history taught as part of our national curriculum. As we saw when the statues started coming down, people will not wait forever for them to do the right thing. Another commission to ‘look into’ racial inequality, or platitudes about how much ‘better’ things are, are just not good enough. To quote Streatham native and rapper Santan Dave, “least racist is still racist” – and we need to challenge racism however and wherever we see it.\nBlack History Month is a means to an end. And that end is nothing less than giving everyone in the country a clearer picture of our collective past. That’s why Black history cannot be an afterthought tacked on to the end of a lesson or squeezed into one day, week or even month. Too much of the burden currently falls on the shoulders of busy teachers who have the impossible task of carving out extra time to teach it from an already full schedule. That is why the government should take a lead from our brilliant teachers and organisations like the Black Curriculum, the Coalition of Anti-Racist Educators and the Black Educators’ Alliance and include it in the curriculum.\nConfronting the history of slavery and empire is not about past recrimination. We need to address our shameful past and shameful present in order to look to a future of racial equality. Nobody is born racist but if we are going to end racism, we have to be willing to confront this to inform and inspire the next generation. Racism is ignorance, and what is education if not the absence of ignorance?\nA popular narrative about those who challenge racism and who highlight the wrongs of the past is that we do not love our country. But true love for your country is wanting to make it the best place in the world for all people to live, no matter the colour of their skin. If we are going to do this, we must teach Black history in schools this month and every month.\nThis article was first published in full on LabourList on 28th October, 2020: https://labourlist.org/2020/10/black-history-matters-lets-recognise-that-this-month-and-every-month/",

This week brought another screeching u-turn from the Government. It’s taken three weeks of economic carnage for them to back down on more of their disastrous unfunded tax cuts. So far, we’ve seen them drop their attempt to hand a huge tax cut to the top 1% of earners and, now, reverse their plans to cut the planned increase in corporation tax next April.\nThe Tories can change the Chancellor as many times as they want. But they can’t change the fact that their right-wing policies won’t help working people through the next 12 months, let alone reverse the damage of the last 12 years. Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked for announcing the policies Liz Truss told him to and promised to deliver in her leadership campaign. When your only option is to scapegoat your closest allies and u-turn on your key pledges one by one, it’s time for a General Election.\nThink tanks are predicting that even after reversing these tax giveaways, the rest of their handouts to the rich will put pressure on our new Chancellor to make £40 billion of new cuts when there is nothing left to cut. And the same tax giveaways have already forced a £65 billion bailout, pushed mortgage repayments up, and sent prices soaring. The damage is already done. If they had any integrity, they would apologise and resign.\n|\n|\nI was back in Parliament this week, where I voted to reverse the Tories’ hike to national insurance – a tax which disproportionately hit working people and which Labour opposed when it first came before the commons. I was also happy to vote through the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill, 24 years after this was promised in the Good Friday Agreement. Irish language speakers have been left waiting too long for legislation to protect their language rights. I’m glad this has now been rectified.\nI took part in Women and Equalities questions this week with a sub committee examining attitudes towards women and girls in educational settings.\nI also tabled two Early Day Motions (EDM) on migrants’ visa fees and settlement routes off the back of Migrant Voice’s detailed report on these policies, Destroying Hopes, Dreams, and Lives. With some visas charged at seven times Home Office administration costs, I tabled an EDM calling on the Home Office to reduce fees and scrap them entirely for children and young people.\nI tabled another calling on the Government to abolish their 10-year route to settlement, which pushes families into poverty, mental illness, exploitative work, and huge debts. They should replace this with a shorter route that reduces these unnecessary pressures.\n|\n|\nSupporting Local Food Banks\n|\n|\nAs the Government crashes the economy with tax giveaways targeted at the richest, local food banks are already seeing big increases in demand. I visited Brixton and Norwood food bank last weekend to raise awareness of the urgent need for food, clothing and sanitary product donations.\nThe number of emergency food parcels distributed by Lambeth food banks increased by 15% between April 2021 and March 2022. They’re expecting this to go higher, especially if the Government inflicts another real terms benefits cut on the thousands of families who need them in our area. As people struggle to feed their families, food banks are asking everyone who can to donate a couple of food items to the baskets in local supermarkets. And people who are struggling don’t just need food, they also need other everyday consumable; in particular: sanitary products, toiletries, warm blankets and clothes.\nUp and down Britain, food banks are stepping up to meet ever-increasing demand. But nobody should be left relying on emergency food parcels in one of the richest countries in the world, especially not when money is being handed out to the wealthiest with reckless abandon. That’s why I’m supporting the Right to Food campaign and pushing to make Lambeth a Right to Food Borough. Let’s campaign to put a legal responsibility for the government to end hunger and tackle its root cause: poverty.\n|\n|\nProtecting pay, jobs and conditions\n|\nPeople taking part in strike action are showing us one the most effective ways to combat the cost of living crisis. Across our economy, workers are getting organised and refusing to let employers pay for this crisis by slashing their wages and undermining their working conditions. I’m proud to stand with workers trying to protect jobs, pay and conditions during one of the worst squeezes on living standards in living memory.\n|\n|\nI started the week as I meant to go on, joining Lambeth College staff on the University and Colleges Union picket line before back into Parliament. With the Tories slashing further education funding, college staff pay has lagged behind inflation by 35% since 2009 with these cuts and other Tory reforms piling pressure on staff to do more and more. They are now coming together to ask for a fair pay rise, action on unmanageable workloads and an agreement on professional respect.\n|\n|\nI was proud to join Labour colleagues to stand in solidarity with striking Royal Mail workers on Thursday morning. Royal Mail made £758,000,000 last year and paid shareholders £400,000,000. With RPI inflation running at 12%, the company has imposed a 2% pay offer on them and has upped the stakes this week with threats to cut 10,000 jobs. If Royal Mail can’t operate without driving down workers’ pay and cutting jobs because their first priority is always paying shareholders, then that’s an argument to take the service back into public ownership where it belongs.\n|\n|\nIt was great to be on the picket line with UNISON members at City University on Thursday. These higher education workers are joining the wave of strike action to fight for real pay rises and call for action on workloads and stress. It’s also great to see them campaigning for fair pay grounding inequalities as they urge their institution to close ethnicity, gender and disability pay gaps.\n|\n|\nHigh Trees\n|\n|\nI was so happy to be back at High Trees this week for the grand reopening of their newly refurbished adult learning centre. The work to this building has been many years in the planning and wouldn’t have been possible without the faith and vision of those who have funded it.\nRooted in our community for more than 24 years, High Trees Community Development Trust helps people in our area to gain new qualifications, find job after unemployment and come together to set up local groups. In recent years, they had been held back by their buildings, which had increasingly fallen into disrepair. Their services had outgrown the site and significant renovation was needed. Over the 2022-23 year, they’re expecting to welcome more than 1,000 Lambeth residents to the centre. I’m so glad they now have a building which is suitable for the task.\n|\n|\nVisiting the Nehemiah Project\n|\n|\nLast Saturday, I visited The Nehemiah Project, an independent recovery charity which works with vulnerable adult men with a history of addiction, to celebrate Black History Month. Working with former rough sleepers and ex-prisoners, they run five residential houses where men can live for up to two years to address the root causes of their addiction. Black men are disproportionately represented among their numbers. I joined them for lunch and a fashion show where they showcased the t-shirts they recently designed.\n|\n|\nOpening the Streatham Festival\n|\n|\nIt was great to open the Streatham Festival last weekend with a launch party at Streatham Library and preview of the art trail which took place in shops all over Streatham this week.

During my time as an MP, hardly a year has passed without major water outages affecting our constituency, whilst the quantities of sewage unleashed into our waterways has only increased. Yet in this period, rather than ploughing money back into the system to fix these problems, water companies have given shareholders payout after payout.\nSewage leaks into our waterways because privatisation has enabled water companies to leak billions into shareholders’ pockets. As Thames Water teeters on the brink of financial collapse, the public cannot seriously be expected to pour more money down this drain. Equally, selling our water off to profit-greedy American corporations (the company’s current preference) would be a disaster: a recipe for higher bills and more sewage in our rivers, lakes and seas. We must take water back into public ownership to make it accountable to service users and ensure the money we spend on water is recycled back into the system we rely on.",

Slow to realise the threat posed by the virus, slow to acquire life-saving equipment, slow to take action to safeguard human life against the virus, their hesitation to follow the example of other countries and adopt bold policies during a public health emergency has left us all worse off. We will need to act with more urgency if we’re going to do better against an even bigger challenge: climate breakdown.\nFrom the Government’s response so far, you wouldn’t know we were facing a climate emergency. £3 billion of green spending barely touches the sides of the trouble we’re in. Compare this with Germany’s and France’s respective pledges of £36 billion and £13.5 billion or Denmark’s massive £33.5 billion investment in one major offshore wind project. The UK was the first to set a 2050 net-zero emissions target but with the Tories asleep at the helm, we’ll be the last to reach it.\nMeanwhile, the Government has provided loans to aviation, automotive and oil companies without setting out any binding commitments to reduce emissions, pay UK taxes or even keep workers on the payroll – as the disgraceful treatment of British Airways workers shows.\nThe case for a Green New Deal couldn’t be clearer: self-interested companies won’t put people before profit, so governments must be prepared to do it for them. This level of investment would deliver tangible improvements in people’s daily lives, creating millions of new green jobs during a time of rising unemployment, protecting the green spaces which have been a lifeline for many during lockdown, decarbonising our public transport infrastructure and bringing air pollution down to healthy levels.\nThe decisions we take now as we head into the next recession will determine the future health of our planet. The environment must be at the heart of our rebuilding efforts and that means every single government policy must fit with the bigger push towards net-zero. The pandemic has shown the importance of collective action and prioritising public health before private profit. We must learn from this to tackle the climate emergency.\nThis article first appeared as a column in the South London Press on Friday 24th July 2020.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_stuck-at-home-test-for-hiv-and-give-hiv-the-finger/content_319.html": "Ending new HIV transmissions is possible within the decade, but not without more action and real awareness of PrEP in the community.\nAs a woman of Ghanaian heritage, the impact of HIV/AIDS on the African community is not theoretical to me – it is very real. In the 1980s and 1990s, communities like mine – both in the UK, Africa and the Caribbean – were devastated by the virus’s impact, with many people losing family members and close friends. But the impact of the virus, while radically different, is not over.\nAs the Labour MP for Streatham, I represent a constituency at the epicentre of the UK HIV epidemic. Lambeth is a diverse community and better for it. It is where many people from African, Caribbean and LGBT+ communities have chosen to make their home and in doing so, make our area one of the best places to live. Both these groups are disproportionately affected by HIV. Lambeth is the borough with the highest number of people living with HIV. It is estimated that across Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham, there are about 1,000 people living undiagnosed with HIV. To put that into context, that’s about a sixth of all undiagnosed people in England.\nThere is an urgency to ending HIV here in south London, but that urgency is often lost nationally. HIV is no longer the death sentence it once was but this is not known widely enough – especially among Black Britons – nor are the massive advancements in medical treatment. Nowadays, people living with HIV and on effective treatment can live long, healthy and fulfilling lives. They cannot pass on the virus. Even more remarkably, this treatment stops the virus being passed on during pregnancy, so pregnant women living with HIV won’t pass on HIV to the next generation. Why are we not shouting this from the rafters?\nLet’s face it, it’s not the science that’s holding us back in the fight against HIV; it’s the stigma and misinformation that’s still associated with the virus. According to Public Health England, Black communities are still heavily impacted by HIV, with an estimated 28,200 Black African men and women living with HIV in the UK. In spite of this, five per cent of Black Africans living with HIV are still unaware they have the virus. It is time we all knew our HIV status.\nAlthough there has been a slight 3% increase in HIV testing within the community, Black Africans are most likely to leave a sexual health clinic without being offered a HIV test and still overwhelmingly affected by late diagnosis. The longer the virus goes undetected the greater the damage to your immune system. To tackle this, testing for HIV needs to become standard practice – every time we present at A&E, register for a GP or whenever the NHS takes a blood sample, a HIV test should be offered. But we can all get a free test, simple and easy to do at home.\nAs an MP, I know how important it is to practice what you preach. I recently tested for HIV as part of a screening programme for research on COVID-19. It was quick, easy and I got my results soon after. Normalising HIV testing really matters, especially in Lambeth, if we are to get down one of the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses every year, and the stubborn rate of late diagnosis – 35% in 2019.\nWhile most of us are stuck at home, testing for HIV is a great way to use that extra time. The test can be sent to your home, takes a few minutes to do and the results arrive by text or email within a few days.\nTesting for HIV is so important if you are living with HIV because it means you can access treatment straight away but it’s also important if you are not living with HIV. A negative result shouldn’t be the end point – there are now lots of ways to stay HIV negative. There is the relatively new anti-HIV drug PrEP (which is now free on the NHS), condoms and regular testing. While over five percent of those on the national PrEP Impact Trial live here in Lambeth, knowledge of the huge benefits of PrEP are largely unknown amongst the Black community. I want to see this information made available as standard after a HIV test. Everyone given a negative result should get the information to stay negative and that includes knowledge of PrEP.\nI want to see PrEP dispensed in community settings, not just sexual health clinics. Residents in Streatham, and across the country, should be able to get PrEP at their GP surgery, a local pharmacy and through their maternity services. By removing unnecessary barriers, we can help more people stay healthy and end new HIV transmissions – something which is possible within this decade.\nThe Government has committed to this target but we need real action, starting now. The HIV Commission, launched less than two months ago gives us a road map. No population should be left behind in efforts to end new cases of HIV, and it means not shying away from stamping out the structural racism and discrimination that fuels the significant health inequalities experienced by Black communities.\nWe’ve made huge progress since the early days of the HIV epidemic in the UK but the job isn’t finished yet. It’s something I’m determined to make happen on my watch as an MP. All of us have a part to play in ending the stigma and helping to stop new cases of HIV, and that starts with getting a HIV test.\nYou can order your free HIV self-test kit from Terrence Higgins Trust, available via the It Starts With Me website: startswithme.org.uk.",

I asked Boris Johnson if he would reverse the Tories’ 70% cuts to youth services over the last decade. He claimed his government has “invested in youth services”. If he sincerely believes £1 billion in cuts is investment, that explains a lot about the Tory levelling up agenda.\nWe are experiencing a knife crime epidemic in London, where we have lost as many as 50 people so far this year. A staggering 17 of them were young people including, tragically, 17-year-old Denardo Samuels-Brooks right here in Streatham last month.\nThe causes of crime are complex and manifold but it’s clear that poverty and deprivation are both key drivers. The pandemic has only added to the factors that have driven crime up over the last ten years: rising youth unemployment, youth services seeing income strangled by recession, and the mental duress of lockdown are all adding more pressure. I’m really concerned that we are going to see more and more people needlessly losing their lives and heightened violence on our streets with the summer approaching.\nThe most immediate things we need to look at include creating social outlets, improving mental health services and ensuring better job opportunities for young people.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_windrush-day-2021/content_275.html": "On Windrush Day, we celebrate the generation of migrants who came over from the Commonwealth after the war to help rebuild Britain. After the war, tens of thousands of men, women and children travelled from across the Commonwealth to make their home here. When we talk about the Windrush Generation, we think of the Caribbean, but people came from all across the Commonwealth, from countries including India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Hong Kong. They were nurses, doctors, railway workers, steelworkers, electricians, builders and farmworkers, and under the Nationality Act 1948, they were British citizens.\nThe 22nd of June marks the day when the Empire Windrush, carrying people from Kingston, Jamaica, landed at Tillbury Docks just outside of London. Lambeth has a particularly close relationship with the Windrush Generation as the first borough that many of these people settled in, spending their first night at Clapham South Deep Shelter, Brixton, visiting the local employment exchange in Brixton to find work, and eventually setting up home here.\nIt was lovely to spend some time with Corpus Christi College on Brixton Hill as they celebrated this local legacy with a very special musical Windrush Day celebration. At 10:27am, I joined them to sing Desmond Dekker’s famous song, ‘You Can Get It If You Really Want It’ to mark the 1027 passengers that arrived on the Empire Windrush 32 years ago today. I’m always impressed to see local schools making the extra effort to teach history in a way that reflects the full diversity of our country and community. I’ll continue to push the Government to follow their lead and ensure that Black history becomes a more integrated part of our curriculum.\nIt was also a privilege to join CARICOM Heads of Mission in Windrush Square at the Black Cultural Archives to pay a special tribute to the people who have done so much for our area. The Windrush Generation’s strong sense of community, faith and activism have helped make our area the incredible place it is to live today. Windrush Day is a time to celebrate their legacy but it is also a time to reflect on the injustices they faced and continue to face.\nThe compensation scheme is a scandal in itself\nThe Government’s compensation scheme has been criticised from all quarters for failing to get adequate financial restitution to the ageing victims of the Windrush Scandal. More than two years since the Government announced the scheme, the overwhelming majority of the scheme’s 2,367 applicants to date are still waiting for compensation. Earlier this year, the Government finally admitted that at least 21 people have died before hearing back on their application and at this rate, more will follow.\nThe current level of applications also suggests they have failed to reach many of the 11,500 people currently estimated to have been affected by the Windrush Scandal. And in spite of an overhaul to payouts, the average payment still does not seem adequate to the trauma endured by victims.\nLeaving the Windrush compensation scheme in the hands of the unreformed institution that caused the scandal in the first place clearly has not worked. The highest-ranking Black civil servant involved in the scheme quit last year, accusing the Home Office of perpetuating the same problems that created the Windrush Scandal. When the scheme puts the onus on victims to prove what they’re claiming, much as it did with their immigration status, it’s clear that lessons haven’t been learned.\nFollowing similar calls from community groups close to the scheme, Labour has this year called for the scheme to be taken out of the Home Office’s control.\nWe must never forget the Windrush Generation’s immense contribution to our society or how they stood strong in the face of the racism they faced under successive governments. Their struggles must spur us forwards to challenge the Tories’ divide and rule tactics and attempts to penalise migrants for the failings of their own rotten economic policies.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_visiting-local-asylum-accommodation/content_587.html": "I visited a local asylum accommodation to support the families currently resident there but was asked to leave shortly after my arrival. It is worrying that Home Office contractors continue to try and stop MPs scrutinising conditions and talking to constituents. This is becoming a bit of a theme. The same thing happened when I attempted to visit the other asylum accommodation in our constituency last year to check-in with families and help them access healthcare and education.\nAs the Government fails to address the backlog of asylum claims, people are being warehoused in increasingly dangerous conditions (as we saw at Manston) or stuck in hotels and hostels with very little regard for their health, dietary, cultural and personal needs. Meanwhile, the outsourcing companies responsible for these sites are making a mint. Whilst people live off £1 a day in miserable conditions and are denied refugee status by delays in the asylum system, directors of Clearsprings, the company responsible for asylum accommodation, were treated to eye watering dividends of almost £28 million last year.\nWe need to replace this inhumane profiteering with a system which enables people to rebuild their lives in safety. That means safe routes, faster claims processing, closing down death traps like Manston and Napier, and allowing people to work whilst claims are processed.",

The same MPs who threw tantrums at the prospect of having to wear masks in public and the same Government Ministers who have based entire policy agendas on a couple of their colleagues being disinvited from speaking at student societies, lined up to vote through a Bill which attempts to legislate the right to meaningful protest out of existence.\nNot a single Tory MP voted against a Bill that limits protest and is designed to target some of the UK’s most marginalised communities. But every single Tory MP has helped to mobilise a fierce opposition to their crackdown.\nWe already know that the Tories don’t really value civil liberties or free speech as ends in themselves; only in so far as they prop up their own interests. But their double standards on this represent an opportunity for us to expose them as the hypocrites they are.\nMake no mistake, the Policing Bill is an assault on all our civil liberties. But if it passes, its impact will be felt most harshly by minoritised communities. These are the very communities whose voices we should be listening to, not trying to silence.\nEven from a Government that brought in the Overseas Operations Bill and the CHIS Bill (better known as the Spy Cops Bill) – which effectively decriminalise acts of murder, rape and torture conducted by state agents including police and military personnel – this is a drastic attack on human rights, made all the more worrying by the wide application of its provisions: stricter sentences for defacing statues than the majority of rape offenders currently receive, new stop and search powers to use against protestors, making “serious annoyance” a convictable offence, criminalising trespass and introducing measures which expressly target Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities.\nAt the Police Crackdown Bill’s second reading this week, I tabled a reasoned amendment to throw it out altogether and force the Government to come back to the drawing board, citing the Bill’s blatant erosion of civil liberties and its disproportionate impact on the same minoritised communities in the UK who invariably have the most cause to protest in the first place. I was glad to receive cross-party support from the Greens, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the SDLP on this, as well as from Labour colleagues and comrades in the Socialist Campaign Group. With a Tory Government that enjoys a majority of 80, we need all the allies we can get to fight this Bill. Unfortunately, our reasoned amendment was not selected for debate by the Speaker.\nBut what’s going on outside Parliament is – as usual – far more important. Opposition to the Police Crackdown Bill has gone hand-in-hand with the protests we’ve seen over the past few days. People in my constituency were rightly outraged by the police’s forceful treatment of the women who came to pay their respects to Sarah Everard on Saturday. Chants of “let her speak” turned to “shame on you” as police kettled, wrestled and forcibly removed women attending the vigil, trampling all over the flowers laid by Clapham Common bandstand in tribute to Sarah. By cracking down on protest, they only fuelled further opposition.\nDecades of structural inequality fuelled this summer’s Black Lives Matter protests but the spark that ignited them was the Government’s shameful failure to protect Black communities from Covid and the persistence of disproportionate policing through the pandemic. There’s a similar dynamic going on now. Rather than working with the community to help put on a Covid-secure event – and despite every warning from the local community and despite every attempt at cooperation from the Reclaim the Streets organisers – the Police decided to pull the plug and behave in a way which undeniably put more people at risk.\nRather than cracking down on the genuine injustices raised by protesters – from gender-based violence to institutional racism and the climate emergency – this Government has shown time and again that they would rather crack down on the protestors themselves.\nBut protests this week have given the Tories a taste of what they can reasonably expect when they try to police and criminalise protest out of existence. Until they do something about the things that people are coming out onto the streets en masse to raise their voices about, the people are going to keep coming. By trying to police protest out of existence, the Government has only strengthened our resolve to defend it.\nThis post first appeared over at Labour Outlook on the 18th of March 2021.",

After a decade of giving so much to our local music community, this is the least they deserve. We should be really proud of the creative scene in our constituency and do all we can to protect it.\n|\n|\nSupporting Striking Cleaners\n|\n|\nOutsourced cleaning staff at Streatham and Clapham High School were striking on Tuesday and Thursday to ask for a fair pay rise and the same sick pay and annual leave entitlements as other school employees. Local newspaper South London Press has reported that some cleaners are struggling to afford the basics on their current salaries. Ahead of the strikes, I wrote to the school urging them to negotiate and meet what are entirely modest and reasonable demands. When the GDST Trust that owns the school turned a £27 million profit last year, there’s no excuse for them to be outsource their cleaners to the lowest bidder.\n|\n|\nSchool Visits\n|\n|\nIt was great to start the week with a school visit to meet City Heights Academy pupils alongside The Mayor of London. I got to see how they benefit from High Trees Community Development Trust’s mentoring scheme, which has been funded by City Hall. It’s vital that every child has this kind of support to help them navigate the challenges of growing up in our area.\n|\n|\nOn Friday, I visited Elm Court School to see their social enterprise project in action. They’re making flower pots from plastic bottles, taking a problem (plastic waste) and solving it by turning it into a product to sell. I put an order in for my new constituency office – in red of course! Great to see them thinking about how to tackle social issues and developing skills for life and work.\n|\n|\nPanel: Colonial Legacies in our Public Realm\n|\n|\nOn Tuesday, I was invited to participate in panel discussion at Brixton Tate Library exploring the legacies of colonialism in our public realm. It’s important to discuss who we honour in our public spaces: the people who were at the forefront of horrors like slavery and European colonialism, or those who fought to overcome them. We can’t change what happened in the past. We can reimagine our future. I hope we will also see other concrete social changes as a consequence of the discussion about reshaping our public spaces. I also hope national government will follow the example of local counterparts like Lambeth Council by acknowledging the horror of slavery and colonialism as part of efforts to tackle inequality and racism in the present.\n|\n|\nInternational Domestic Workers’ Day: Fighting Exploitation\n|\n|\nBehind closed doors in some of Britain’s wealthiest homes, domestic workers are trapped in some of the most abusive and exploitative conditions anywhere in the UK. Ahead of International Domestic Workers’ Day, it was great to host Kalayaan in Parliament this week, a charity which has provided advocacy and support services to these workers for over 35 years. We’ll keep fighting to amplify the workers calling out the abuse and exploitation they face and for the restoration of the rights they enjoyed under the last Labour Government.\n|\n|\nMeeting Colombian human rights defender\n|\n|\nOn Monday, I met with Darnelly Rodríguez, a Colombian human rights defender who works with political prisoners and documents violence against activists in the country. I heard about some of the work going on to build a fairer, more peaceful Colombia, and about the threats those involved in this have been receiving from armed groups. Colombia is still one of the most dangerous place in the world to be a trade unionist or an activist. This week’s peace agreement is a step forwards but there is more work to be done to ensure that right-wing paramilitaries aren’t left free to intimidate social activists.\n|\n|\nBlack Child Clean Air Conference\n|\n|\nOn Clean Air Day, I joined Global Black Maternal Health (GBMH) for the first annual Black Child’s Clean Air Conference. We know that Black people are more likely to live in areas with higher concentrations of air pollution. Our own borough of Lambeth has one of the largest Black populations anywhere in London and was also home to one of our city’s most polluted roads. It was great to hear about GBMH’s extensive report into the impact this is having on pregnant Black mothers and their babies. As well as taking the necessary action at scale to tackle outdoor air pollution, it was also good to discuss the need to increase awareness around the risks of indoor air pollution like damp and mould, household chemicals, and smoke exposure. Like the climate emergency at large, these things require a joined-up approach from across government departments.\n|\n|\nWe Are Not Robots: Meeting the Workers Taking on Amazon\n|\n|\nHundreds of Amazon workers walked out of a Coventry fulfilment centre earlier this year, in the first official Amazon strike in UK history. As they voted this week to continue their strike action for another six months, the company is throwing everything at them to try and stop them from unionising and winning the rights and pay they deserve. I was proud to show solidarity with them at this week’s GMB drop-in organised by my colleague Taiwo Owatemi MP. Amazon has been making huge profits by squeezing its workers and shirking its tax obligations for too long.\n|\n|\nGrenfell: Six Years On\n|\n|\nThis week marked anniversary of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, which led to the deaths of 72 people. Six years on, nobody has been held personally accountable, still less criminally liable for the negligence that led to these deaths. Meanwhile, across the country, people are still living in buildings that have fire safety defects or dangerous cladding, and don’t have decent sprinkler systems or fire. The Government needs to implement the full findings of the Grenfell Inquiry: personal emergency evacuation plans for disabled residents. More broadly, we need action to boost fire safety standards, end overcrowding in housing, reverse the disastrous cuts to the Fire Service, install sprinkler and fire safety systems and prosecute the companies and individuals behind this tragedy.\n|\n|\nA New Low in the Tory Attack on our Democratic Rights\n|\nThis week, the Government rammed through draconian anti-protest laws that were voted down by Parliament just weeks ago. The passage of the Public Order regulations via secondary legislation is the first time a government has reintroduced changes to the law previously rejected in primary legislation. Unlike primary legislation, secondary legislation cannot be amended, nor is it subjected to the line-by-line scrutiny or legislative back and forth between MPs and peers. Worse still is the substance of the law changes, which gives Police “near total discretion” over which protests to ban, according to one legal expert. The government shouldn’t be able to bypass elected MPs like this. Equally, it shouldn’t be up to senior police officers and government ministers to dictate whether people can exercise their democratic rights.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_spring-statement/content_281.html": "Ahead of the Spring Statement, I called on the Government to reverse the planned National Insurance hike. Research from the New Economics Foundation found that since the last election, disposable incomes have fallen by £110 for the poorest 50% and risen by £3,300 for the richest 5%. The National Insurance Hike is yet another regressive tax which will disproportionately hit the finances of all but the very richest households. A Government that cared about spreading the burden of the economic pain we are now feeling would be drawing up proposals for a wealth tax. But not this party of the rich.\nI also reiterated the call for a windfall tax on the excess profits of energy companies benefitting from the price hikes that are immiserating everyone else and for significant boosts to public sector pay, minimum wage, benefits and pensions, that keep pace with inflation as an absolute bare minimum. I wasn’t holding my breath for any of this but even so, the Government completely failed to offer support that matches the scale of the crisis we are now facing. The headline is that we are on course for the biggest decline in living standards in living memory.\nGovernment tax breaks will mostly benefit the wealthier half of society. Increasing NIC thresholds offers some help to those earning £9-£12.5k but the main beneficiaries are those earning £45k+ who will see back over £3k. According to IPPR analysis, the Spring Statement amounts to an average of just £120 in extra support for the poorest 20% of households, while the richest 20% gain an average of £480.\nIt cannot be stated often enough that real terms cuts to public sector pay, pensions and benefits will leave millions of people – key workers among them – confronting a cost of living crisis with even less money in their pockets. People on benefits could see living costs rise by 10% over the next financial year. Benefits are rising just 3.1%. Also buried in the small print of the Chancellor’s announcement was the fact that tax cuts announced will largely be shouldered by students as a result of Government changes on student loan repayments.\nA £330 saving for the average earner doesn’t come close to making up for the likely energy bill increases facing the average household by October this year, let alone the fact that pay is failing to keep pace with inflation. Cutting fuel duty isn’t about helping individual motorists either. A 5p cut means putting petrol prices are where they were just weeks ago. It’s just an excuse for the Government to look like they’re doing something instead of taxing the companies making record profits from sky high energy prices.\nIt’s hard to find words that do justice to the inadequacy of this month’s Spring Statement, which is condemning millions more households to suffer poverty. Nevertheless, the richest MP in Parliament, who just so happens be the Chancellor of the Exchequer, did send several very clear messages. Firstly, if you’re already struggling to make ends meet, you’re now on your own. Secondly, protecting profits is more important than protecting people. Finally like the last ten years, those with the narrowest shoulders will bear the biggest burden.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_tackling-food-insecurity-in-streatham/content_252.html": "As the Government tanks the economy, local food banks are already seeing big increases in demand. I visited Brixton and Norwood food bank in October to raise awareness of the urgent need for food, clothing and sanitary product donations.\nThe number of emergency food parcels distributed by Lambeth food banks increased by 15% between April 2021 and March 2022. They’re expecting this to go higher, especially if the Government inflicts another real terms benefits cut on the thousands of families who need them in our area.\nAs people struggle to feed their families, food banks are asking everyone who can to donate a couple of food items to the baskets in local supermarkets. People who are struggling don’t just need food, they also need other everyday consumables; in particular: sanitary products, toiletries, warm blankets and clothes",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_marching-for-ceasefire-in-gaza/content_175.html": "We are witnessing a cataclysmic eruption of violence in Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian territories. In the first month of the bombardment of Gaza, a Palestinian child died every ten minute. The conflict has claimed over 10,000 Palestinian lives, killed dozens of aid workers and journalists, and already resulted in the displacement of millions. In the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians have also been driven from their homes by armed settlers in an escalation of the illegal settlement expansions which have gone unchecked for decades.\nHundreds of thousands have marched in recent weeks to highlight this appalling situation. I spoke at two demonstrations, calling for a ceasefire. My message was clear: all attacks on civilians are wrong and innocent Palestinians must not be made to pay for Hamas acts of terror, which saw 1,400 Israeli civilians killed and 250 taken hostage. A ceasefire is the quickest path towards saving civilians, bringing home hostages, and moving towards a future built on equal rights and mutual coexistence. Britain has a unique responsibility to push for peace in the region. November marked the 106th anniversary of the disastrous Balfour Declaration, when the British Empire began supporting the mass displacement of Palestinians from their homes. As the country that paved the way for the Nakba, Britain has an enormous responsibility to push for a ceasefire and work towards a just and lasting peace. This feels further away than ever right now.\nMost of the 11,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza so far have been women and children. To put the scale of the current bombardment into perspective, Save the Children have reported that more Palestinian children were killed in the first three weeks of this conflict than were killed in the entirety of global conflicts last year. This month’s vote was about recognising our common humanity and taking a clear stand against the killing and collective punishment of innocent people.\nThe killing of civilians is always morally indefensible. To allow it to happen without any challenge is unforgiveable. Yet this is precisely what has happened, with civilians paying the ultimate price for the failures of US, UK and European political leaders to call for peace and call out violations of international law. It must also be restated that an enduring peace will not be achieved without addressing the root causes of the current violence. That means holding all parties responsible for violations of international law, recognising a Palestinian state and working towards a diplomatic solution based on mutual respect and equal rights for Israelis and Palestinians.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_slp-column-we-must-keep-pushing-for-answers-for-chris-kaba-family/content_140.html": "The fatal police shooting of Chris Kaba last week has sent shockwaves through a traumatised community. At 24 years old, Chris was studying for an architecture apprenticeship, engaged to be married and on the cusp of becoming a father.\nLast Monday night, he was shot and killed by a firearms officer following a police pursuit. We now know he was unarmed and that the car he was driving, which triggered the pursuit, was not registered to him.\nIt is right that there is a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances that led to Chris’s premature death. But these two facts alone raise difficult questions for the police, questions that Chris’s family will continue to ask.\nOther features of the authorities’ handling of this case have raised eyebrows too. It took a week for the IOPC to declare a homicide investigation and the Met a week to suspend the officer who fired the bullet.\nThese things only happened because of pressure from the family, the local community, and politicians. It is wrong that we are having to fight for baseline measures of accountability and basic information about the case.\nIt is right that we centre Chris’s family at this difficult time and listen to their requests for body cam footage and a timeline for the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation of the shooting.\nChris’s family are distraught. I cannot begin to imagine the pain and confusion they feel being left to bury a child killed by someone who was meant to be tasked with protecting them. Some closure and clarity is the least they deserve.\nConfidence in policing in London continues to reach new lows. Chris is the second black man to die during a police interaction in the space of three months and just one of the 1,883 people to die in police custody or after contact with the police since 1990.\nAlong with thousands of other people, I joined Chris’s family last weekend to march on Scotland Yard and demand answers. This show of solidarity reflects the fact that his killing was not an isolated incident; it is part of a bigger problem with institutional racism in the Met.\nIt is incumbent on the new leadership to offer the acknowledgement and action on this that has been so far lacking. But for now, it’s vital that we stand with Chris’s family. Other families have been left waiting decades for accountability and justice. They need our support and stamina for the path ahead.\nThis article was first published in the South London Press on the 18th October 2022.",

The Tories like to pretend the economic problems wer are facing are entirely global. In reality, the UK’s staggering economic decline is inseparable from Brexit, the last 12 years of Tory economic mismanagement and the last 12 weeks of Tory economic chaos.\nI had a chance to hold the Tories to account over the Autumn Statement last week, pointing out failures to level up and support the poorest in our society in particular. I focused on real cuts to benefits and the minimum wage, soaring housing costs for renters and mortgage holders and the elephant in the room: Brexit.\n|\n|\nBrexit has been a complete and utter disaster but this Statement didn’t contain a single mention of its disastrous impact. Whilst this Government continues to ignore the elephant in the room, we’re all paying the price: spiralling inflation, travel chaos, labour shortages, crops rotting in the fields, plummeting exports, a loss of work and opportunities due to visa restrictions, rising food prices, and the sharpest fall in living standards on record.\nRenters are seeing some of the steepest increases on record thanks to the Tories’ refusal to give our London mayor the power to cap rents and their delay in scrapping no fault evictions. Homeowners have seen their mortgage interest payments shoot up because of the economic damage wrought by the last Tory Government’s unfunded tax giveaways to the super rich. Whether you own or rent your home, the vast majority are worse off as a result of their policies.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n45 Bus Route Saved\n|\n|\nI’m pleased to report that our campaign to save the 45 bus has been successful! This will come as a massive relief to everyone who relies on the service. Losing this route to Tory cuts would have made it harder for our community to access affordable, sustainable transport. Thank you to everyone who campaigned for this alongside me to protect local bus routes and prevent these cuts.\nAt a time when we should be encouraging more people onto public transport. The Tories’ refusal to agree a fair funding deal for TfL after Covid decimated its finances, leaving our city facing the loss of 4 per cent of our bus network. Contrast this settlement with the no-strings bailouts dished out to failing privatised rail franchises. Talk about rewarding failure.\n|\n|\nEnd Unfair Tax Breaks and Loopholes\n|\n|\nThis week, Labour pushed the Government over two unfair tax breaks and loopholes that benefit a wealthy elite. We voted to close glaring loopholes in the Tories’ Windfall Tax, which currently lets oil and gas giants off the hook for as much as £17 billion. These companies’ rising profits are our rising energy prices. It’s wrong that the Government is leaving the burden on struggling households whilst fossil fuel companies are raking in staggering profits and getting great tax benefits.\nWe also pushed the Government to end charitable status for private schools, which would raise £1.7 billion every year to be pumped back into the state sector. Private schools aren’t charities. The funding gap between kids in state and private schools has doubled since 2010. Rishi Sunak’s impassioned defence of these unjustified tax breaks at PMQs whilst he attacked key workers for calling strikes show how out of touch the Tories are. They would sooner see state schools with overworked teachers, hungry pupils and crumbling buildings than end subsidies for private schools.\n|\n|\nAttending the Funeral of Chris Kaba\n|\n|\nI attended Chris Kaba’s funeral last weekend. On Monday the 5th September, the vehicle Chris was driving was brought to a forced stop by police on Kirkstall Gardens, a quiet residential road in the heart of our constituency, where he was shot in the head through the front windscreen. He was not a suspect and was followed in a police car without lights or sirens. The car he was driving, which led them to follow him, was not registered in his name.\nChris was studying to be an architect and looking forwards to becoming a father and getting married. It’s absolutely vital that the state learns lessons from Chris’s killing and starts to put them into practice. As Chris’s cousin Jefferson put it, his family’s struggle for justice is “not just for Chris, it’s for all the other brothers and cousins and uncles”. We continue to push for answers and accountability for what happened on that night.\n|\n|\nFighting for the Future of Higher Education\n|\n|\nIt was great to speak in support of one of the largest strikes in higher education history at this Wednesday’s packed-out University and Colleges Union rally. Maximum solidarity with university and college staff, who are not just fighting for pay, pensions, job security, but for the future of their sector. Theirs is a story that has become all too familiar in some of the most important jobs in our society.\nThe last two weeks have also seen nurses and ambulance workers add their voices to the ranks of workers taking strike action. Since 2010, paramedics’ real pay is down £5,600 whilst nurse pay is down by £4,300. These strikes are about low pay but they are also about its consequences: falling standards of patient safety, which is compromised by staffing shortages and under-resourcing. NHS workers have my full support and solidarity.\n|\n|\nHearing Evidence of Russian War Crimes in Ukraine\n|\n|\nI was at Olena Zelenska’s parliamentary address on Tuesday afternoon. The Ukrainian First Lady reported on damning evidence of Russian troops using sexual violence as a weapon of war and the perpetration of other war crimes in areas recaptured from Russian control. These are war crimes and must be treated as such.\n|\n|\nPushing for Safe Routes for People Seeking Sanctuary\n|\n|\nOn the 24th November last year, 31 people slowly froze to death in the Channel whilst British and French authorities argued over whose responsibility it was to save them. Last week, I joined their loved ones in writing to Rishi Sunak to call for the solutions to stop people being forced to make these dangerous journeys.\nAt a Select Committee appearance last week, the Home Secretary was asked how a teenage orphan from a warzone could seek asylum alongside family members living in the UK. She was unable to answer this question, because the Government has closed off safe routes for children in most of the world.\nAs well as safe routes and answers over the deaths of those who lost their lives last year, we need an end to poisonous rhetoric describing people as “illegal” or “invasions”, a timeline for publishing the inquiry into these deaths and quicker processing times for asylum applications.\n|\n|\nProtecting the Right to Protest\n|\n|\nI wrote for the Daily Mirror last week, setting out my concerns about the Public Order Bill. The Government is rolling back our civil liberties, without any care for the further the damage it will do to already marginalised voices in our society. Instead of trying to shut down important discussions, they should be safeguarding everyone’s right to stand up for what they believe in.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVisiting Asylum Accommodation (or trying to)\n|\n|\nLast week, I visited local asylum accommodation to support the local families currently resident there but was asked to leave shortly after my arrival. It is worrying that Home Office contractors continue to try and stop MPs scrutinising conditions and talking to constituents. This is becoming a bit of a theme. The same thing happened when I attempted to visit the other asylum accommodation in our constituency last year to check-in with families and help them access healthcare and education.\nAs the Government fails to address the backlog of asylum claims, people are being warehoused in increasingly dangerous conditions (as we saw at Manston) or stuck in hotels and hostels with very little regard for their health, dietary, cultural & personal needs. Meanwhile, the outsourcing companies responsible for these sites are making a mint. Whilst people live off £1 a day in miserable conditions and are denied refugee status by delays in the asylum system, directors of Clearsprings, the company responsible for asylum accommodation, were treated to eye watering dividends of almost £28 million last year.\nWe need to replace this inhumane profiteering with a system which enables people to rebuild their lives in safety. That means safe routes, faster claims processing, closing down death traps like Manston and Napier, and allowing people to work whilst claims are processed.\n|\n|\nJustice for Bhopal\n|\n|\n38 years ago this week, the world’s worst ever industrial accident took place in Bhopal, India, after a pesticide plant leaked highly toxic gas into the surrounding area. The Union Carbide disaster left tens of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands chronically ill and has poisoned the area for generations. This week, I joined my colleague Navendu Mishra MP to raise awareness of this tragedy and echo the voices of some of the poorest people in the world in their fight against one of the richest corporations.\n|\n|\nWorld AIDS Day\n|\n|\nWe have the tools to end UK HIV transmission in the next decade. What we need to achieve this goal is a laser focus on addressing unequal access and getting them to everyone who needs them. In a local context, one of our priorities has to be increasing awareness and access around PrEP. Local services need proper funding so they can engage with communities at risk of HIV and roll out routine HIV testing. And all schools need resources to deliver quality relationships and sex education that includes up-to-date information about HIV. I’m proud to represent a party that champions these things.\n|\n|\nOrchards Visit\n|\nOn Tuesday, I visited the head office of Orchards in Streatham Hill to find out more about their safe housing programmes for women who have experienced sexual exploitation. Established in 2019, they provide supported move-on housing to help women achieve a sustained exit through a holistic support plan that involves trauma counselling.\nThe lack of affordable housing is one of major reasons that women enter into sex work. It is also one of the biggest barriers to leaving sex work. Many women face the unenviable choice between selling sex to pay rent and falling into debt, a situation which is only getting worse with the rent crisis currently unfolding before our eyes. Orchards are currently receiving an uptick in enquiries and having to turn women away due to funding shortages.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

In response to Sarah’s disappearance, thousands of women planned to hold a peaceful, socially distanced vigil in Clapham Common Park to remember her and the thousands of women who have been victims of male violence.\nThe organisers of this event, Reclaim the Streets, had secured the support of Lambeth Council and local police to hold a COVID-secure event that would allow attendees to safely pay their respects. Unfortunately, just a day before the date, the Met Police decided to pull their support and Reclaim the Streets were forced to cancel the event, even though it was clear that hundreds of women would still attend.\nThis reflects a troubling situation where the Government has left police to arbitrate over whether or not protests should go ahead under the Coronavirus Act without explicitly giving them the power to put a blanket ban on protests during the pandemic.\nIn the wake of the tragic murder of Sarah Everard, I met with a number of local stakeholders, including Tulse Hill Women’s Forum, New Vision 4 Women and several local schools. I also addressed a London Labour-wide International Women’s Day event looking at the gendered impacts of the pandemic and discussed the impact of the Policing Bill.\nThe events of the past month have ignited a conversation about women’s safety and male violence against women. A recent YouGov survey found that 97% of women aged 18-24 have been sexually harassed and 80% of women of all ages have experienced sexual harassment in a public space.\nThese statistics are shocking, disgraceful and completely unacceptable. Women do not deserve to live in fear of their personal safety and urgent action must be taken to address the serious flaws in our society. This action must go beyond telling women to make “safer choices”, or wear “conservative clothing”.\nThe narrative must change. Male violence against women is not a female issue, it is a male issue, and it is the behaviours of men that must be addressed. The onus should not fall on women to change their behaviour to prevent becoming victims of an attack. Going forwards, I will push for solutions that address the deep social causes and political failings that allow gender-based violence to exist.\nIn the wake of such tragic event, I joined Church of the Holy Spirit Clapham for a service of prayer and protest to remember Sarah Everard and all the women we have lost to violence. Sarah’s murder has only strengthened the resolve of our community to tackle gender-based abuse and discrimination in all its forms.",

We must condemn and reject it as such.\nWhilst these rioters are a tiny minority, we cannot be complacent. We must acknowledge that fourteen years of austerity has created fertile ground for far-right propaganda. So too the ownership of our social media platforms and media outlets by unaccountable billionaires.\nMedia and political elites actively cultivate anti-migrant sentiment to divide and distract people. They seek to redirect justifiable anger around the housing crisis, crumbling public services and falling living standards towards migrants and away from the people in our society with wealth and power. These riots show where such racist and Islamophobic narratives can lead.\nIn Clapham and Brixton Hill, our community has a distinguished history of anti-racist and anti-fascist campaigning. We will stand united in the face of attempts to divide us through misinformation, hatred and violence.\nA national disgrace requires a national response.

I spoke in Parliament on this issue, where I pointed out that in our area, trust in policing is at an all-time low after the fatal shooting of Chris Kaba and murder of Sarah Everard. I asked the Government to ensure officers are properly vetted and automatically suspended when they come under investigation for crimes or misconduct.\nSadly, there appears to be a lingering inability to name the problems the Met faces. When the Government and Met leadership can’t bring themselves to say out loud that racism, misogyny, and homophobia are institutionalised in the Met, can we really be confident that they are committed to eliminating them? Many people in our area are also rightly asking why, instead of addressing abuses of existing police powers, the Government has been creating new unaccountable police powers which it openly admits will target racialised communities. I voted for the Lords amendments to protect the right to protest.\nRoot and branch reform won’t happen overnight but we need to see the Government and Met leadership taking the actions available to them today. That starts with more transparency, better democratic oversight, stronger vetting and zero tolerance towards officers who commit offences.

Nevertheless, the richest MP in Parliament, who happens to also be the Chancellor of the Exchequer, did send several very clear messages. Firstly, if you’re already struggling to make ends meet, you’re now on your own. Secondly, protecting profits is more important than protecting people. Finally, like the last ten years those with the narrowest shoulders will bear the biggest burden. The lack of support for the most vulnerable will condemn millions more to poverty.\nIn Parliament\nChild Q: Apologies Aren’t Enough\n|\n|\nThis week, I secured and led an Urgent Question asking the Government how they plan to address these issues and prevent these kind of abuses from happening again. There is no apology that could atone for the perverse and racist degradation of Child Q, only action to ensure no child has to endure what she went through again. The degrading strip search of Child Q is the latest in a long string of racist and misogynistic incidents within the Met. I was disappointed that the Government has chosen to delay justice by refusing to acknowledge institutional racism in policing, let alone spell out a plan to address it.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOpposing Anti-Refugee Legislation\n|\n|\nAt a protest against the Nationality and Borders Bill earlier this year\n|\nIt’s been genuinely heartening to see the outpouring of support and solidarity for Ukrainian refugees that followed Putin’s invasion. So it was even more heartbreaking to watch the Tories line up and vote through the most draconian features of a Bill which will criminalise people for seeking safety, including Ukrainian refugees. The Tories built a system which denies basic rights and respect to refugees then turned round and acted surprised when we failed to help people fleeing Ukraine. They know exactly what they’ve done by voting this through. They don’t even stand with Ukraine, let alone other refugees.\n|\n|\nPut the Right to Food in Law\n|\n|\nStanding with colleagues to support Right to Food legislation to stop people going hungry.\n|\nAhead of the Spring Statement, I joined my friend Ian Byrne MP and other Socialist Campaign Group colleagues to hand in his Right to Food letter to Ten Downing Street. The levels of food insecurity afflicting our country are a direct consequence of ten years of Tory policies which have created higher and higher levels of poverty, precarity and inequality. Just this week, food banks reported they were having to refuse potato donations because people cannot afford the energy to boil them. We should put the right to food in law and hold the Government accountable for this failure.\nDemanding a Better Deal for Workers\n|\n|\nStanding with RMT members fighting to save their jobs after P&O’s illegal mass sacking.\n|\nThis week, I stood with RMT members fighting back against P&O’s mass sacking of its workforce earlier this month. This came ahead of a Labour Opposition Day in which I voted to reinstate the 800 unjustly dismissed P&O workers, withdraw P&O’s government contracts, ban fire and rehire and strengthen workers’ rights. As usual, the Tories voted to let companies keep trampling workers to protect profits. The cost of living crisis has been made immeasurably worse by the erosion of workers’ rights and the fact that 40% of people have seen real terms pay cuts since the banks caused the last financial crash. We must demand a better deal for workers.\nKeep Telemedical Abortions\nGovernment plans to scrap telemedical care for early stage abortions are a massive roll back of women’s reproductive rights. Introducing these during the pandemic halved waiting times and reduced the risk of women being pushed into using illegal or unsafe methods to end their pregnancies.

As the Government continues to pretend that the institutions they are in charge of are not driving unequal outcomes across society, it’s more important than ever. I joined Stand Up to Racism to highlight how they are driving through policies which will make the racism faced by Black, Asian and ethnic minority communities worse, not better. I spoke out against the onslaught of racist policing which is the background behind the strip search of Child Q. I also reiterated my call on the Government to welcome all refugees, not just those it is politically advantageous for them to welcome, and to condemn the racism faced by African and Asian people fleeing Ukraine.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn the Constituency\nHappy Birthday Community Tech Aid\n|\n|\nPresenting Community Tech Aid with a well-deserved levelling up award last year.\n|\nIt’s hard to believe it’s already been two years since Community Tech Aid began collecting and delivering vital technology to people in Streatham.

Stage one of their consultation has identified several sites honouring figures associated with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. For the next stage of this process, they’re consulting on how we should reimagine these sites for the 21st century. It’s important to ensure that public spaces truly reflect the people who live here in the 21st century rather than honouring those who profited from slavery.\n|\n|\n|\nStreatham Memorial Garden\nTwo years after the first lockdown, work has started on a memorial garden to remember all those lost to Covid and the collective sacrifices our community made to keep each other safe.

The protest was part of a national day of action co-ordinated by campaign groups and trade unions including Keep Our NHS Public, We Own It and Doctors in Unite. Operose Health, a subsidiary of US-based Centene acquired London’s largest healthcare provider AT Medics in October last year, taking over 49 GP surgeries and more than 370,000 patients in the Greater London area. Twenty of these are in South London and include three Streatham GPs – the Edith Cavell Surgery, Streatham High Practice and Streatham Place Surgery.\nThe sell-off of Streatham GP surgeries is part of a bigger programme of stealth privatisation which the government has been pushing through during the pandemic. This takeover would be a real threat to accountability in particular. Our surgeries are never going to be safe in the hands of far-off US healthcare giants like Centene, whose need to make profit for shareholders will always trump the quality of patient care.

Budget 2021 was a missed opportunity to launch a green, equitable recovery to put people on a secure footing and address a decade of debilitating inequality.\nRather than addressing the structural weaknesses that allowed Covid-19 to run rampant through the UK, from overcrowded housing to chronically low sick pay, the Government chose to return to doing some of the same things that left us in such a weak position to start with. In my speech, I pointed out that the Government’s failure to recognise that the best economic solution was a public health solution has exacerbated the difficulties we are now facing.\nFrom a £25 billion tax giveaway to businesses like Amazon to another real-terms pay cuts for NHS workers and other public sector staff, it’s clear we are dealing with a Government whose first priority is helping the rich get richer. On the other hand, policy after policy will adversely impact the most disadvantaged in our society.\nThe word inequality appeared just once in this year’s budget.

Streatham’s schools have been hit hard by funding cuts with per pupil cuts of £688 from 2010-2019 with households seeing their income squeezed too. This means many of our pupils don’t have access to distance learning.\nIn particular, we’ve known for a long time that a functioning test and trace system was always going to be the cornerstone of a safe return for schools. Unfortunately, with teachers and school pupils in Streatham among those denied tests as schools returned this month, it’s clear this is not happening at the moment. With the testing fiasco causing ongoing disruption, the number of children learning from home has doubled in the last week alone.\nI’m delighted to have been able to work together with school management and teachers to get some of our most disadvantaged pupils the devices they need to carry on learning. But I’m also aware my efforts are a drop in the ocean given the sorry state of school funding in the UK and the impact of the current recession on household finances. As we head towards a second wave, the Government must leave no child behind and make sure every pupil has distance learning options.

Today, at Prime Minister’s Question Time, I asked Boris Johnson to put people before patents and join more than a hundred other countries in supporting an intellectual property waiver on vaccine patents.\nWhilst shareholders rake in enormous vaccine profits, they are now effectively holding life-saving vaccine blueprints hostage. There is also increasing evidence that pharmaceutical companies are charging low-income countries over the odds and profiteering.\nNot a single patent holder has volunteered to share technology through the WHO’s Covid Technology Access Pool (C-TAP). Meanwhile, Covid-19 vaccines were made possible almost entirely by public money and international scientific cooperation, including the 97% publicly funded Astra Zeneca vaccine – contrary to Boris Johnson’s bluster. Even more than the billions of pounds of government funding poured into Covid-19 research during the pandemic, it was decades of publicly funded research that laid the groundwork for these vaccines.\nVaccines were funded by all and they should be free to all. At a time when the world’s poorest countries have received just 0.3% of the world’s vaccine doses, we must do everything we can to protect lives and protect the world from new variants.

They took an axe to the aid budget but are still planning on pressing ahead with Trident at a cost of up to £205 billion. They are now spending billions upgrading our missile capabilities but claim we can’t afford to give nurses a meaningful pay rise. If there was ever a time to turn swords into ploughshares, it’s now.\nBut when it comes to nuclear weapons, the UK is part of a vocal and powerful minority. The UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons came into force earlier this year, banning their use under international law. It’s been signed by 122 countries so far, but not the UK.\nAs Hiroshima survivor and anti-nuclear campaigner Setsuko Thurlow said: “Nuclear weapons have always been immoral. Now they are also illegal.” But the Government has rejected this, claiming that signing it would damage our existing commitments to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and that a ‘step-by-step’ approach is instead required. As we’ve seen, this Government has rarely abided by the solemn and international treaties it has actually committed to. Their commitment to expand the UK’s nuclear stockpile by 40% flies in the face of article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which binds signatories to take effective measures “in good faith” towards nuclear disarmament.\nA legal opinion commissioned by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) found the decision to increase the nuclear arsenal is in violation of the NPT, ending three decades of gradual reductions and threatening world peace. On top of this, they refuse to announce a No First Strike policy, instead signalling a willingness to they will widen the scenario for a pre-emptive strike by reserving the right for the UK to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear threats.\nFinally, in another move typical of this government, they are now intending to stop giving public figures for the nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to scrutinise the expense involved in developing these weapons.\nThe UK Government are not just international outliers when it comes to nuclear weapons either, they’re also out of step with the UK public. Recent polling conducted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament showed a clear majority of support for a total global nuclear ban and the UK signing up to the NPT across every age, regional, national, educational, class and voting demographic surveyed.\nThe fixation with whether or not Jeremy Corbyn would press the red button when he was Labour leader ultimately reflects an elite preoccupation. There is nothing more deeply anti-democratic than the idea that one individual or a handful of people should hold sway over such a monumental decision as whether to initiate nuclear Armageddon. Reiterating your willingness to kill potentially millions of people is not political leadership. A grown-up conversation about the UK’s place in the world and the long-acknowledged obsolescence of our nuclear deterrent is long overdue.\nYou cannot build meaningful security on the promise of mass destruction. It is an affront to human life that at a time when we are facing the challenges of a global pandemic, rising global poverty and a climate catastrophe, the Tories pouring yet more money into destructive nuclear technology.\nIn the face of a Government that seems determined to ratchet up nuclear tensions, it’s more important than ever to learn the lessons of Hiroshima. Today, let’s recommit to peace, and challenging the dangerous and deeply anti-democratic evil of nuclear weapons in the UK and around the world.\nThis article was first published on Labour Outlook on the 6th August 2021.",

In a speech that used language redolent of Enoch Powell and gestured to the great replacement theory, the Home Secretary claimed suggested that women and LGBTQ+ people fearing persecution shouldn’t be able to seek sanctuary in the UK.\nShe knows full well that all over the world, many LGBTQ+ people still face persecution, imprisonment, and even death, simply for being who they are. 66 countries criminalise sex between two men or two women. 32 are in the Commonwealth. 12 states still execute people for being LGBTQ+.\nThe Tories’ disgusting and near-constant scapegoating of refugees aims to divide and distract voters from the ruin inflicted on the country during 13 years of misrule: the housing crisis, record NHS waiting lists, crumbling public services and plunging wages. The lower they sink in the polls, the lower they will stoop.\n|\n|\nTalking to Rush Common Residents\n|\n|\nIt was good to be out on the doorstep in Rush Common over the weekend talking to residents and raising awareness around the new Tory Voter ID laws. Enacted ahead of the most recent local elections, these laws are designed to make it harder for people to vote. They worked much as intended in this year’s local elections, stopping 14,000 people from casting their ballot. These voters were disproportionately young, working-class, and from ethnic minority backgrounds, as opponents of this legislation predicted. Older people were also among those more likely to be turned away. We need to build a movement to overcome barriers to participation, repeal this legislation, and ensure everyone can have their say. If democracy is going to work for everyone, it has to include everyone.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStreatham Common Fun Dog Show\n|\n|\nThe Streatham Common Fun Dog Show is one of the highlights of our local calendar, bringing dog-lovers from around the constituency together to celebrate our favourite canines.

Black mothers are three times likelier to experience postnatal depression yet far less likely to get support – another statistic that highlights the necessity to turn awareness into action. With growing awareness around these issues, we need the Government to set some clear and measurable targets to address them.\n|\n|\nOrgan Donation Awareness Week\n|\n|\nIt was great to be Windrush Square last weekend to mark organ awareness donation week celebrate Black organ donors and spread awareness of the need for more donors from ethnic minority donors. Overall consent rates were 40% for ethnic minority donors last year compared to 71% for White potential donors. There is a significant need for more organ donors of Black and Asian heritage to help the growing number of patients awaiting life-saving transplants. Blood and tissue matches are most likely to be found between people of the same ethnicity.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nVisiting the South London Islamic Centre\n|\n|\nLast weekend, mosques across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland invited in neighbours to share tea and refreshments, alongside an insight into the day-to-day goings on of a busy Muslim centre of worship. It was lovely to be with at the South London Islamic Centre as they opened their doors to the local community. Whilst the Government launches vile attacks on multiculturalism, communities like ours are building bridges and showing that our diversity is our greatest strength.\n|\n|\nKing’s College Hospital REACH Network Conference\n|\n|\nIt was wonderful to join staff from King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for their annual Race, Ethnicity, Culture and Heritage (REACH) Network Conference. The NHS is one of the most diverse employers in the UK, with nearly a quarter of the workforce coming from Black, Asian and ethnic minority background.

Taking into account the impact of inflation over the next fiscal year, that means every non-NHS public sector worker earning over £18,000 will actually get a real-terms pay cut.\nThe Government has also pushed back its manifesto commitment to raise teachers’ starting salaries to £30,000 back another year to 2023, despite the advice of its own education tsar.\nThe effective cut to teachers’ pay comes amid a looming recruitment and retention crisis in the profession, with one survey showing as many as 1 in 3 teachers are considering leaving in the next five years.\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour MP for Streatham said:\n“On Teacher Appreciation Week, I’d like to thank teachers and school staff in our area once again for their incredible effort and forbearance over the last year.\n“The Government has consistently failed to give our teachers the support they need during the pandemic. They are now making the already difficult task of getting education back on track even harder by expecting teachers to do more for less money.\n“After a decade of pay cuts and unpopular changes, it’s no surprise many teachers are weighing up their position in the wake of the pandemic.\n“It’s not just about the money either. A government that doesn’t value teachers, doesn’t value education or the opportunities it offers. The Tories have been devaluing teachers and devaluing education for too long.”\nEnds\nNotes:\n- Labour estimates, based on DfE data – School Workforce in England table tool – Headcount of all teachers – Total state-funded schools: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-tables/permalink/8f05674e-0226-49e6-b918-fba7e99e5d5f (see table for London region below)\n- The lowest teacher pay point is for unqualified teachers, with a minimum of £18,169. Therefore all 501,000 teachers in state-funded schools are expected to experience a freeze or below-inflation pay rise. Note that this only directly applies to Local Authority Maintained Schools, although in practice other state-funded schools such as academies are expected to follow national pay policy.\n- DfE – School teachers’ pay and conditions document 2020 and guidance on school teachers’ pay and conditions: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/920904/2020_STPCD_FINAL_230920.pdf\n- ‘One in three teachers plan to quit, says National Education Union survey’, The Guardian (8th April 2021)\n- ‘Accelerate’ £30k teacher starting salary pledge, says government’s recovery tsar’, Schools Week (22nd April 2021)\n- Photo attached of Bell during recent visits to Iqra Primary School and Holy Trinity Primary.\n| Constituency | Number of teachers affected |\n| Barking | 1707 |\n| Battersea | 569 |\n| Beckenham | 1043 |\n| Bermondsey and Old Southwark | 1301 |\n| Bethnal Green and Bow | 1633 |\n| Bexleyheath and Crayford | 936 |\n| Brent Central | 940 |\n| Brent North | 1743 |\n| Brentford and Isleworth | 1286 |\n| Bromley and Chislehurst | 942 |\n| Camberwell and Peckham | 1204 |\n| Carshalton and Wallington | 1379 |\n| Chelsea and Fulham | 729 |\n| Chingford and Woodford Green | 955 |\n| Chipping Barnet | 1328 |\n| Cities of London and Westminster | 646 |\n| Croydon Central | 1150 |\n| Croydon North | 1293 |\n| Croydon South | 959 |\n| Dagenham and Rainham | 1240 |\n| Dulwich and West Norwood | 1044 |\n| Ealing Central and Acton | 645 |\n| Ealing North | 1451 |\n| Ealing, Southall | 1026 |\n| East Ham | 1770 |\n| Edmonton | 1307 |\n| Eltham | 1126 |\n| Enfield North | 1525 |\n| Enfield, Southgate | 741 |\n| Erith and Thamesmead | 1035 |\n| Feltham and Heston | 1413 |\n| Finchley and Golders Green | 1230 |\n| Greenwich and Woolwich | 1002 |\n| Hackney North and Stoke Newington | 1164 |\n| Hackney South and Shoreditch | 1255 |\n| Hammersmith | 912 |\n| Hampstead and Kilburn | 811 |\n| Harrow East | 1044 |\n| Harrow West | 916 |\n| Hayes and Harlington | 1120 |\n| Hendon | 1411 |\n| Holborn and St Pancras | 1120 |\n| Hornchurch and Upminster | 1238 |\n| Hornsey and Wood Green | 1314 |\n| Ilford North | 1357 |\n| Ilford South | 1541 |\n| Islington North | 771 |\n| Islington South and Finsbury | 797 |\n| Kensington | 681 |\n| Kingston and Surbiton | 1065 |\n| Lewisham East | 881 |\n| Lewisham West and Penge | 877 |\n| Lewisham, Deptford | 954 |\n| Leyton and Wanstead | 829 |\n| Mitcham and Morden | 780 |\n| Old Bexley and Sidcup | 864 |\n| Orpington | 852 |\n| Poplar and Limehouse | 1559 |\n| Putney | 791 |\n| Richmond Park | 1091 |\n| Romford | 839 |\n| Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner | 1128 |\n| Streatham | 1073 |\n| Sutton and Cheam | 1022 |\n| Tooting | 1029 |\n| Tottenham | 1086 |\n| Twickenham | 1095 |\n| Uxbridge and South Ruislip | 1165 |\n| Vauxhall | 765 |\n| Walthamstow | 1242 |\n| West Ham | 2295 |\n| Westminster North | 929 |\n| Wimbledon | 918 |\nFor further information about this press release, please contact Ollie Collard, Communications Officer, Office of Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP at oliver.collard@parliament.uk.",

It was an honour to be invited to this launch event and I’m excited to see future work from the developers in the fight against ableism.\nI was also invited to Sense’s Parliamentary drop-in by Daniel, my deafblind consituent, to get a better understanding of these complex communication needs. People like Daniel face the double difficulty of hearing and sight loss but this should never mean that they’re left isolated as a result of this. Along with other members of the deafblind community, he taught me how to sign my name and even made me my very own Braille name badge.\nSense are doing amazing work to highlight the lack of social care funding for disabled people of working age. Accessible communication enables those with visual and/or hearing impairments to feel included and connected in the community.\nSuccessive Tory governments have made the lives of disabled individuals harder with every cut they’ve made to the benefits system, the NHS and social care. Shamefully, they knew these cuts would disproportionately affect people with disabilities and they went ahead anyway.\nA recent BBC Panorama investigation revealed that over the past four years, the DWP has paid out almost £1m to former disabled employees in discrimination cases. This exemplifies the total lack of care for disabled people at the heart of the Department under consecutive Conservative Ministers.\nIn recent years, I’ve met disabled people who’ve experienced this first-hand and have essentially been told it’s their fault if they feel marginalised. It’s vital to understand the systematic manner in which the burden of integration has been shifted onto the shoulders of disabled people over the last ten years.\nLabour’s 2019 manifesto flipped this idea on its head. It should be our collective responsibility to ensure everyone is empowered to participate fully and equally in society. That’s the outlook I will continue to defend as the Tories continue to kick the long-term social care plan they promised us further down the line.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_our-battle-over-the-police-crackdown-bill-was-never-going-to-be-won-in-parliament/content_202.html": "Conservative MPs, who cry murder every time a right-wing speaker is disinvited from an event by a student society, lined up this week behind a bill that tries to legislate protest out of meaningful existence. The untroubled passage of the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill (hereafter referred to as the Police Crackdown Bill) at its third reading makes it chillingly clear that rather than addressing the growing injustices of our time, the Tories are choosing to silence the people raising them. Clearly, it was never about free speech for them.\nThe Police Crackdown Bill is part of an authoritarian and anti-democratic agenda, which includes campus free speech enforcers, a Republican-style voter bill and attempts to curb the power of judicial review. Taken together, the legislation in this parliament clearly targets campaigners, unions, marginalised communities and anyone who might oppose this government. It’s about trying to centralise executive power and insulate the powerful from the discontent created by a decade of Tory misrule and the years of misrule ahead.\nWhen you crack down on everyone’s right to protest, it naturally has the biggest impact on those with the most to protest about. It’s no coincidence that this bill was proposed and published hot on the heels of last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.\nI joined Labour colleagues ahead of the vote on Monday to put down and vote for amendments and clauses highlighting the way that this bill will hit minoritised communities up and down the country, from Black, Asian and minority ethnic people to Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities.\nOur amendments sought to strip out: provisions ripping up the right to protest; discriminatory measures targeting Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities; and the expansion of the youth prison estate with secure 16-19 academies. We also tried to force the government to confront institutional violence and racism in the police and justice system. Sadly, they were dutifully voted down.\nLabour tabled an amendment to introduce minimum rape sentences, pointing out that the bill introduced harsher sentences for desecrating statues than the average rape sentence. The Tories voted against this, too. More evidence, if you needed it, that this bill was never about protecting people and certainly not women.\nThis battle was never going to be won in parliament. With a Conservative Party that enjoys an 83-seat majority, it’s clear we need to make the argument in the only terms the Tories understand: power. This bill is all about power. It’s about pitting people against the police, breaking the tradition of community policing, and putting pressure on the police to crack down on dissent.\nAs one former superintendent of protest policing pointed out: “Once a lower threshold for police intervention is provided in law, there will be an expectation, not least at the political level, for the police to exercise that power, which may lead to conflict”. The bill will make its way after the summer recess to the House of Lords, where many of the same arguments will no doubt be made.\nFrom the Battle of Ogreave to the scenes of police officers tackling mourning women to the ground in my constituency earlier this year (egged on by the Home Secretary), there is a long history of the Conservatives being closely involved with incidents of heavy-handed policing.\nThe right to peaceful assembly and protest have changed the course of history. The protests of today are the milestones of tomorrow’s progress. They are the reason that someone of my race, class and gender has the rights I have, and why I am able to represent the people of my local community in parliament.\nNo matter how much the Tories try to divide and demonise protesters, we only have to look at the treatment of the suffragettes to see that the movements vilified by those in power have been vindicated by history again and again.\nWe need to recognise that this authoritarianism fundamentally comes from a place of weakness, and ultimately, fear, and that hope is stronger than fear. It falls on us to stand together and build a movement that’s so big even this government can’t ignore it.\nI’m joining Drive 2 Survive, a coalition of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities to peacefully protest in Parliament Square today from 1pm. The fightback continues.\nThis article was first published in full on Labour List on the 7th July 2021.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_20th-may-newsletter/content_572.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n20th May 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThis week, we heard that there is an overwhelming likelihood that our overheating world will breach the 1.5C global warming threshold agreed at Paris in 2015 by 2027. This confirms what climate activists around the world have been arguing for a long time: that the promises made by wealthy countries with the power to tackle climate breakdown are not being met. When we have a Prime Minister whose swimming pool requires the local energy grid to be upgraded and who sees fit to take helicopters to make 1-hour train journeys, is this any surprise? The richest 1% are on course to emit 70x the emissions of the poorest 50% by 2030.\n|\n|\nThe carbon-intensive lifestyles of the super rich, with their super yachts, private jets and space travel, are fuelling climate breakdown. We cannot tackle the climate crisis without tackling inequality. Our green transition must be a just one, which leaves nobody behind and gives everyone a stake in the planet we’re working to protect. Instead of licencing new fossil fuels, the UK needs to show genuine leadership on the climate emergency. That means insulating millions of homes, ending domestic fossil fuel licenses, using our unique position to cancel debts for the global south, and cleaning up our energy system.\n|\n|\nAttending the Streatham Kite Festival\n|\n|\nIt was lovely to see so many people out in the sun on Streatham Common enjoying London’s premier kite festival last weekend. It was a fantastic day out for all the family with kite display teams, food and craft beer stalls, kite shops, a bouncy castle, trampolines, facepainting and other great activities. I would like to say a huge thank you to the fantastic Friends of Streatham Common volunteers who work so hard to make this such a soaring success every year for our community.\n|\n|\nTwo Long Overdue Reforms\n|\nThis week saw the publication of two important reforming pieces of legislation: the Renters’ Reform Bill and the Police Reform Bill. My colleague the Right Honourable Harriet Harman MP presented her Police Reform Bill to Parliament on Friday, proposing long overdue reforms to help remove officers involved in criminality and misconduct from the Met Police. The current procedures for disciplining and dismissing Met Police officers involved in misconduct and criminality are not fit for purpose. The Government must not stand in the way of efforts to improve London’s police by getting rid of some of the worst offenders.\nAfter almost four years, the Government has also finally published legislation to end Section 21 evictions. With average monthly rents in London have risen above £2,500 for the first time and the UK witnessing a 50% rise in homelessness last year because of no fault evictions, this is long overdue. However, without measures to cap rent increases and proper funding for local authorities to enforce legislation, renters still face being priced out of their homes through no fault of their own. Action will still be needed to truly protect renters from unfair hikes and give them the security they deserve.\n|\n|\nAppearing on LBC’s Cross Question\n|\n|\nI was invited onto LBC’s Cross Question with Iain Dale on Tuesday. In this format, panelists answer questions called in by members of the public. We discussed a range of issues: from Brexit to the cost-of-living crisis, Tory migration policies and this week’s unhinged National Conservatism Conference. You can watch the full segment above.\n|\n|\nSaving Babies’ Lives Progress Report\n|\n|\nOn Monday, I supported the launch of a very important joint report from two pregnancy and baby loss charities, Sands and Tommy’s entitled Saving Babies’ Lives Progress Report. This report pulls together data on the impact of pregnancy and baby loss across the UK for the first time, painting a concerning picture of stalled progress and a serious risk of regression. In England, the Government’s target to halve stillbirths and neonatal deaths by 2025 compared to 2010 levels is not on target. The report makes some vital recommendations to address this: targets to save babies’ lives in every UK nation, tackling staffing shortages in maternity services, more investment in research, improved data collection, and ensuring lessons are learned from baby deaths.We must keep working to ensure every mother and every baby receives the standard of care they deserve. Black babies are almost two times more likely to be stillborn. Stillbirths are nearly two times more common in the most deprived areas of the UK. As well as working to improve maternity care across the board, we need binding government targets to address persistent inequalities like these.\n|\n|\nAction for Race Equality: Windrush Justice Event\n|\n|\nAs we near the 75th anniversary of the first Windrush Generation arrivals in Britain, we must keep fighting for justice for Windrush Scandal survivors. So this week, I was proud to co-chair a packed out Action for Race Equality meeting alongside Dawn Butler, commemorating five years since the scandal broke. As one contributor said: “what has happened to the Windrush Generation is still being done”. Justice can begin with an independent compensation scheme, implementing Windrush Lessons Learned in full and an end to hostile environment policies which inflicted so much suffering.\n|\n|\nRainbow Honours Awards: Celebrating LGBTQIA+ Champions\n|\n|\nIt was lovely to attend this week’s Rainbow Honours Awards on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia alongside other MPs. It’s so important to celebrate the unsung heroes working year-round to stand up for LGBTQIA+ communities and fight for equality. Whilst we have made so much progress, young people from the LGBTQIA+ community are still more likely than heterosexual counterparts to self-harm or attempt suicide. We all have a responsibility to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia wherever we find it. I’m proud to stand with the entire LGBT+ community, today and every day in the ongoing fight for full equality for all.\n|\n|\n‘A Large and Liberal Atonement’: Discussing Reparations\n|\n|\nThis year marked the 200-year anniversary of a major speech by the MP for Weymouth, Thomas Fowell Buxton, who spoke in favour of abolition. He made it clear that freeing the slaves was the bare minimum of what Britain owed the people it profited from: “For all the blood spilt in African wars fomented by English capital […] we owe a large and liberal atonement”. Years later, whilst our prime ministers and members of the Monarchy have expressed “deep regrets” or “deep sorrow”, Britain has never officially apologised for its role in the Transatlantic slave trade. It was great to chair a discussion on reparations this week with panellists from academia, the Church of England, and the African reparations movement. We reflected on what Britain’s institutions, including the Crown, the Church, and the Government, can do to address its ongoing legacy.\n|\n|\nMeeting with The Traveller Movement\n|\n|\nI met with The Traveller Movement in Parliament last week to discuss how we can work together to challenge the structural racism and prejudice that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people face in healthcare, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. These communities are among the most persecuted groups in the world. The Government should be ensuring they have safe places to go and protecting them from hate crimes. Instead, they recently introduced legislation criminalising their way of life. Streatham has one of the largest populations of Roma people in London. We must keep standing up against racism in all its forms.\n|\n|\nMeeting with Thames Water\n|\n|\nI met with Thames Water last week to discuss some of the issues that have been repeatedly raised with me by local residents. Firstly, I expressed their frustration about the frequent works on Leigham Court Road and adjoining streets. Local residents have pointed out how digging up the road constantly has created an issue with potholes and I asked Thames Water how we could work together to deal with these. We also discussed how we can get more people onto the vulnerable people’s register, something they acknowledge is an issue when there are water outages. I also agreed to promote their WaterHelp scheme, which subsidises half the bill for households that earn below £21,749 or whose total bill is more than 5% of total household income.\n|\n|\nLast call for the Streatham BID Community Events Award Fund\n|\n|\nThe Streatham Business Improvement District Community Events Award Fund is open for applications. If you’re planning to hold a local event, you can apply for awards worth up to £5,000 now.

As a consequence of this, they don’t get full NHS sick pay or the same paid maternity leave as other hospital workers and even missed out on last year’s meagre 3% NHS pay rise. These predominantly black, brown and migrant workers taken over 50 days of strike action so far and made tribunal claims saying that this outsourcing amounts to indirect racial discrimination, with judgement on this imminent.\nGOSH hasn’t engaged with the security guards or UVW at all during this dispute. It was moving and inspiring to hear testimony from other trade unionists about how they launched similar actions and managed to win the same terms and conditions of their NHS counterparts.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_keep-covid-testing-and-keep-it-free/content_577.html": "I wrote to the Government urging them to rethink the short-sighted decision to wind down our Covid testing infrastructure. The PPE scramble and struggle to scale up testing capacity during the early phases of the pandemic stand as reminders of how cost-cutting and failures to put emergency systems in place can leave us both more vulnerable and paying way above the odds. But the true cost of such failures is counted in illness and lost lives. We can’t just close our eyes and pretend the pandemic is over.\nImmunity is waning, Covid rates are rising and people are struggling to get by. Cutting free testing means someone visiting a relative in care could end up paying around £73 a month just to keep their relative safe from Covid. In practice, it means many people will simply stop testing.\nWith the ever-present danger of new variants emerging, switching off our defence systems against Covid this early is complacent and short sighted. As the early stages of the pandemic showed all too clearly, failing to have the right systems in place may well end up costing us more than it saves. The Government should keep free PCR and lateral flow tests and keep our current testing infrastructure in place, as the overwhelming majority of public health leaders and scientists have advocated for.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_lets-seize-the-opportunity-to-create-a-circular-economy/content_30.html": "The recently announced Tory bonfire of green policies has further undermined our country’s commitment to a swift, green, just transition. They insist the plan is still to reach net zero by 2050. But setting targets is one thing; taking the action to meet them is another. As we diverge further and further from the path to net zero, we mustn’t let this bin fire of a government dictate our direction of travel.\nOne important policy in this regard is the UK’s proposed Deposit Return Scheme (DRS). The DRS model operates successfully across much of Europe, with consumers seeing a small redeemable charge on everyday packaging purchases such as plastic bottles, which are then easily redeemed through a bottle bank. Sadly, the half-hearted implementation attempts we’ve seen in the UK to date are another example of a government deprioritising environmental concerns.\nThe DRS is a model that has rapidly reduced litter levels across the 40 markets which operate it, including Denmark and Finland. Forbes reported in Lithuania return rates rose from 34% to 92% in less than two years after introducing a scheme in 2016. Meanwhile, the corresponding UK recycling figure is just 76% for glass bottles, according to British Glass.\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that such a highly effective policy might be quickly adopted here too. Yet despite assurances in 2018 from the then Environment Secretary Michael Gove, we’ve yet to see any concrete action from the Government, with ministers now suggesting a potential scheme won’t be introduced before October 2025.\nCreating a system that actively encourages consumers to return what they use is crucial to reducing litter across the UK, and ultimately our carbon footprint. These delays have thrown the prospect of creating a truly circular economy into serious doubt.\nMost alarmingly, the Government has acted against the overwhelming wishes of environmental campaigners, with their proposed DRS model in England and Northern Ireland set to exclude glass – yet include plastic and aluminium. This bizarre state of affairs would see just a fraction of the bottles and other packaging items we buy at the supermarket covered under the scheme, creating confusion for consumers and undermining the UK-wide effort to tackle the litter and pollution which blights so many of our high streets, countryside and beaches.\nThe UK Government’s exclusion of glass follows a series of flawed consultations by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which saw global businesses and environmentalists demonstrate overwhelming support for an all-in DRS, which would include glass alongside plastic and aluminium. This has widespread public support too, with figures from the Nature 2030 campaign group showing some 84 per cent of Brits support an all-in approach.\nUnfortunately, the problems don’t end there. The DRS models proposed by the devolved Scottish and Welsh governments advocate the inclusion of glass, with the UK Government’s out-of-step stance potentially creating a host of UK internal market barriers. It simply shouldn’t be the case that incentivising people to do the right thing for the environment should be a postcode lottery. We need clear and consistent policies that will benefit everyone across the country.\nThe continued dithering by DEFRA Secretary Therese Coffey presents a real opportunity for Labour to set the agenda. At minimal cost to the taxpayer, we can work to ensure we create a consistent DRS model across the UK, minimising consumer confusion, and maximising our environmental ambition.\nThe DRS stands out as an easily achievable policy, both administratively and financially. There’s no need for government-led subsidies or transition payments, nor is there any need for an overly long-term adjustment period. There’s no excuse not to start working on this from day one of a Labour government and it’s clear the environmental benefits will quickly follow.\nWe have the opportunity to get this policy right, with a manifesto commitment to introducing a consistent and comprehensive UK-wide DRS model, working with the Scottish government, and the Welsh Labour government who are leading the charge on this policy. We need a consistent, collaborative, and internationalist approach which puts the environment at the heart of everything we do.\nThe Government likes to pretend that the green agenda is costing us. What’s costing us is their inaction. It’s a national embarrassment that so many of our European neighbours are able to operate circular economies with ease, while UK ministers can’t even agree amongst themselves what a proposed DRS should look like. With a general election looming, Labour have the chance to create a truly circular economy. Let’s not waste it.",

This month, I had the opportunity to raise their concerns about Colombia human rights abuses in a Westminster Hall Debate, echoing their clear call for action from our Government.\nThis crackdown comes as Colombians took to the streets in massive numbers to oppose a neoliberal tax programme that would have seen low- and middle-income people shouldering the costs of Covid damage. The state response was brutal, with Human Rights Watch reporting that 63 protesters have now been killed, with thousands injured and dozens disappeared across the country. On top of this, there are reports of arbitrary arrests, sexual violence, serious injury and attacks on some of the civil society organisations trying to monitor the police response.\nI also met with Justice for Colombia in the run-up to this debate, an organisation working to promote solidarity between British and Irish trade unions and organisations in Colombia. Colombia has long been recognised as the most dangerous country in the world for trade unionists, accounting for 63.12% of the trade unionists murdered in the world between 2000 and 2010. A recent human rights commission to Colombia made up of delegates from 13 countries found that authorities were using counter-insurgency tactics honed in fighting the country’s leftist rebel groups against protesters.\nI reiterated St Gabriel’s students call for the UK Government to put pressure on Colombia to demilitarise its cities, review its training of Colombian Police, suspend the sale of riot control materials and review arms exports to Colombia. As pen holders for the Colombian peace process at the UN Security Council, our Government must challenge the current President’s attempts to roll back on the Peace Accord and push for meaningful reform of the Colombian security services.\nIf there’s an issue you think I should know about, local or international, please get in touch with my office.",

I’d like to wish a happy new year to everyone who’s keeping up with my work via newsletter. It may be a new year but we’re facing the same old problems. With the Government launching a fresh attack on workers’ rights as public services fall into deeper crisis, I’ve been back in Parliament this week holding their feet to the fire.\n|\n|\nAmbulance Strikes\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday, ambulance staff across our NHS walked out as part of the first paramedics’ strike action since the 1980s. I joined paramedics on the picket line at Waterloo Ambulance Station to show my support for these workers. After a decade of neglect, the situation in NHS emergency care is the worst it’s ever been. Ambulance workers deserve our full solidarity in their fight for the resources they need to save lives.\n|\n|\nAnti-Strike Legislation\n|\n|\nOn Tuesday, just 24 hours after inviting striking NHS workers in for peace talks, the Government declared war. Instead of negotiating with ambulance workers, nurses, junior doctors and other NHS workers considering strike action, the Tories are stripping away their basic rights. Anti-strike legislation returning next Monday would give the Tories carte blanche to mandate “minimum service levels”: sacking education, healthcare, public transport, and other key workers who exercise their fundamental right to withdraw their labour.\nWorkers should never have to strike to ask for the resources they need to do their jobs or protect the vital services we all rely on. The threat of sacking workers in shortage occupations like nursing and teaching make these plans arguably even more disruptive than strike action itself. I’ll oppose this legislation at every turn, which is attempting to crack down on workers highlighting the collapse of public services instead of rebuilding.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThe Future of our Postal Services\n|\n|\nThank you to my friend Tahir Ali MP for securing a debate on the future of our postal services and highlighting the decline in services that has gone hand in hand with cuts to services and efforts to drive down working conditions and pay. Last year, Royal Mail Group announced record-breaking profits of £758,000,000 for 2021 and promptly paid its shareholders £567,000,000. In the ensuing months, they announced swingeing job cuts, tried to row back on the commitment to a six-day postal service, and began to roll out new gig economy style contracts for their workforce. As I pointed out in the debate, this sort of mismanagement from Royal Mail leadership makes a very strong case for taking our mail back into public ownership – as the overwhelming majority of the public want.\n|\n|\nMake Cats Matter\n|\n|\nThis week in Parliament, I shared my constituent Olivia’s story of losing her beloved cat, D’Artagnan and expressed my support for her campaign to make it a legal requirement to stop and report collisions. 630 cats are hit on our roads every day, but they do not enjoy the same protections as other animals like dogs, horses, pigs, sheep, cattle and goats. Putting this change into law would mean that drivers who do hit cats are obliged to notify the police, increasing the likelihood of owners getting their beloved pets to the vet in time, or at the very least, providing them with some closure.\nThe Government has ruled out making this change on the basis that they are focusing on microchipping and making roads safer as their main policy response. There is cross-party consensus on these measures. However, the reality is that collisions are almost always going to be likely, particularly in major cities like ours where cars are ever present and cat ownership is high. This would be a small change that would make a big difference to the 27% of UK households that own cats. It’s one I will continue to pursue.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nProcurement Bill\n|\nThe Tories’ Procurement Bill had its Second Reading in the House of Commons on Monday. One in six government contracts won by businesses were awarded to companies in tax havens. The pandemic rightly put the procurement process under the spotlight as the Government scrabbled to get hold of the equipment it failed to stockpile and build the infrastructure to try and limit the spread of Covid. This resulted in a £10 billion overspend on PPE alone and a misfiring Test and Trace system that cost us around £29 billion.\nLabour is pushing for this legislation to include clawback clauses and outlaw the kind of preferential contracting that saw Tory donors awarded over £1.2 billion worth of PPE deals. Procurement should mean delivering high-quality services and driving up environmental and employment standards, not a race to the bottom that props up tax dodgers and rewards Tory cronies and donors.\nWith one in six companies receiving public money registered in tax havens, I’d like to see procurement cleaned up. The Government has a responsibility to promote better employment and environmental standards and ensure companies taking public money are putting it back into the UK Treasury and economy.\n|\n|\nJHCR Evidence Session on Asylum Support\n|\nI’m pleased to announce that I have joined the Joint Committee on Human Rights, where I’m hoping to hold the Government to account as they ramp up their attack on our democratic rights. This week, I participated in an evidence session on asylum support, asking experts and local government leaders questions around shoddy accommodation, inadequate legal and financial support and giving asylum seekers the right to work.\n|\n|\nVisiting Refugee Support Organisations in Calais\n|\n|\nOn Friday, I joined Jeremy Corbyn MP on a visit to Calais, where we met with some of the volunteers supporting refugees in the area.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_ground-rents-bill-in-my-view-south-london-press-column/content_263.html": "This week, the Government brought forward long-awaited legislation on leasehold reform. Whilst its Ground Rents Bill is in some ways a step forwards for future homeowners, it does nothing for current leaseholders or to address the exploitation inherent in this model of ownership. The leasehold scandal is particularly acute in London. Over the last decade, 71.9 per cent of all properties bought and sold in Streatham were leaseholds – higher even than the London average of 55 per cent. It’s no wonder that millions of people who have bought the leasehold on their home don’t really feel like they own it.\nLeaseholders face an array of issues under the current system, from escalating and often hidden ground rent charges, to extortionate and opaque service charges, limits on the right to manage and buy freeholds and, of course, demands from freeholders to cover the costs of the cladding scandal.\nGround rent is an outdated practice which forces some house buyers to pay thousands each year to companies that own the land their property is on, often for nothing in return. This Bill makes the welcome change of setting future ground rents to zero, allowing new long residential leases to charge just a peppercorn rent.\nBut on the whole, these changes will do little to reassure the 13,304 people in my constituency who have taken on leasehold properties since the Tories came to power in 2010. The refusal to extend this policy to existing leases effectively creates a two-tier system. If more desirable properties without ground rents enter the market, existing leaseholders – who still have to pay ground rents – will find it harder to sell their properties, potentially trapping them in undervalued leasehold tenancies with escalating ground rents.\nTo add insult to injury, many leaseholders are still being asked to shell out just to make sure they don’t burn in their homes with the Government failing to deliver on its promise to protect homeowners from the cost of the cladding scandal.\nThe timidness of Tory housing policy is inseparable from the fact that £1 in every £5 donated to the party comes from developers, the very people who would lose out if the scandal of escalating ground rents were truly ended, or if they had to actually cover the costs of their own dodgy designs. Wholesale reform is needed, but this Government of landlords, developers and property speculators is far too close to the people who caused this mess to take action to support the vast majority of homeowners in my constituency.\nThis article was first published in the South London Press on the 3rd December 2021.",

The docking of the HMT Empire Windrush on the June, 22 1948 ushered in an era during which tens of thousands of men, women, and children travelled from every corner of the Commonwealth to help rebuild Britain after the Second World War.\nOur area has always had a special place in Windrush history. Many of those who made this first crossing were initially housed in deep-level shelters beneath Clapham South Tube station. Many more settled in and around Brixton, the site of the nearest labour exchange. They went on to become nurses, doctors, railway workers, steel workers, electricians, builders, farm workers and with many staying to build lives in our community.\nAs well as celebrating the Windrush Generation’s shaping influence on our country this week, we must reflect on the injustices they faced and continue to face – from the appalling racism they encountered when they arrived here to the state-sanctioned suffering inflicted by the Windrush scandal. In 2012, the coalition Government brought in new legislation that introduced immigration checks into the NHS, banks, workplaces and schools the infamous ‘Hostile Environment’. The idea was to drive down the number of people coming to Britain illegally. The effect was to make life impossible for members of the Windrush Generation with every right to be here, without any discernible effect on migration figures.\nThe Windrush scandal should have been a turning point, with an estimated 11,500 people impacted. Yet five years since the scandal came to light, Windrush survivors are still waiting for compensation. The logic of the Hostile Environment still dictates our immigration system, and just this week, the Government has rowed back on more key commitments made in the wake of the scandal.\nWhat happened to the Windrush Generation is still being done and we must continue fighting for justice. It was wrong to put the Home Office that oversaw the scandal in charge of Windrush compensation without root and branch reform. The compensation scheme should be overhauled and made properly independent so that people are not denied the compensation they are entitled to. The recommendations made in Windrush Lessons Learned should be implemented in full. Above all, we must put an end to the cruel hostile environment policies which saw many Windrush survivors losing their rights, their jobs and their homes.\nOn this momentous anniversary, these reforms would be a fitting monument to a generation that has given so much.\nThis article was first published by the South London Press on the 23rd July 2023.",

The Tories know that they have overwhelmingly lost the support of the young, who fundamentally disagree with their reactionary and divisive policies.

Sadly, these warm words have not been matched by action.\nTheir Windrush Compensation Scheme has become a scandal in itself, criticised from all corners for its slow speed, complex documentation process and the high burden of proof it places on often elderly victims. Two years since it opened, less than a quarter of those who have applied for compensation have received any and less than 1% of the £500 million set aside for victims has been paid out.\nWorse still, they continue to learn the wider lessons of the Windrush Scandal, which saw people denied drivers’ licences, fired from jobs, frozen out of bank accounts, made homeless, and even deported in some cases.\nFar from working to ensure there can never be a repeat of this suffering, the Government’s treatment of EU citizens is all but ensuring one. Last summer’s Immigration Bill marked the second time in a decade that they have ripped up an entire group of people’s rights without care for the consequences.\nThe Home Office is no more known for its efficiency than it is for its compassion. The latest statistics on the EU Settlement Scheme show that with less than two months to go until the final deadline, there are still at least 320,000 EU citizens waiting to hear their fate, with over 40,000 in South London alone.\nAnd that’s just of the people who’ve been able to apply. One survey found that as many as one in seven EU employees were unaware they needed to regularise their status, with really worrying implications for the UK care sector and the 113,000 EU citizens working in it.\nBut if there’s one thing that sums up the continued cruelty of this Government’s immigration policy, it’s the plight of EU children in care. Thanks to the way the Government set up the Settlement scheme, the majority of these 3,700 children are not even registered for Settled Status, let alone on a pathway to citizenship. The Government is condemning these children to the same dismal experiences as the Windrush Generation.\nThere is a very easy way out of the mess that is the EU Settlement Scheme: automatic settled status for anyone resident in the UK as of December 2020 and giving children who grow up in the UK a lifelong right to register for citizenship for free.\nSadly, this Government’s attachment to hard-line immigration policies and driving down net migration means both these common-sense approaches are off the table. The fight continues for an immigration system that treats people as human beings no matter where they, or their parents, were born.\nThis article was first published in the 30th April 2021 print edition of the South London Press.",

Not a single Tory MP voted against it. Rather than addressing the growing injustices of our time, they are firmly united behind silencing the people who raise them.\nToday’s protests are the milestones of tomorrow’s progress. The Conservatives’ decision to ram through a Bill criminalising the act of protest and infringing the right to free assembly is an insult to everyone who wants to build a better future. During the pandemic, we saw the damaging effect of the decision to break up protests that the Government disagreed with and giving Police ill-defined powers to break up protest. This Bill will only make the scenes at the Clapham Common vigil for Sarah Everard more commonplace.\nIt is also clear that the provisions outlined in the Policing Bill will fall disproportionately on under-represented social groups. Indeed, some are even designed to. Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller communities recognised by the United Nations as among the most persecuted groups in the world.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_the-government-must-drop-its-devastating-disability-benefit-cuts/content_74.html": "In recent weeks, I have been contacted by hundreds of constituents, angry and anxious about the government’s plans to cut disability benefits.\nThese planned cuts would see millions denied Personal Independence Payments (PIPs), whilst Universal Credit top-ups are cut in real terms for new claimants and denied altogether to many young people.\nScope has called them the “biggest cuts to disability benefits on record” — a damning indictment considering the austerity inflicted on disabled people by the last Conservative government. Anyone who paid attention to the first round of cuts could tell you that these cuts will not do what the government is claiming. The OBR has been so far unable to produce any evidence that cutting the incomes of ill and disabled people will get more people into employment.\nQuite the opposite in fact. There is a mounting body of evidence that shows how hardship, anxiety around losing benefits and the threat of conditionality actually impede people from engaging with employment support in a way that gets them back into the workplace. The last government repeatedly suppressed a report it commissioned on benefits sanctions, which showed that they actually slowed people’s progress into work.\nOn the other hand, there is ample evidence that these cuts will be devastating for disabled people’s independence and incomes. At a time when bills are rising across the board, the DWP’s own analysis suggests that they will push 250,000 people in poverty by 2030 — including 50,000 children.\n1 in 5 families with a disabled member will be worse off as a result of these cuts. PIP is a gateway benefit, entitling family members to claim other benefits to support their loved ones. Half of the UK’s 1 million carer’s allowance claims, for instance, are tied to PIP, leaving many families face a double-whammy of cuts.\nThese cuts are likely to leave people poorer and sicker, leaving more people reliant on NHS and social care services. When families can no longer afford to care for their loved ones, this is likely to drive more people into the formal care system too. Far from creating “savings”, these cuts merely shift costs from central government onto households and local authorities, who are less equipped to cope with them.\nSome of the government’s reforms are welcome. The rollout of a ‘Right to Try’ guarantee would mean people who accept a job offer are not subjected to automatic re-assessment if their job doesn’t work out. This is a compassionate and pragmatic policy which removes a big disincentive for people to re-enter the workforce. Sadly, it will be totally undermined by the sheer scale of these cuts.\nYes, the number of people who are claiming sickness and disability benefits is rising. It is worrying that this seems to come as such a surprise to some. We live in a country with an ageing population where health services were starved of investment for a decade. There are many people on NHS waiting lists who would much rather be healthy enough to return to work.\nMental health provision remains inadequate. Every week, I hear from constituents affected by mental health issues. There are well-established correlations between the mental ill health we experience as a society and the normalised austerity, low-quality work, entrenched inequality, crumbling public services, unaffordable housing and escalating living costs that characterise life in mid-2020s Britain.\nRising claims are rooted in the social realities of demographic ageing and economic decline. We need solutions that get to the root of these issues. Putting our heads in the sand and cutting support to those worst-affected by them will only make these problems worse, costing us more in the long run.\nContinuing the Tories’ disgraceful legacy on benefits is not the change this government was elected to enact. This is increasingly borne out in dismal polling but there is still time to change course.\nThe Labour Party created the welfare state as we know it. We should be embracing this legacy. Because the truth is that any one of us may need to fall back on our social security system at any point in our lives. When that happens, we need a well-funded safety net in place.\nIf the safety net is cut, don’t be surprised when more people fall through it. My biggest fear of all is that we may ultimately count the cost of cuts in lost lives. One study attributed 330,000 excess deaths in Britain between 2012-2019 to the last round of austerity and cuts.\nWe need a new approach focused on supporting people back into work that centres more support, better jobs and investment in our NHS. To fund this, the government should follow the money. Whilst disabled people bore the brunt of vicious cuts under the last government, UK billionaires’ wealth more than trebled. Taxing the rich comes with its own challenges. However, these are challenges the government must rise to if it is going to reverse our country’s trajectory of decline. You do not cut your way to growth.\nThese cuts would be the worst of all worlds. I remain resolutely opposed and will be voting against them if they come to pass. But it is not too late for the government to think again. I urge them to do so.\nThis article was first published on politics.co.uk on the 4th April 2025.",

My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and family of Denardo Samuels-Brooks, the teenager fatally stabbed in Prentis Road. My thanks go to local emergency workers who dealt with the incident and the support services who are dealing with the aftermath. We cannot underestimate the trauma that knife crime inflicts on entire communities.\nIn the wake of the tragedy, I was chosen for a Prime Minister’s Question and called on Boris Johnson to\nreverse his party’s 70 per cent cuts to youth budgets over the last decade. His response was a flat-out denial, claiming that his party had “invested in youth services”. If he genuinely believes that £1 billion of cuts is investment, I fear for our country.\nIn the same month, we had Tory MPs claiming that working class kids are being held back by schools teaching them about racism. This from a party that has closed more than 750 youth centres over the last decade, trebled tuition fees, cut school funding by nine per cent and abolished Educational Maintenance Allowance.\nInstead of trying to create divisions within working-class communities to distract from these failings, wouldn’t it be more helpful if they just released the £500 million they pledged for youth services ahead of the last general election?\nIt’s important to acknowledge that knife crime is driven by a series of complex factors, many of which have deprivation and poverty at their root. We’ve seen a 50 per cent increase in knife crime since 2010, rising in step with austerity: youth funding cuts, the growth in zero-hours jobs, and police cuts.\nThe worrying violence we have seen so far this summer reflects a situation where the impact of the pandemic has fallen hardest on disadvantaged families in our area, increasing deprivation and stifling new job opportunities.\nThe most immediate things we need to look at include creating social outlets, improving mental health services and ensuring better job opportunities for young people. We also need to create a stronger culture of community policing, where policing is something that is done with people, not to them.\nBut we also need to acknowledge that the problems run deeper. In my experience, knife crime is impacted by everything from housing policy to employment and education. I welcome Lambeth Council’s Lambeth Made Safer strategy, headed up by Councillor Jacqui Dyer, which builds on successful strategies from elsewhere in the UK, to make our borough safer for young people. By resourcing local governments properly and adopting a holistic public health approach to violence, we can work effectively with the local community to make harm reduction the number one focus.\nThis article was first published in the 9th July edition of the South London Press and on the 13th July on the website.",

The week schools returned saw a particular influx of emails from people who were showing symptoms and either struggling to access testing or being sent to unfeasibly distant test centres.\nShockingly, and despite reassurances to the contrary from the government, local key workers are clearly no exception to these issues with teachers and doctors among those reporting they cannot access testing. When testing is stretched so thin that it’s stopping our public servants doing their vital work, it’s clear something is deeply and fundamentally wrong.\nObserving the rollout of the Government’s outsourced test and trace system over the past few months has been like witnessing a slow car crash. After months of Ministers promising us a working NHS test and trace system, what we got was an outsourced mess cobbled together by corner-cutting private companies, some of them with suspiciously close Government ties. Predictably, this buckled precisely at the moment we most needed it – when schools returned. If the people in charge of test and trace couldn’t have foreseen this increase in demand, they’re clearly not qualified to be running it.\nThe crisis in testing is symptomatic of wider government failures to provide people with the policies they need to stay safe during the pandemic. As with public health, so with the economy. As we head into winter, people around the country are really struggling. The chancellor’s most recent statement failed to tackle the UK’s low sick pay, failed to offer extra support for the three million excluded from income support so far and failed to fix the broken Universal Credit system.\nThe lesson of the pandemic is that nobody’s safe until everyone is. We must continue to oppose the Government’s reckless attempt to parcel up NHS services to for-profit advisers.

Since so much school funding is provided on a per pupil basis, fewer pupils means a smaller pot. Coupled with swingeing cuts, this places serious pressure on local authorities and councils to cut provision.\nMany schools in London are facing closure after 14 years of cuts to council budgets. Local Schools in Clapham & Brixton Hill have seen real terms funding cuts of £1,165 per pupil since 2010/11 according to the Stop School Cuts campaign.\nI support Lambeth NEU members in their efforts to protect local school provision, which has been built up over years. As an MP for the local area, I’m very concerned that closures will see us losing valued staff in the middle of a wider retention and recruitment crisis in the teaching profession.\nIt’s great to see NEU members making the case for protecting local education provision and transitioning to smaller class sizes. This must be the ultimate aim of a Labour government that has stated its commitment to delivering excellence for everyone. Schools must be financially viable with smaller class numbers.\nThe current situation only underscores the urgent need for our new government to find a way to boost investment in schools and teachers.

It’s not people fleeing desperation who are the problem here; it’s politicians peddling misinformation and proffering easy scapegoats.\nThe decision to take this hostile line towards migrants isn’t solely discursive either.\nWhether it’s sending Naval ships to chase dinghies, stripping back refugee children’s rights or effectively slamming the door in the face of migrant key workers, this government has shown us time and again that it’s always willing to go one step further to seem tough on immigration.\nTheir treatment of migrants is inseparable from their plan to drive private profits up in post-Brexit Britain, even if that means driving terms and conditions for workers down.\nContrary to the belief of some decrying those crossing over from France, these people did not appear out of thin air and refugees are not obligated to claim asylum in the first safe country they land in.\nUnder the Refugee Convention, we have an obligation to help those seeking safety. Rather than trying to push refugees and asylum seekers back onto continental Europe (whether by clumsy Brexit diplomacy or Naval war ship), the Government must accept its international obligations and accept our fair share of refugees.\nWe often hear that Britain is one of the most welcoming and least racist countries in the world. To quote Streatham’s own Santan Dave, “least racist is still racist”.\nAnd you’d find it hard to argue Britain’s generosity to asylum seekers based on Home Office asylum data. We’re below the European average for asylum applications, with countries like Germany, France, Spain and Greece all seeing between two and four times as many as the UK.\nWe must also remember that the number of refugees settling in Europe is a widow’s mite compared to the 85% of all refugees living in developing countries. This week alone, the UN reported that 55 people drowned off the coast of North Africa.\nThe main thing separating us from those in dinghies is luck. As Tony Benn pointed out, “the way a government treats asylum seekers is very instructive because it shows you how they would treat the rest of us if they thought they could get away with it”.\nWe’re living through an age of mass displacement, driven by war, poverty and climate breakdown.\nA comparatively large, wealthy European country like Britain should be leading the way, not trying to pass the buck to somebody else. During the Second World War, we rightly accepted thousands of German Jewish child refugees through the Kindertransport scheme.

Just this year, a mother-of-three was jailed for 28 months after terminating her pregnancy. While this sentence was rightly overturned, it is a reminder that women can still be prosecuted. We have also recently heard that the police are testing women for abortion drugs and requesting data from menstrual tracking apps after unexplained pregnancy losses. It is completely wrong that women are being investigated, prosecuted and imprisoned under Victorian-era legislation for ending their pregnancies.

Solidarity with the people of Ukraine and all those who have sought refuge in our country. It has been genuinely inspiring to witness people opening their hearts and homes to Ukrainian refugees. This week also brought news that thousands of Afghan refugees have been forced to cross the Channel in boats because the Government only resettled 22 people last year. The baseline of support that has been provided to refugees from Ukraine should be the floor, not the ceiling. There is an urgent need to expand safe routes and give people the chance to rebuild their lives in our country.\n|\n|\nDisabled by the Railway\n|\n|\nOn Monday, I was invited by my constituent Sam to join a petition hand-in on behalf of the National Federation for the Blind. This petition set out the organisation’s opposition to the Government’s so-called “modernisation” plans, which is really just a euphemism for cuts. As things stand, rail companies are failing to provide adequate service levels to all customers but this is even more pronounced for disabled customers in our area, who have faced failed assist after failed assist from train companies. Just last week, Sam herself was denied travel twice in a single day! Cutting staffing levels and slash ticket offices on our rail network would only reduce rail accessibility and safety, hitting the disabled hardest. When Downing Street itself is unable to provide the right ramp to get someone who uses a wheelchair up the door, what hope is there for our trains?\n|\n|\nSupporting NHS Workers with Keep Our NHS Public\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday afternoon, I met with campaigners from Keep Our NHS Public to take delivery of over 800 postcards from picket line supporters urging MPs to support NHS workers. Across our NHS, low pay levels and high stress levels are driving staff out, heaping further stress on those who stay. Any policymaker who is serious about addressing the crisis facing our health service would be pushing for the pay rise nurses, paramedics, and junior doctors are asking for.\n|\n|\nVisiting My Old Primary School\n|\n|\nIt was lovely to be back at my old school, Holy Trinity Church of England Primary, on Friday morning to answer some great questions on my role as Streatham’s MP and hear about their campaign on plastic pollution, which they’ve written to me about as well. I was also very pleased to bump into Leah, who designed one of the winning entries in my most recent Christmas card competition!\n|\n|\nPresenting Awards at the Jack Petchey Foundation’s Speak Out Challenge\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday evening, I had the honour of giving out awards at the Lambeth Regional Final of the Jack Petchey “Speak Out” Challenge – hosted at Dunraven School. For over two decades, the Jack Petchey Foundation and Speaker’s Trust have been empowering young people and investing in them. They not only provide them with the skills to be able to deliver such amazing speeches, but also the space to talk about the issues they care about.\n|\n|\nFinland Visit\n|\n|\nIt was great to be in Finland over Recess week with several Labour colleagues at the invitation of the Rosa Luxemburg Thinktank to see what a progressive government can do. We met with Finnish Parliament members, Government ministers and campaigners to see how innovative approaches to housing, public spaces, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental policy are improving life for the many.\n|\n|\nTackling Unequal Pay\n|\n|\nIt was great to chair a parliamentary event in support of Black Members in Unison’s campaign for mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting alongside my colleagues David Lammy MP, Anneliese Dodds MP, Florence Eshalomi MP, Anum Qaisar MP, and Gloria Mills. Your salary shouldn’t be limited by your gender, the colour of your skin or your disability. The Government should bring in mandatory pay gap reporting for ethnicity and other protected characteristics.\nThis week also saw he day when women start earning relative to men. With the gender pay gap now standing at 14.9%, women effectively worked from January 1st until the 23rd February for free. On current progress, it will be over 20 years before the UK closes our gender pay gap.\nThe Government must do more to ensure equal pay for equal work. That means fixing our broken childcare system, introducing a legal right to flexible working, forcing companies to publish action plans to address pay gaps or face fines, and bring in better leave rights for dads and partners.\n|\n|\nUnjust: We Need a New Approach to Cannabis Policy\n|\n|\nI was happy to host a great event with Unjust and Release in Parliament this week with special guest Kassandra Frederique of the USA’s Drug Policy Alliance. They have been instrumental in driving forwards better outcomes in the US, including pushing for a social equity approach to cannabis legalisation. The UK could learn a lot from this approach to cannabis, which is centred on evidence, harm reduction, and reversing the damage that criminalisation has done to black and working class communities.\n|\n|\nAdvancing Racial Equity in the Workplace\n|\n|\nOn Tuesday, I was invited to join the Advancing Racial Equity Conference at Landing Forty Two in Leadenhall to discuss how we can build truly equal workplaces. We talked about how we can ensure that experiences of racism are listened to and acted on at the level of policymaking. This is absolutely crucial if we are going to ensure nobody faces discrimination in the workplace.\n|\n|\nRacial Inclusion and Diversity in the Workplace\n|\nIt was great to speak to the Institute of Government and Public Policy’s third annual Race Inclusion and Workplace Diversity Conference to discuss some of the latest policies and best-case studies on overcoming barriers in building a diverse and inclusive workplace for everyone.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

We travelled north into Marsabit County to visit Demo and Burgabo: two remote areas of the country which have been decimated by one of the worst droughts in living memory.\nExtreme weather events in Africa killed at least 4,000 people and affected a further 19 million in 2022. Our visit took place after a year of widespread drought and famine across the east of the continent, serious flooding in Chad and Nigeria, severe storms in southern Africa, and raging wildfires in Tunisia. After four failed rainy seasons, water is scarce, crops aren’t growing, and livestock are dying. In some places it hasn’t rained for two years. In a country where livestock is people’s livelihoods, an estimated 1.5 million livestock died in Kenya alone during the failed 2022 March-May rainy season. We saw the devastating consequences of this first-hand and heard from people living in these communities.\nWith Kenya facing a debt crisis, the country is left confronting this dire situation with both hands tied behind its back. The work with organisations like CAFOD and Coalition for Global Prosperity do to mitigate the impact of climate breakdown in the region of East Africa is absolutely essential. Sadly, the Government’s decision to slash the aid budget puts many such projects at risk. I’ll keep pushing to reverse these cuts and push the Government to crack down on private lenders for their failure to provide debt relief.

On a recent visit to the Streatham Job Centre, I found out they’ve been dealing with a fourfold increase in the number of people claiming Universal Credit in the locality.\nIt would be unfair to say the current jobs crisis was completely self-inflicted but it’s increasingly clear that the failure of the Government’s public health strategy continues to hamper our economic recovery. The gamble of delaying lockdown in the early stages of the pandemic has left us with the worst of both worlds: a serious recession and a rising case rate. After months of Ministers promising us a working NHS test and trace system, what we got was an outsourced mess cobbled together by corner-cutting private companies, some of which had suspiciously close ties to the Government. Predictably, this buckled precisely at the moment we most needed it – when schools returned.\nAs with public health, so with the economy. Across the country, millions have been excluded from income support altogether, others have seen pay slashed, and many have been pushed onto Universal Credit. People in Streatham are struggling and not getting the support they need from this Government.\nOn current progress, many will be forced to burn through their savings (if they have any) or rack up debt to meet London living costs. UK food banks have seen an 81% increase since the outset of the pandemic and are getting ready for an even busier winter. In a worst-case scenario, people will be unable to buy the basics they need to survive.\nAccording to research published during lockdown, a majority of families on Universal Credit are still having to borrow just to make ends meet. Clearly, the Tories’ flagship welfare system is running on borrowed time.\nUnprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. We’ve seen time and again during this pandemic that nobody is safe until everybody is safe. That’s why I’ve called for the introduction of an emergency Universal Basic Income (UBI) to ensure everyone can cover the basics over the months ahead.\nIn the sixth-largest economy in the world, nobody should be having to choose between eating and heating their home. Rather than serving our broken economic system, we must instead build a system that serves everyone and paves the way for a just transition to a fairer, greener and more equal economy after the pandemic.\nThis article first appeared as a column in the South London Press on Friday 2nd October 2020 and on the South London Press website: https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/in-my-view-people-in-streatham-are-struggling-and-not-getting-the-support-they-need-from-this-government/",

The week began with efforts to deport refugees en masse to Rwanda. As the UN High Commissioner for refugees pointed out this week, this plan “violates the fundamental principles of refugees”. It was only thwarted in the European Court of Human Rights, which the Government is now wants to take the UK out of. The only two other countries to do this are Putin’s Russia (this year) and the Greek military dictatorship more than fifty years ago.\nThe Government also published a shameful Bill this week that would rip up the Northern Ireland Protocol they negotiated just over 18 months ago. This is a threat to peace in Northern Ireland and represents a breach of international law. It also has obvious implications for future trade deals (good luck negotiating trade deals when nobody can trust that you will stick to them).\nFinally, in news that will surprise exactly no one, Boris Johnson’s ethics adviser has resigned this week, the second person to do so during his tenure as PM. This farce is a reminder that we are still stuck in a groundhog day of revelations without repercussions. When we finally get this shower out of government, it’s absolutely vital that we strengthen standards in public life to clean up Westminster politics.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn and around Streatham\nOpposing the Sell-Off of our Local Surgeries\n|\n|\nWarning people about the sell-off with protesters early last year.\n|\nLast year, the Government allowed American healthcare company Centene to buy up 49 GP surgeries across London through its UK subsidiary Operose Health – including three right here in our constituency. This week, a BBC Panorama exposé revealed how this company is endangering safety in the pursuit of profit, with staff shortages, underqualified medical and administrative staff and massive referral backlogs.\nThe US corporate takeover of our health services isn’t a distant threat, but a present reality. Instead of pouring NHS money into the coffers of corner-cutting US corporations, the Government must reinstate our NHS as a fully public service that works for people, not profit. I’ve consistently campaigned for these surgeries to be taken out of Operose Health’s hands and run by a company that can deliver the standard of service that people in Streatham deserve and will continue to do so.\n|\n|\nRefugees Welcome: Opposing the Hostile Environment\n|\n|\nThe Government’s Rwanda deportation plans are nothing more than state-sanctioned people trafficking. Their deranged insistence on pushing ahead with this week’s £500,000 flight is an incredibly expensive way to demonstrate their racist credentials and commitment to persecuting refugees. I was proud to join protesters on Monday ahead of the flight to show the scale of opposition to the inhumane treatment of people who just want to rebuild their lives here in safety. Instead of subjecting people who’ve fled war, persecution and climate breakdown to further upheaval and trauma, we should be taking in our fair share of refugees and giving them a fair chance to rebuild their lives in safety.\n|\n|\nOn Thursday, I joined South London Refugee Association for a beautiful event to commemorate ten years since the launch of the Hostile Environment. From Go Home vans to the Windrush Scandal and Rwanda deportations, this has ruined countless lives. But recent events show communities fighting back against the attacks on our neighbours, friends, and loved ones, and resisting scapegoating. It should be obvious to anyone that refugees are not responsible for problems with housing, healthcare and education; these are the responsibility of the government that has been in power for the last twelve years.\n|\n|\nConference of the Black Child\n|\n|\nLast Saturday was a very special occasion, marking 35 years since the first Black MPs were elected to Parliament. It was great to join the longest serving of them, Diane Abbott MP, to celebrate this momentous date. What more fitting way to mark the day than with a conference to explore how we can build a school system where children can learn free from racism. It was great to chair the plenary panel on the Conference for the Black Child at Stoke Newington School and discuss dismantling racism in schools with inspiring educators, activists and trade unionists.\n|\n|\nWorld Blood Donor Day\n|\n|\nThe shortage of Black blood donors in the UK means we urgently need more people from African and Caribbean communities to come forwards and give blood. That’s why I recently took part in the Bonded by Blood donation drive in memory of Richard Okorogheye. On World Blood Donor Day, I urged people to come forwards and give blood and reiterated my call for the Government to do its part too. Discriminatory blood donation laws were removed last year, but they still cast a long shadow. With thousands of new Black Blood donors required, the Government must work to build community confidence, make giving blood inclusive & ensure everyone’s healthcare needs are met\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLabour Opposition Days\n|\n|\nThis week, Labour held an Opposition Day on Passport Office delays and the proposed privatisation of Channel Four. Boris Johnson recently claimed at PMQs that everybody is getting their passport within six weeks. In reality, his own data shows that over people faced ten-week plus Passport Office delays in the first three months of 2021 alone. Labour highlighted the Government failures behind this: from staffing cuts to their inability to prepare for the summer spike in demand, and refusals to hold outsourcing companies to account for overcharging, underperforming, and still losing hundreds of passports every year.\nI was also happy to vote for our motion calling for an apology in light of this and support the motion opposing the privatisation of Channel Four, which would be an act of cultural and economic vandalism. We can’t let them take an axe to Channel Four just because they’re determined to destroy any institution that holds them to account.\nHave you been waiting months for a passport or driving licence? Have your travel plans been disrupted? Are you still waiting for a hospital appointment?\n|\n|\n|\n|\nWe Need a Comprehensive Ban on Conversion Therapy\n|\n|\nLGBT+ conversion therapy is more accurately described as torture. It must be banned in all forms and in its use against all members of the LGBT+ community. I was unable to get in on this week’s debate on Trans Conversion Therapy but from the hundreds of emails I’ve received from constituents, the opposition to this in our constituency couldn’t be clearer.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_24th-june-newsletter/content_565.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n24th June 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThis week saw the long-awaited publication of the Privileges Committee Report into Boris Johnson’s statements to the House of Commons regarding Partygate. Of course, we didn’t need another report to tell us that serial liar Johnson knowingly broke the stringent Covid rules he imposed on the rest of us and knowingly lied about it. However, it was important to hold him to account for lying to Parliament and the public that voted us in.\n|\n|\nI voted to accept the report’s findings. Whilst 118 Tory MPs also joined me, the vast majority abstained, and seven rebels even went so far as to reject the findings in a last stand for their beloved former boss. Rishi Sunak, who abstained, claimed that he “didn’t want to influence” proceedings. This excuse is about as plausible as his predecessor’s claims that he didn’t know there were parties going on in his own home. As I said during the debate, the entire party has been complicit in this scandal from start to finish, going along with Boris Johnson’s lies until it became apparent just how unpopular a figure he had become.\n|\n|\nWindrush 75\n|\n|\nThis week, we celebrated 75 years of the Windrush generation’s contribution to Britain. It was a bittersweet commemoration as we reflected on all that the Windrush generation have given to this country and all that has been taken from them.\n|\n|\nLambeth claims a special place in Windrush history, as one of the first places that people arriving from the Caribbean into the UK settled. Many on the crossing which docked 75 years ago today first slept in the bomb shelter beneath Clapham South station. More still on subsequent crossings eventually settled in and around Brixton, which was the site of the nearest labour exchange. We are proud to be the place that so many Windrush pioneers arriving in Britain first called home, and proud too of all they have contributed to the culture and ongoing successes of our area.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIt was an honour to be involved in celebrations across the borough this week to mark Windrush Day and see so many people proudly celebrating the Windrush history and culture that has made Lambeth the area we love to live in today. On Tuesday, I was honoured to lay a wreath at the African and Caribbean War Memorial in tribute to the often forgotten Commonwealth servicemen who served and died during both World Wars. On Windrush Day itself, I joined Corpus Christi Primary School for an assembly and display of drumming, joined Stockwell Good Neighbours and Tony’s Happy Drums for their Windrush celebrations, joined a vibrant and joyful Windrush Procession, and joined the hundreds who gathered in Windrush Square to watch a display of music and dance in appreciation of Lambeth’s rich Windrush heritage. Thank you to everyone in our community for coming together and putting on a celebration worthy of this momentous date!\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStop and Search\n|\n|\nThis week, the Home Secretary was once again setting out her stall for the inevitable Tory leadership election. I was present in the House for a statement on her decision to ramp up the use of stop and search. As an MP in a borough with one of the highest stop and search rates in London and the lowest police confidence levels in London, I have long called for a review of these powers. I believe that judicious, evidence-based stop and search can play a role in keeping us safe. But suspicionless stop and search powers are clearly counter-productive. There is very little concrete evidence to suggest they do much to keep us safe but plenty to show how disproportionately they are deployed.\nAs I pointed out in my intervention, this decision will do nothing to repair strained relations between people and the police. If the Government was focused on keeping all our young people safe, they would be looking to reverse cuts to education and youth services, tackle the issue of school exclusions, expand mental healthcare provision and address the deprivation and inequality that drives people to commit crimes.\n|\n|\nSupporting Striking Cleaners at\nStreatham & Clapham High School\n|\n|\nOn Tuesday, I joined a rainy picket line with cleaners from Streatham and Clapham High School during their third day of strike action. These outsourced workers are asking for a fair pay rise and proper sick pay and annual leave entitlements from the contractor that employs them. I’ve written to the school asking them to facilitate this. As part of a network of schools that continues to turn a healthy profit, there is no excuse not to negotiate with the cleaners and try to meet their demands. If the contractor refuses to meet them, then the school should bring these workers back in house.\n|\n|\nLambeth Council Pride Reception\n|\n|\nIt was wonderful to be at Lambeth Council’s first ever Pride reception on Wednesday night with my fellow Lambeth MPs Florence Eshalomi and Helen Hayes. It was great to pay tribute to some of the local activists who fought and continue to fight to overcome prejudice. Thank you to Clapham Town Councillor David Robson for organising an amazing celebration of our thriving LGBTQ+ community.\n|\n|\nSportInspired: Improving Young People’s Wellbeing\n|\n|\nOn Thursday morning, I also managed to squeeze in a visit to Brixton Recreation Centre at the invitation of SportInspired, alongside my fellow Lambeth MP Florence Eshalomi. It was great to observe the work SportInspired does to bring young people together in our area through sport, putting them on a pathway to a better future. Giving children these opportunities early in life has so many positive implications for their physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.\n|\n|\nSave Brixton Hill Studios\n|\n|\nI continue to push Brixton Hill Studios’ landlord, Lexadon Property Group, over their disgraceful 133% rent rise, which is jeopardising the future of this cherished community asset. In response to my earlier letter, I was disappointed to receive a response from the CEO which completely failed to acknowledge the importance of this site to the local community. I am concerned that this does not seem to factor into the business plans of a landlord which owns huge swathes of commercial property in our area. I wrote to Lexadon once again, urging them to extend the lease and save Brixton Hill Studios. I’m very pleased to see the campaign picking up traction in the press and among local councillors.\n|\n|\nImportant Votes\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the EU Retained Law Bill was back before MPs for consideration of Lords amendments. I voted in favour of amendments that would have made it harder for the Government to tear up baseline environmental protections and enhanced parliamentary scrutiny over scrapping other laws. Sadly, the Tories voted them down. The Right’s vision of post-Brexit Britain was never really about parliamentary sovereignty or pursuing higher standards.\nWednesday afternoon also saw the return of the Anti-Strikes Bill for consideration of Lords amendments. I voted in favour of several amendments that would have stopped nurses, teachers and other public service workers from facing the sack and stopped their trade unions from facing sanctions when these workers call strikes. As I’ve maintained throughout this Bill’s passage, it’s not an attempt to ensure minimum service levels, it’s about stopping workers from using the best tool they have to demand them.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

As the damage wrought by thirteen devastating years of right-wing policies becomes clearer and clearer, the Tories are sinking deeper into their last redoubt: racism and scapegoating.\nThis legislation isn’t going to work on its own terms, it’s about creating an unworkable situation that the Tories can politically exploit at the next election instead of standing on their dismal track record on living standards and public services. It is an attempt to recast refugees crossing in small boats as “illegal migrants”, even though we know 75% of those making the crossings are granted asylum. People are no less deserving of human rights, dignity, or compassion because of the dangerous routes they have to take to reach safety. We need to push for safe routes, international cooperation and quicker asylum decisions.",

However, for many, a large rent hike is just a no fault eviction by another name.

Almost 862 small businesses are likely to have seen turnover plummet by more than half – even before the imposition of a second national lockdown.\nLabour has also revealed that 1,682 small businesses in Streatham are unlikely to have more than three months of cash reserves. Yet the vast majority of businesses required to close have received much smaller grants from government than they did during the first lockdown – with most receiving either just a third or half of what they received in March.\nThe news comes as London’s Public Health Chief warned that London may enter Tier 3 in the coming review.5 This week, Bell voted against the new tier system on the basis that the measures were ineffective at combatting the spread of the virus, inadequate in their limited financial support, and inconsistent overall.\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour Member of Parliament for Streatham, said:\n“These figures confirm what small business owners in Streatham have been telling us for months: the Government isn’t giving businesses in our area the support they need to make it through a difficult winter.\n“Small businesses have backed us over the course of the pandemic with independent cafes giving out free coffee for NHS workers, computer repair specialists offering to repair laptops at no cost and one local firm laser-cutting PPE for care homes.\n“Now the Government must back them. Many small businesses in our area won’t survive the winter unless the Government brings forwards additional funding.”\nLabour’s Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband said:\n“Small businesses are the beating heart of towns and cities across the country – shops, pubs, manufacturers, salons, suppliers and all those that make up the vibrant fabric of our communities.\n“But they’re facing a cash crisis and being let down by shrinking government grants which simply won’t cover their rents and overheads. Unless Ministers change course, we’ll see hardworking businesses go bust and high streets crumbling before winter is through.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n1. All data based on responses from latest ONS Business Impact of Coronavirus Survey (19 October – 01 November). This shows:\n- 15% of very small businesses and 9% of small businesses have low or no confidence of surviving the next three months. If this proportion is replicated in the Streatham constituency, this would represent almost 800 small businesses.\n- 20% of very small businesses and 16% of small businesses saw turnover plunge by more than 50% over a fortnight survey period, before the second national lockdown was imposed. This would represent almost 862 small businesses.\n- 10% of very small businesses and 6% of small businesses had no cash reserves, and a further 28% of very small businesses and 32% of small businesses had cash reserves to last them for under 1 month to 3 months. This would represent more than 1682 small businesses.\n2.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_22nd-november-2022/content_616.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n22nd November 2022\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThis week saw the long-awaited Autumn Statement, which set out another raft of measures that shelter the rich whilst squeezing the rest. Hunt talked a lot about “global headwinds” in Thursday’s speech but the Government refuse to acknowledge the fact that the UK is the only G7 country with a smaller economy than before the pandemic. Worse still, we are forecast to have the lowest growth of all 38 OECD countries over next two years. The British people deserve so much better than this grim economic outlook of rising energy bills, crumbling public services and falling pay.\nAusterity is a political choice; not an economic necessity. It didn’t work over the last twelve years and it isn’t going to now. Instead of hammering public services, the Government should be following the money and taxing the windfalls of pandemic and war. In our rigged economy, these have largely benefitted big corporations and the very richest in our society. Maintaining basic levels of public investment, income, and public services, should be any government’s first priority.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStop Tory Bus Cuts: Save the 45!\n|\n|\nThis week, I wrote to the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, reiterating my call to protect the 45 bus route between Clapham Park and Elephant & Castle. The Tories’ failure to cover TfL’s lost Covid revenues has left London’s bus network facing major cuts. As a constituency without a tube station, I know these cuts present a real worry for many residents. All the evidence shows that losing bus services will disproportionately impact people on low incomes, people from Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds, disabled people and pregnant women. The Tories must stop swinging the axe at our transport infrastructure.\n|\n|\nMarching with Midwives\n|\n|\nOn Sunday afternoon, I joined midwives in our NHS to march on Parliament and highlight the emergency in UK maternity care. Most people in modern Britain owe our lives to a midwife but failures to address chronic staff shortages and invest in maternity services now leave them under incredible strain.\nMidwifery services are at breaking point, with shortages of more than 3,500 midwives across the UK. For every 30 midwives that train to enter the profession, 29 are leaving or never entering the workforce. 60% of midwives surveyed last year were considering quitting their jobs. Up to 30% of all mothers rate their birth as traumatic. This is an unacceptable level in a wealthy country like the UK and reflects the chronic under-resourcing of our health service.\nAs the Royal College of Midwives itself has stated: “Not a day goes by that we don’t hear of a maternity service having to close temporarily, suspend services or divert women to other maternity units just because there simply aren’t enough midwives. This can’t continue because we know it compromises safety and means women don’t always get the safe positive pregnancy and birth experience that they should.”\nA year on from last year’s ground-breaking demonstrations, nothing has changed. The Royal College of Midwives will ballot in Scotland, England, and Wales on industrial action this Autumn. Early indications suggesting there is a genuine appetite for a strike. It doesn’t need to be this way. All midwives want is the resources to do their job safely and provide care. It’s time for the Government to close the staffing gap and bring forward the necessary funding to give midwives, mothers and parents the level of care they all deserve.\n|\n|\nVisiting the MSI Reproductive Choices Clinic\n|\n|\nThis week, I visited MSI Reproductive Choices clinic on Brixton Hill to see first-hand the important work that staff are doing to support women in our area in the face of staffing challenges, funding shortages and targeted anti-abortion protests. I was very concerned to hear that in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s decisions, anti-abortion activists in the UK have felt emboldened to step their protests up. I was told by staff that they’ve gone from happening once a month to being a weekly feature.\nSeeking an abortion can be a difficult decision that comes with unnecessary shame and stigma and having to pass through a gauntlet of people only makes one of the hardest days of a woman’s life even harder. That’s why I’ve called on Lambeth Council to implement a buffer zone outside the clinic.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBuilding a Safer Streatham\n|\nTogether, Streatham Youth Community Trust and Lambeth Connects are creating a safe space to discuss the impact of violence on our community. Their first meeting takes place at 6:30pm on Monday the 21st of November at 16 Wellfield Road (SW16 2BP). Find out more about their community outreach pilot 👇🏾\n|\n|\n|\nChristmas Card Competition\n|\n|\nThis week, I launched my 2022 Christmas Card competition. Every year, kids in our community get the chance to design my annual Christmas card, which goes out to thousands of people in Streatham, Brixton Hill, Clapham Common, Tulse Hill and Balham. This year’s theme is Festive Streatham. I’m on the lookout for entries that capture the distinctive feel of Christmas in our constituency. Think about Christmas light displays and festive shop windows on Streatham High Road, a dusting of snow on Clapham Common, the Christmas Farmers’ Market in Balham, skating at Streatham ice rink, carols on our estates with Brixton Chamber Orchestra, or anything else that makes you think of Christmas in our community.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNehemiah Surgery\n|\n|\nThe Nehemiah Project is an independent recovery charity which works with vulnerable adult men with a history of addiction. On Friday, I organised a pop-up surgery to help residents with a range of issues they were experiencing. These ranged from housing issues to issues with the council and the justice system.\n|\n|\nCelebrating Brazilian Black Awareness Day\n|\n|\nEvery year on the 20th of November, Brazil marks Black Awareness Day to reflect on the history of Black people in Brazil. I joined Afro-Id UK for a special event to mark the day, which coincides with the death of Zumbi dos Palmares, a pioneering anti-slavery fighter whose story reminds us of the interconnectedness of racial, social end environmental justice. It was great to find out more about Brazil’s rich history of resistance to slavery in particular and support their mission promoting anti-racist education and recovering occluded histories.\n|\n|\nAfruika Bantu Saturday School Black History Event\n|\nOn Saturday, I joined the Afruika Bantu Saturday School (ABSS), based in Tulse Hill, for their 21st Memorial Lecture. ABSS was established in 1996 as a Saturday school to deliver education to children of African Heritage between the ages of 5-16 years old. As well as teaching Maths, Science and English, the Afruika Bantu School also teaches Black history. The focus of this year’s event was the recent fatal police shooting of Chris Kaba and I was happy to contribute to the discussion.\n|\n|\nVotes at 16\n|\n|\nIn my work as an MP, I’m passionate about teaching our kids about the power they have as citizens. I’m a firm believer that our democracy is enriched when everyone has the opportunity to participate. So it was great to join my friend and constituency neighbour Florence Eshalomi for a fantastic Votes at 16 parliamentary event on Tuesday. We met some inspiring young people from Lambeth to discuss lowering the voting age and other ways to ensure young people have a meaningful say on decisions that impact their lives.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_queens-speech-2021/content_615.html": "Every year, at the State Opening of Parliament, the Government sets out its plans for the next year in the Queen’s Speech. This is followed by several days of debate in Parliament on a series of topics chosen by the opposition. I spoke on day four of the debate, raising the housing crisis and calling for action on the cladding scandal.\nI also supported amendments from the Labour frontbench and other colleagues, including a hard deadline of June 2022 to remove all cladding, bereavement support for the children of unmarried couples, a Windfall Tax on super profits, a wealth tax on the super-rich, and a 55% tax rate for incomes over £200,000.\nThe 31 Bills announced by the Government this year laid down a clear anti-democratic agenda, building on similar legislation brought forwards in the last session (the Overseas Operations Bill and the Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill). They sent a clear message that rather than focusing on the damage of the pandemic and delivering on their levelling up agenda, Boris Johnson’s Government are more interested in consolidating wealth and power. Several Bills raise particular concerns for me.\nPolice Crackdown Bill\nIn the last Parliament, the Tories were forced to drop plans for the dismal Policing, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill, more accurately dubbed the Police Crackdown Bill. Unfortunately, we’ve not seen the last of this Bill, which is the Government’s response to the successful protest movements of recent years, including Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion. Campaigners forced important concessions from Conservative governments, leaving them with no choice but to promise to act on two of the major social issues of our time. This Queen’s Speech is a reminder that the Government would rather take action to ban protesters than take action to tackle the injustices they raise.\nElectoral Integrity Bill\nThis is the Government’s attempt at Republican-style voter suppression, introducing new burdens on voters. The equalities impacts of such a move have been well studied. If you are poorer, disabled, trans, or from an ethnic minority background, you are much less likely to own valid photo ID. Clearly, that’s the whole point. In a country where the largest single party at the last General Election was “Did not vote”, we need to look at improving democratic participation and inclusion, not erect new barriers to keep people out.\nHigher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill\nThis Bill makes good on Gavin Williamson’s promise to introduce campus free speech enforcers. As my colleague Charlotte Nichols pointed out, this legislation potentially introduces a loophole that would give Holocaust deniers legal protections. The biggest threat to free speech on university campuses is not student societies disinviting Conservative MPs and far-right figures from addressing events, it’s the Government threatening the freedom of student societies to choose who speaks at their events.\nLet me know your thoughts on the Government’s new agenda.

This month, I hosted an Eid Party for some of these families at Agnes Riley Gardens.

Last year, more than a million children took part in their school programmes. I joined Sunnyhill Primary pupils for lunch to see the programme in action.

With 4 million children facing food poverty in the UK, there’s so much work to do to ensure every child enjoys a nutritious diet.

By repeatedly u-turning on these issues, they were only adding to mounting financial worries for retirees (especially the one quarter of London pensioners already living in poverty) and families who need benefits to get by. I voted to protect the Triple Lock on pensions as part of a Labour Opposition Day on the issue, which sought to held the Conservatives’ feet to the fire on this. It’s a scandal that some retirees are worrying about whether they can afford to turn the heating on or use the toaster. Another effective cut to pensions would have added insult to injury.\nProtecting Pensions\nShare this page",

Our care workers have been overworked and undervalued for too long. I supported the Future Social Care Coalition’s Pay Fair for Care Day of Action. The Government’s repeated failure to deliver a long- term plan for social care jeopardises the sector’s recovery after the pandemic.\nCovid has exposed the crisis in social care yet again. There are more than 1.5 million people in the UK with unmet care needs and 112,000 vacancies in the sector. On top of this the sector is likely to see more staff departures this year, with one third currently considering a career move. We simply cannot afford to leave the social care unaddressed any longer. This starts with paying all our care workers a real living wage.\n[insert graphic from Feb-March AMM report]",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_29th-april-newsletter/content_608.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n29th April 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThe UK has been marking the third annual Black Maternal Health Awareness week over the last few days. As the week began, the latest data showed that Black women in the UK are:\n-\nFour times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth.\n-\nTwo times more likely to face stillbirth.\n-\n80-83% more likely to have a near miss.\n-\n50% more likely to face neonatal loss.\n-\n43% more likely to miscarry.\n|\n|\nI founded the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Black Maternal Health because we need to change these statistics, which we have known about for decades. The colour of a mother’s skin should have no bearing on her health outcomes or her baby’s. It was good to convene a packed-out meeting in Parliament this week with campaigners, healthcare professionals, and other MPs to discuss the progress made on tackling the issue and what more can be done to eliminate these disparities.\nWhilst the Government has announced policies aiming to tackle inequalities in maternity care, a recent Women and Equalities Committee Report was clear that they have failed to properly resource these measures. I would have liked to see the Government using this week to set an example and commit to implementing the recommendations of these reports in full. In particular, we need a clear, measurable, and binding target to end these disparities.\n|\n|\nOn Friday, I also sent a letter to every NHS trust in England, asking about plans to tackle the health inequalities facing Black mothers. The lack of action from the government has led many Trusts to pilot their own schemes. We can learn a lot from the work they are already doing to improve maternity care for Black women and birthing people.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nRishi Sunak Refuses to Offer Formal Government Apology for Slavery and Colonialism\n|\n|\nDuring this week’s Prime Minister’s Question Time, I called on Rishi Sunak to offer a formal government apology for Britain’s role in slavery and colonialism. He flat out refused, saying “no… trying to unpick our history is not the right way forwards”. But the racism and inequality that persists in the present has its roots in our imperial past. I firmly believe that the only way we can move forwards as a society is through a full and honest reckoning with the history that created the country, and indeed the world we live in today.\nThe United Kingdom has never officially apologised for the suffering inflicted on people through the violence of the transatlantic slave trade and colonial rule. When we talk about reparations, people often try to reduce the conversation to a question of payments and large sums of money. But no quantity of money could put these evils right. As I set out in my maiden speech, I would like the Government to start with some simple things like returning looted artefacts residing in British museums, cancelling debts that have been repaid over and over, and yes, apologising.\n|\n|\nCleaning up Our Waters: Ending the Sewage Scandal\n|\n|\nSince 2016 alone, water companies have piped 1,276 years’ worth of raw sewage into our waterways. This year, they’ve announced an 8% bill increase – the biggest for 20 years. Labour held an Opposition Day on Tuesday calling for action to end the sewage scandal. Our Party is proposing mandatory monitoring on sewage outlets, automatic fines for discharges, real targets to end sewage dumping and accountability for water bosses. Instead of voting for these clear measures to clean up our water, the Tories chose once again to vote this down and play shenanigans. They say they want to end these discharges but as they drag their feet again and again, it’s clear that it’s not only our waterways that are full of it.\n|\n|\nSupporting People Who Have Fled the World’s Worst Horrors\n|\n|\nThis week, I once again voted against the latest Tory attack on some of the most vulnerable people in the world. When this Bill was last before Parliament, I tabled a cross-party reasoned amendment to throw it out. This legislation would see people who’ve escaped some of the most horrific conditions denied safety, detained, and deported. As the damage wrought by thirteen devastating years of right-wing policies becomes clearer and clearer, the Tories are sinking deeper into their last redoubt: racism and scapegoating. A tiny number of the world’s displaced people end up in Britain. We need to treat those who do with care and compassion. People who’ve escaped some of the worst horrors shouldn’t have to risk their lives again just to reach safety. We need viable safe routes, not another blatant attack on refugees to divide and distract communities.\n|\n|\nWelcoming our new Lambeth Mayor\n|\n|\nThis week saw our new Lambeth Mayor Sarbaz Barznji officially taking up the role. It was great to be at Lambeth Town Hall on Wednesday with our other Lambeth MPs to see Sarbaz sworn in. His chosen charities for the year are Brixton Soup Kitchen and Care 4 Calais. I’m looking forwards to working with Sarbaz over the coming year and know he will make an amazing champion for our community.\n|\n|\n|\nCommunity Safety Update\n|\nI was very worried to hear news of a firearms incident in Rama Close on Monday evening, which left a man in a life-threatening condition. His condition has now thankfully stabilised and the police have charged a 32-year-old man. I was also deeply saddened by news of last week’s fatal house fire on Buckleigh Road. My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of the man who has died and I’m grateful as ever to the emergency service workers who attended and have been looking into the cause of the blaze.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

In England, the Government’s target to halve stillbirths and neonatal deaths by 2025 compared to 2010 levels is not on target. The report makes some vital recommendations to address this: targets to save babies’ lives in every UK nation, tackling staffing shortages in maternity services, more investment in research, improved data collection, and ensuring lessons are learned from baby deaths.\nWe must keep working to ensure every mother and every baby receives the standard of care they deserve.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_the-answer-to-violence-against-women-and-girls-cannot-simply-be-more-police/content_83.html": "On Saturday evening, people around the country reacted with justified anger to images and video footage of police manhandling women who turned up to a vigil for Sarah Everard. Chants of “let her speak” turned to “shame on you” as police officers proceeded to kettle attendees and break up the gathering at Clapham Common bandstand.\nIt is bitterly ironic that a gathering about the public safety of women was prevented from going ahead on the grounds of public safety. Still more so when we remember that just this week the government’s chief scientific advisers told MPs there was little evidence that such outdoor gatherings were significant drivers of transmission. Of course, Covid-19 safety concerns are valid – but so are the safety concerns of women in my constituency. The police had every opportunity to strike the right balance and repeatedly refused to do so.\nOver the course of the week, the Met were repeatedly warned – by the event organisers, by myself, and others – that they could not simply cancel the vigil. After initial meetings where Lambeth Borough officers made efforts to compromise with the event organisers, they were eventually overruled from high up. Because of Scotland Yard’s decision, local officers in my constituency will be left to deal with the fallout from the weekend, and the further burden this will undoubtedly place on already strained community relationships.\nThe disgraceful scenes that ensued at the Clapham Common vigil make it clear that the answer to gender violence cannot simply be more police. This is the latest in a long string of incidents that raises serious questions about institutional forms of discrimination within the Metropolitan Police.\nBetween rising racial disproportionalities in the use of stop and search, complicity in historic state violence against women and officers casually taking selfies with the murdered bodies of two Black women, it’s very clear that this problem is more than skin deep. We don’t just need a changing of the guard, we need institutional overhaul.\nAbove all, policing requires community consent. The primary purpose of the police is to keep the peace and keep people safe. They cannot do this without listening to and making every effort to understand the communities they serve. It was evident that the strength of community feeling meant that people were always going to show up and make their voices heard. Given the prime suspect in Sarah’s murder, we knew that if the Met were seen to be preventing the vigil, there would be a backlash.\nIn the wake of this weekend’s events, the government will seek a second reading on its police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which has been aptly described by The Good Law Project as an attempt to “legislate protest out of meaningful existence”.\nDuring the pandemic, parliament has never actually legislated to explicitly ban protest. The problem is that police forces across the country have acted as if this is the case. This situation is clearly untenable but further criminalising the right to protest, especially amid rising awareness of such injustices, will only mean more instances like the one we saw in my constituency this weekend.\nThe police, crime, sentencing and courts bill seeks to make “serious annoyance” to the public, or a section of the public, an offence punishable by a maximum ten-year prison sentence in a clear response to the mass civil disobedience tactics of Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter protests of recent times. It would also mean harsher penalties for damaging a statue than for attacking a woman.\nAfter Saturday night, my inbox is already full of constituents calling on me to oppose the latest attempt to crack down on the right to protest. I’m glad that the Labour leadership will vote against the bill this week. This is in itself a reminder of the power of protest, and the absolute necessity of a full-throated defence of it. The Labour Party must come together to resist attacks on the right to protest and free assembly.\nThis article first appeared over at LabourList on the 15th March 2021.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_unconditional-bailouts-for-big-business-dont-make-sense-we-cant-go-back-to-big-business-as-usual/content_377.html": "Coronavirus is leaving no area of life untouched. In the space of a couple of months, we’ve seen governments around the world announcing economic interventions on a scale unseen since the crash of 2008.\nA crisis this big requires action on a similar scale: immediate action to support businesses, maintain employment and ensure that the recovery plan works in the collective interest.\nPlaced in an international context, the UK government’s response has been shockingly limited. The staggering rise in universal credit applications reflects significant gaps in current support measures for employees and small businesses alike: the failure to raise sick pay to cover basic living costs, the delay in money for small businesses and self-employed people and the absence of financial measures to support renters.\nThere’s not much appetite for business as usual among the working population on the sharp end of these measures and making personal sacrifices in the name of a common good. They don’t just want to hear that we’re all in this together; they want to see it.\nThere’s little doubt that we’re heading for the second worst economic recession in history. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2 per cent during the first three months of 2020. March alone saw a record 5.8 per cent drop, which was the driving force behind the overall contraction. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said we are facing a “severe impact” from Covid-19 – which is all the more reason for us to make sure we take the correct action to get the UK back on its feet.\nWe should learn from our previous mistakes. In 2008, big business got a bailout, while working people got the biggest wage squeeze since the Napoleonic era, with rising living costs and swingeing cuts to public services. In many ways, coronavirus has pried open the old wounds of austerity, which never fully healed for many anyway. This time, our recovery must put people before profit.\nCalling government support measures bailouts is something of a misnomer. Done properly, keeping businesses afloat and supporting workers will be a boon for the majority, not a blot on the balance sheet. The current situation should be the chance to invest and chart a new path away from devastating austerity policies of recent years. The emphasis has to be on good business.\nUnconditional bailouts will only hobble our recovery and plunge more people into a worse situation than they were in before coronavirus. That’s why now is exactly the right time to talk about how businesses should conduct themselves if they want to draw on government support. We’ve written to the chancellor with cross party support suggesting three essential conditions that big businesses seeking state support should follow to qualify:\n- They must not be registered in tax havens.\n- They must implement a moratorium on dividend payouts and share buybacks.\n- They must curb excessive executive pay.\nThese are simple, common sense measures that would help ensure better compliance from UK companies in future. People have limited sympathy for CEOs going cap in hand to ask for state support when those same CEOs have previously decided it’s not in their remit to support the state. Equally, companies are going to have a tough time explaining to the public why they should be given state money if they’re just going to line executives’ and shareholders’ pockets.\nAround the world, the current crisis is making it clear that we can’t go back to big business as usual. Some countries have already taken positive action against tax avoiders. Denmark, Belgium, France and Poland have all adopted similar measures to those we’ve proposed.\nIn the wake of coronavirus, there’s an emerging new consensus that government support should never be unconditional and public money must always be used in the public interest. Whatever happens, we must do all we can to put people, not profit, at the heart of the next recovery.\nWe can’t allow businesses to fail: people’s jobs depend on it. Big business needs to stop taking big liberties and being a big employer needs to come with some big responsibilities.\nThis article was co-authored with Apsana Begum is (Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse), Zarah Sultana (Labour MP for Coventry South), and Claudia Webbe (Labour MP for Leicester East and first appeared online at Independent Voices: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/coronavirus-economic-recovery-bailouts-businesses-a9512076.html",

We’ve seen some amazing and original initiatives getting off the ground here. Whether it’s local people donating their used devices to disadvantaged school pupils, food banks managing to meet an 134% increase in demand, or mutual aid groups springing up to help the community, we’ve seen people pulling together and innovating.\nI’ve been impressed at how local small businesses have thrown themselves into the coronavirus response. Whilst the big chains have shut up shop, we’ve seen independent coffee shops giving away free coffee to NHS workers, computer repair specialists offering to repair laptops at no cost and one local firm laser-cutting PPE for care homes.\nSmall businesses aren’t just the lifeblood of our economy, they’re the lifeblood of our community and they’re getting a raw deal. The UK High Street had already fallen on hard times before the current crisis came and put the brakes on trading. One study published at the start of lockdown suggested under current policy measures, up to 20% of the UK’s businesses would run out of cash by the end of April. The unfortunate truth about coronavirus business measures so far is that the smaller you are, the smaller your support.\nSmall businesses already found themselves on an uneven playing field before the coronavirus. So far, Government relief has come in the form of saddling small businesses with further debt, whether it’s by offering them loans (at high interest rates) through commercial and retail lenders or effectively deferring their rent payments.\nAs the Treasury offers no-strings attached loans to companies registered in tax havens, uptake on small business loans remains low. 2017’s business rates revaluation means the average small shop will see a £3,663 hike over the next 5 years, while large supermarket chains will see 6% reductions. It can’t be fair that some independent cafes contribute to the taxman at a higher effective rate than big High Street names.\nThere’s a growing consensus that we can’t go back to business as usual when the crisis is over. The economic case for stronger Government intervention couldn’t be clearer and the stakes couldn’t be higher. The cost of bankrupt businesses, unemployed workers and lost tax revenue far outweighs the cost of acting. But allowing small businesses to go bust isn’t just bad policy, risking a deeper recession and job losses, it’s also a hammer blow to communities. That makes it all the more important for the Government to learn from mistakes so far and get its second round of support right.\nThis article first appeared as a column in the South London Press on Friday 15th May 2020.",

Overwhelmingly, the people who are being forced to put their health at risk in a premature return to work are in working-class manual jobs. These workers can’t do their jobs from home and were already disproportionately infected and affected by coronavirus – as today’s occupational ONS data shows.\n“We’re back in the all-too familiar situation where people are being asked to choose to safeguard their health or experience financial hardship. Without binding commitments on employers and clear workplace enforcement measures, workers are forced to rely on the good will of their employers or face losing their jobs.\n“I’d point out two things to any workers in Streatham who feel unsafe. Firstly, it’s your right to challenge an unsafe workplace under Section 44 of the 1996 Employment Act. Secondly, joining a union before your return to work will mean you can draw on their support as well.”\nFor further information about this press release, please contact Ollie Collard, Communications Officer, Office of Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP at oliver.collard@parliament.uk or on 07918110617.\nNotes:\n- ‘Coronavirus (COVID-19) related deaths by occupation, England and Wales: deaths registered up to and including 20 April 2020’, Office of National Statistics,\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020",

In 100 days of violence, more than 10,000 Palestinian children have been killed by airstrikes and ground operations. The average age of a killed child? Just five. Recent polling shows that 71% of people in Britain believe there should be an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

If our democracy is to work for everyone, it must include everyone.\nThere is a correlation between the state of our politics and who is and isn’t registered to vote. At the last election, the Electoral Commission found that whilst 94% of owner-occupiers were registered to vote, just 64% of private renters are.\nWith 1 in 5 households renting their homes in the private sector, private renters are a huge constituency. Yet renters’ under-representation at the ballot box makes it easier for governments to deprioritise the urgent changes required to improve renters’ security. Banning No Fault Evictions, more affordable rents, and action on bad landlords are all things that require pressure on elected representatives.\nYoung people and those of us from Black, Asian, and mixed-race backgrounds are also much less likely to be registered to vote. If we are going to tackle the intergenerational wealth gap and secure a government that works for all our communities, then a national voter registration campaign to equalise voting numbers from these groups is vital.\nNot enough people know that EU citizens are eligible to vote in the upcoming London Mayoral and Assembly elections or that Commonwealth citizens are eligible to vote in all UK elections either.\nYou won’t see much from this embattled Tory government telling you this or plugging voter registration because their last hope is low turnout and disengagement. Following the Elections Act 2023, you now need to show photo ID when voting in–person. This change could see hundreds of thousands turned away from the polling station at the next General Election to solve a non-existent problem. There is a word for this: voter suppression.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_constituency-newsletter-17th-may-2024/content_474.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n17th May 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nThis week was the debate on the Palestinian family reunion scheme and the release of the Birth Trauma Report by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG). Mothers of all races but particularly Black and Brown mothers have been failed by the system. Had midwifery grown in the same capacity as the rest of the NHS, we would not be experiencing a shortage in midwives today. Instead, we are seeing huge strain on existing maternal health services, putting the lives of mothers and babies at risk. Retention of midwives is even worse with most leaving the profession to pursue other work. Midwives are overworked and underpaid and allowing conditions like these to perpetuate is only going to produce grievous outcomes for many.\nI am proud of the fact that when Russia launched its criminal invasion of Ukraine, the UK stepped up to help those fleeing from war. It therefore perplexes me that in the midst of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the unrelenting bombing campaign inflicted on the civilian population, and the recent offensive in Rafah that leaves Palestinians with no safe place to escape, that the government denies them the opportunity to seek refuge in the UK, even if they already have family here. If racism and geopolitics do not play a role, then what is the root of this apathy toward the plight of the Palestinian people? We need a Homes for Palestinians Scheme now.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn Parliament\n|\n-\nThis week, the House of Commons voted on proposals to exclude MPs from the Parliamentary estate when they come under investigation for sexual misconduct or related offences. As of 2023, there were some 56 MPs under investigation for sexual misconduct, yet all were free to come onto the parliamentary estate, where they posed a risk. I voted for an amendment to toughen this up by raising the threshold for considering exclusion from the point of charge to the point of arrest. This passed by just one vote, with a cadre of Tory MPs still voting against.\n-\nThe Criminal Justice Bill was back before MPs this week for its report stage. I supported key amendments aimed at preventing the criminalisation of rough sleeping, decriminalising women who make the deeply personal choice to have an abortion and banning the sale of “ninja swords”. It’s unjust and inhumane to subject women to multi-year police investigations and the threat of imprisonment for exercising autonomy over their bodies and reproductive health.\n-\nThis week, MPs debated the question of creating a Palestinian family reunion scheme after more than 100,000 people signed a petition calling for one. As well as pushing for an end to the killing in Gaza, the government has a duty to provide sanctuary to Palestinians with relatives in the UK. Instead of working towards this, the Home Office is rejecting claims and telling people to travel through a war zone to submit data. I raised the case of my constituent, whose family members were told to do precisely this and highlighted the fact that the government was able to establish a Homes for Ukraine Scheme in a matter of weeks. Where is the Home for Palestinians scheme?\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBirth Trauma Report Inquiry Published\n|\n|\nThis week the Birth Trauma Inquiry report by the cross-party Birth Trauma All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) was published. The Birth Trauma Inquiry is a reminder that maternity care is letting down too many women, especially those from minoritised and marginalised communities. Its findings and recommendations must be acted on without delay. I was also pleased to see this report highlighting some of the clear inequalities that Black, Asian and mixed-race mothers continue to face in maternity care. It is absolutely vital that our government sets a binding target to address the racism that negatively impacts health outcomes, as Labour has committed to do.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOpposing the Rwanda Scheme and Shock Immigration Raids\n|\n|\nLast week, I joined a rally against the government’s Rwanda Scheme and called by Stand up to Racism, Care4Calais and the TUC. Alongside Jeremy Corbyn, Daniel Kebede, and representatives of these organisations, I spoke loud and clear against the inhumane immigration policies enforced by Sunak’s Tory government. Focusing on the disturbing practice of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda and the shock detention raid operations carried out during the local elections, the rally served as a platform to raise awareness and demand change. The government should stop the raids and stop the flights. Instead of deporting people to countries with questionable human rights records, we need to expand safe routes, speed up asylum claims and let people rebuild their lives in safety.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nChristian Aid Week\n|\n|\nIt was a pleasure to attend my colleague Fleur Anderson MP’s Christian Aid Week parliamentary reception highlighting the African debt crisis. The report ‘Between life and debt’ argues that tackling global poverty will be impossible without ending the debt crisis and calls for the UK government to use its outsized role to get debts for lower-income countries cancelled. Debilitating debt repayments leave many countries unable to invest in health, education and climate resilience. Most of the bonds owed by countries eligible for G20 debt relief schemes are governed by English law. The UK government should be leading on this and ensuring private lenders cooperate on debt relief schemes.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nWalkabout in Brixton Hill Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour\n|\n|\nI was pleased to organise a walkabout with local police and Brixton Hill residents, last week to discuss anti-social behaviour in the area and what can be done. It’s important for the police to hear directly from the communities they serve. We need the police to be there when people need them, and it is essential to address the complex social causes underlying many of these issues.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStreatham Kite Festival\n|\n|\nIt was a joy to attend the official Streatham Kite Day, London’s premier kite festival last Sunday. With the sun shining and, the wind blowing, it was the perfect weather for a day full of kite flying. A big thank you and well done to the Friends of Streatham Common team, for their efforts in planning and funding this wonderful festival. Their commitment to enriching our community through events like Kite Day is truly commendable. It was fantastic to see so many of you flying kites, supporting local businesses and enjoying the live music. I look forward attending and seeing even more of you next year.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nChrist Church Drop-In\n|\n|\nIn a Year 6 Design and Technology Christ Church classroom, students were discussing sustainability and how they can create more sustainable and environmentally friendly playgrounds. As part of their social action project, they were tasked with writing to their member of Parliament (me) with their suggestions.\nTheir ideas included solar panels at school, vegetable gardens and more flower beds. As the saying goes, ‘children are the future’ and witnessing their dedication to sustainability fills me with hope for what lies ahead. I dropped off my responses to them last week. It’s always good to hear from my young constituents about their ideas and aspirations for a greener, more sustainable future.\n|\n|\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|",

I was unable to attend but sent these words of support. More information about Walk Her Home Lambeth.\nI’m sorry I can’t be there with you in person today. Sarah was my constituent and I know all of our hearts go out to her family and loved ones as we respect their request for privacy at this time.\nSarah’s kidnapping and killing at the hands of a serving police officer struck fear into the hearts of every woman in the country, but particularly women in our community. I still remember the horror I felt when news of Sarah’s disappearance first broke. So many women wrote to me in the aftermath expressing similar feelings, telling me that they had walked the exact same route that Sarah had just over a year ago and that they no longer feel safe walking in the constituency late at night.\nThis should have been a turning point in the struggle to eliminate violence against women. No one should feel afraid to walk alone in their area that they live. But for so many women in my constituency, and women across the country, the reality is they still do. And this must change.\nThis should also have been a turning point for policing. Her killer was able to perpetrate this act because of his structural and institutional power – not only as a man, but as a serving police officer abusing powers granted to him under the Coronavirus Act. And this exact same piece of legislation was used by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner of the time to forcefully disperse, kettle and arrest women holding a peaceful vigil in Clapham Common to remember Sarah and the countless other women lost to male violence.\nWe will not tackle violence against women until we address the institutional misogyny and culture of impunity among the people entrusted with prosecuting it. Women have to be able to trust the Police if the Police are going to do their job. That’s why we need a comprehensive statutory inquiry into the issue of institutional misogyny within the Met. Cressida Dick’s departure will be meaningless if she is not replaced by someone who recognises the wholesale failings within our police services and is committed to overhauling them.\nBut we also need to think outside policing if we are going to truly address the misogyny that runs right through our society. Women’s economic insecurity, leaves so many vulnerable. On current progress, the gender pay gap in London won’t close until 2172, some 3 million women are in low-paid work, compared with 1.9 million men and women disproportionately suffer from government decisions to cut Universal Credit.\nEducation is equally important. In a recent survey, half of school pupils reported receiving no sex education during lockdown, whilst exposure to misogyny online increased. We need to do so much more to ensure that our children are learning the right lessons about care and consent, and that young men and boys in particular are not learning the wrong ones from our wider culture.\nAnd as I also said in Parliament this week, a government that is serious about tackling violence against all women and girls, would reverse cuts to survivor-centred services.\nSo today as our thoughts turn to Sarah and and all those women have lost their lives to male violence, its crucial that we renew our demand for social, economic and political change. And that we renew our resolve to keep fighting for a world where women can live free from the threat of male violence.",

They’re very reliant on computer technology to do this, which is proving to be a problem in the local area.\n“I’ve been contacted by one school in particular that’s raised this problem, pointing out that many of their pupils don’t have the necessary hardware to access their remote learning systems.”\n“According to campaign group Stop School Cuts, schools in Streatham saw average funding reductions of £688 per pupil between 2010 and 2019. After ten years of constant cuts, it’s not surprising many schools don’t have the means to meet their children’s educational needs.\n“As coronavirus constrains household finances, this is compounded by the rising household poverty in our area too. Data from End Child Poverty shows that after taking housing costs into account, 39% of children in Streatham live in poverty, meaning households can’t afford to buy the technology themselves at the best of times.\n“Children without access to remote learning technology are another group who are really falling through the gaps in our social safety net.\n“I’m calling on Streatham businesses and residents with any spare laptops, iPads, and tablets, to donate these to someone who really needs it. As we’ve seen again and again, it’s those with the least who are feeling the effects of this crisis the most and your donations could make a small difference by helping a local child keep up with their work.”\nEnds\nNotes\n- ‘Unions publish school funding constituency league table to sway voters’, Schools Week (09 November 2019), https://schoolsweek.co.uk/union-publishes-constituencies-league-table-for-school-funding-to-sway-voters/\n- End Child Poverty’s 2019 Regional Estimates for Parliamentary Constituencies in London: http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Regional-Estimates-PCon-London-with-summary-1.xlsx\nFor further information about this press release, please contact Ollie Collard, Communications Officer, Office of the Shadow Immigration Officer, Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP at oliver.collard@parliament.uk or on 07918110617.",

This offers further confirmation (if you needed it) that the Government is lurching towards a disastrous No-Deal Brexit which breaches international law, threatens the union and lowers the UK’s global standing. At a time of economic recession, mass redundancy and public health crisis, it paves the way for a monumental act of self-destruction which will leave people in Streatham and across the UK worse-off.\nBy overriding the Withdrawal Agreement, the Government has undermined what little integrity it had left, throwing their own trustworthiness into serious doubt. Breaking an international treaty in this way is unacceptable. It can’t be one rule for our Government and another for the rest of the world. This also weakens our chances of securing favourable trade deals in future. If we’re willing to break international law when it suits us, this is hardly the basis for favourable trade deals with other countries when the transition period ends.\nThis Bill also drives a further wedge between our Government and the devolved administrations, jeopardising the Good Friday Agreement and infringing the devolution settlement. Developing such important legislation without the collaboration, co-operation and above all, consent, of the devolved administrations, is the exact opposite of what a truly unionist government would do.\nAs usual, the Tories are playing with the future of everyone in the UK and the stakes could not be higher. Even before the current crisis the Government’s own worst-case scenario predicted food, medicine and fuel shortages, as well as price hikes on everyday items. If they cared, they wouldn’t be risking this during an ongoing pandemic, a growing jobs crisis and the worst recession in history. You don’t dig yourself out of a hole by digging even deeper.\nThis is a new low even by the standards of this Government, which has brought forward some already shocking legislation.",

With the Government currently making a 60% profit on application fees, it’s clear there is some room to improve this situation and stop this from happening, whether by reducing these fees, or even getting rid of citizenship fees altogether for people born to UK parents abroad or those raised in the UK.\nWhen I met with Lambeth Citizens in the General Election of 2019, we discussed the issue of citizenship fees and I promised to raise this in Parliament.

Only a radical Green New Deal with a net zero carbon emission target of 2030 will address the two great crises of our time.\n“If we’re serious about delivering ecological and economic recovery post-Covid, climate action needs to be at the heart of everything we do.

Yet week after week, when asked to explain why public services are broken, why workers are striking, or why people can’t make ends meet, our millionaire prime minister reaches for the scapegoat button instead. His shameful dig at trans people on Wednesday, even as the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey looked on, was beneath contempt. No amount of blaming minoritised social groups for his party’s policies will fix the ruin inflicted by fourteen years of Tory governments. The sooner we get the Tories out of government the better.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn Parliament\n|\n-\nLabour hosted two Opposition Day Debates this week. The first of these focused on the need to ban zombie knives and review online knife sales. This motion passed without the need for a vote. There is urgent need for a similar consensus on rebuilding the social supports that make communities and young people safer. The second focused on reforming ministerial severance pay. Departing Tory ministers collected almost £1m in severance payments last year, many of them resigning amid the collapse of the Truss government or after being implicated in serious misconduct. Labour tabled a motion to end these golden goodbyes for misconduct, breaches of the ministerial code and incompetence in government.\n-\nOn Thursday, MPs debated managerial culture at the Post Office. In the wake of the Horizon scandal, attention is rightly focused on the culture of secrecy and confidentiality, which led to one of the largest miscarriages of justice in our country’s history. The proposed closure of Clapham Common Post Office shows this is an ongoing issue. Despite receiving thousands of objections and petition signatures opposing the loss of this busy branch, the Post Office has decided to steam ahead with these plans. Whilst they won’t admit it, it seems that the main reason this closure is going ahead is to cut costs as executives scrabble around to save costs. As the mismanagement continues, the local community is coming tomorrow morning for a march along Clapham High Street to save our post office. Join us from 10:30am outside Clapham High Street Station.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAn Update on the Clapham Chemical Attack\n|\nOne week on, Police are now treating last week’s appalling chemical attack as an attempted murder, motivated by relationship breakdown. In an update issued earlier this evening, they stated that they now believe the suspect to be dead. The woman who was attacked remains in a critical condition and is still too unwell to talk to the police. A fundraiser has been set up by her close family friends. Please consider supporting and sharing as this family looks to recover and rebuild their lives.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nChairing the APPG on Endometriosis\n|\n|\nIt was great to chair the Endometriosis APPG meeting which featured a fantastic presentation from the Endometriosis Foundation. There are 1.5 million women in the UK living with endometriosis. Women with this condition experience pain on a daily basis but often wait years for a diagnosis. This week, we heard the thought-provoking statistic that 1 in every 5 social media mentions of endometriosis concern fertility, which is something this condition can significantly impact. The choice to freeze your eggs as a person with endometriosis is next to none on the NHS. Meanwhile, treatments for erectile dysfunction for 75+ year olds for almost 10 times the price are readily available. We need better resourcing for high-quality endometrisis treatment. Personalised plans for endometriosis need to be the norm, not the exception.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGiving HIV the Finger: Testing for National HIV Testing Week\n|\n|\nThis week marked National HIV Testing Week. To mark the occasion, I took a test in Parliament with the Terrence Higgins Trust. Getting tested for HIV is something I do every year. It’s quick, easy and painless. Anyone can be affected by HIV and it’s so important for everyone to test regularly. If you have HIV, finding out means you can start treatment, stay healthy, and avoid passing the virus onto anyone else. Anyone diagnosed with HIV in the UK can access free treatment and support on the NHS.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLambeth Civic Awards\n|\n|\nCongratulations to all the finalists and winners of this week’s Lambeth Civic Awards, which took place on Wednesday evening. It’s so important to celebrate and recognise all the people and organisations working to make our area a better place to live.

Nearly two million people are at risk of losing their voice as a consequence of this change. The latest figures reveal that just 50,000 people have applied for the Government’s free form of photo ID so far. Introducing mandatory voter ID was always a shameless effort to try and buy an advantage at the next election at a cost of £180 million to the public. All the signs so far suggest it is working exactly as the Tories intended.\nThe principle of universal suffrage is a baseline of any democratic system. Sadly, we now have a Government which is undermining this principle, picking and choosing whose voices are heard. All the evidence suggested that bringing in compulsory photo ID for elections would pose substantial barriers to lower income voters, people of colour, trans people and the young in particular. The government’s final list of acceptable IDs notably excludes several forms of ID freely available to young people.\nIf democracy is going to work for everyone, it has to include everyone. We should be working to expand participation among under-represented groups in our political system and exploring ways to increase turnout: whether it’s extending the vote to younger people, automatic voter registration, or same day voting. Voter suppression from governments is always a sign of fear and weakness. It shows a lack of confidence that their policies can win over a genuine majority of the country. One excuse the Government parrots is the idea of “countering fraud”. Just one person was cautioned for electoral fraud last year. The idea that one case of voter personation is a bigger issue than millions being deprived of a voice is a joke.\nPeople have confidence in the integrity of our electoral system. They don’t have confidence in the integrity of this Government. That’s the real reason we’re seeing this attack on the right to vote. Just last week, we saw a Tory MP caught in a Times sting offering to do a gambling company’s bidding. This is symptomatic of a party which draws its funding from Russian businesspeople, property developers, private healthcare companies, fossil fuel producers and gambling lobbyists then makes policies that benefits these firms at everyone else’s expense.\nIn democracies, politicians do not choose their voters, voters choose their politicians.

If they stand true to the apology that they made years ago, they must take stock of these criticisms, remove the Windrush compensation scheme from the Home Office so it can be managed properly, listen to the Windrush generation about where they would like to have their memorial, and take active steps to acknowledge institutional racism in the immigration system and across society.\nRead more about what I got up to on Windrush Day",

Last year, BT posted profits of £1.3 billion, paid out £700 million to shareholders, and gave their CEO a 32% pay rise. But the best they could offer BT workers this year was a real terms pay cut. Is it really surprising that workers at the company voted overwhelmingly for strike action? After a decade in which people have seen their pay packets fall in real terms, it’s heartening to see people getting organised to demand better.\nWhile workers are fighting for their livelihoods, Boris Johnson continues to fight fires in Downing Street. His refusal to even investigate the multiple counts of sexual misconduct levelled at a close senior MP should have been surprising. But it’s not anymore because this Government has not just tolerated these kind of disgusting abuses of power but have sought to make them the new normal. They’re not sorry it happened; they’re just sorry it became a story.\n|\n|\n|\nIn Parliament\nI had a busy time in Parliament this week, challenging the Government on: attempts to rip up an international treaty, another inhumane deportation flight, systematically failing London on policing and the enduring injustice of the Windrush scandal.\nStop Tearing Communities and Families Apart\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday, I had the chance to question Dominic Raab about the Government’s latest mass deportation flight to Ghana and Nigeria as he deputised at Prime Minister’s Questions. The people onboard this flight included mothers, grandmothers, and an LGBT+ asylum seeker. They are not, as the Deputy Prime Minister insinuated in his answer, dangerous criminals. I will continue to challenge these flights, which tear communities and families apart and fly in the face of human rights and equalities law.\n|\n|\nOpposing Another Illegal Bill from the Government\n|\n|\nThe Government’s illegal Bill to rip up the Northern Ireland Protocol represents another breach of international law, threatening peace in Northern Ireland, bringing more economic disruption and undermining future trade deals. They know full well that the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted against Brexit, by a much bigger margin than the Vote Leave campaign achieved, and they continue to elect a large majority of MPs and MLAs who oppose Brexit and support the protocol—but then this Government and their predecessors have never been over-concerned with democracy in Ireland. I spoke and voted against this Bill on Monday.\n|\n|\nThe Government are Failing Londoners on Policing\n|\n|\nThis week saw the Metropolitan Police placed in special measures for the first time in its history. In the wake of Sarah Everard’s murder, the illegal strip search of Child Q, and a string of other abuses, confidence in the Met is at an all-time low. These issues are particularly pronounced in our own borough, where Sarah’s killing last year and attempts from the Met’s top brass to shut down a vigil in its aftermath were acutely felt and where we continue to see high levels of disproportionality in policing. On Wednesday, I asked the Policing Minister when the Government are going to take responsibility for this and push through the changes Londoners are calling for: from more community policing to reviewing the overuse of stop and search..\n|\n|\nReflecting on the Windrush Scandal: No Lessons Learned\n|\n|\nI also took part in my colleague Kate Osamor MP’s Westminster Hall Debate on the Windrush Lessons Learned Review. Eighteen months after this report, it’s important to hold the Government to account for their failures to follow through on their commitments to act on its findings and recommendations. If the Government really wanted to address the injustices of the Windrush scandal, they would move beyond empty commitments and gesture politics by making the compensation scheme independent and dismantling the Hostile Environment.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGranton School Primary Fair\n|\n|\nA big thank you to teachers and parents at Granton Primary for their warm welcome to their fantastic summer fair last weekend. It was great to see the local community coming together with some lovely singing from the school choir. Congratulations to everyone on a very successful event to raise funds for the school.\n|\n|\nMeeting with St Martin’s Estate Residents\n|\n|\nOn Thursday evening, I had the opportunity to meet with the St Martin’s Tenants and Residents Association (TRA) to discuss ongoing compensation claims. I’ve been campaigning alongside residents on the estate for proper compensation after their lift was left broken for months. They shared further stories of disrepair and issues with water charges and service charge transparency more generally. I’m currently looking into these issues and will be writing to their housing association about the compensation process again.\n|\n|\nVisiting Temporary Accommodation at Stanthorpe Hotel\n|\n|\nWith more than 36,000 people on the social housing waiting list in Lambeth, it’s important to ensure we have the highest standards in our temporary accommodation. On Thursday morning, I joined our St Leonard’s Councillors to inspect temporary accommodation at the Stanthorpe Hotel, where residents have raised issues about conditions. During our visit, we observed reasonable standards of hygiene but cramped conditions, ongoing damp issues and lack of access to outside space. The building is clearly in need of refurbishment and there are also concerns about how much value for money the contractor is currently providing. I’ll be taking this issue forwards.\n|\n|\nMeeting with Serco Refuse Loaders\n|\nWhen Serco took over Lambeth’s Waste Management contract last year there were concerns due to Serco’s poor history with running other contracts – in particular, their asylum accommodation contracts with the Home Office. In a recent meeting with local refuse collectors, workers told me of the awful experiences they had: not being supplied with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), being told to glue boots together, and having to wear their own clothes while collecting waste.\nThey also talked about issues relating to pay disputes and changes to refuse teams that have resulted in some serious health and safety risks. I will be writing to Serco regarding these issues and have demanded that they take urgent action to rectify the situation. If things don’t improve for workers then I will be calling on Lambeth Council to withdraw their Waste Management contract.\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

This will come as a massive relief to everyone who relies on the service. Losing this route to Tory cuts would have made it harder for our community to access affordable, sustainable transport. Thank you to everyone who campaigned for this alongside me to protect local bus routes and prevent these cuts.\nAhead of this decision, I wrote to the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, reiterating my call to protect the route. The Tories’ failure to cover TfL’s lost Covid revenues has left London’s bus network facing major cuts. As a constituency without a tube station, I know cuts presented a real worry for many residents. All the evidence shows that losing bus services disproportionately impacts people on low incomes, people from Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds, disabled people and pregnant women.\nAt a time when we should be encouraging more people onto public transport. The Tories’ refusal to agree a fair funding deal for TfL after Covid decimated its finances, leaving our city facing the loss of 4 per cent of our bus network. Contrast this settlement with the no strings bailouts dished out to failing privatised rail franchises. Talk about rewarding failure.",

But the racism many of us face today have their roots in empire and reparations needs to start with simple things like fairer trade, returning stolen artefacts, and cancelling debts that have been repaid over and over. The fact that the Cambridge Union voted overwhelmingly in favour of this shows that the tide is turning and the call for reparations is only getting louder.\nYou can watch the debate below.",

A family have lost a mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother and we send our sincerest condolences to those who loved her most. May she rest in peace.\nAs the elected representative of Streatham, I attended the Presentation of Addresses by both Houses to His Majesty King Charles III, joined my Lambeth parliamentary colleagues in Windrush Square for the proclamation of King Charles III and signed the book of condolence for the late Queen Elizabeth II at Lambeth Town Hall.\n|\n|\nI also joined Lambeth Mayor Pauline George, Deputy Lambeth Lieutenant Christopher Wellbelove and Councillor Jim Dickson at Uplands Care Home on their tour across the borough to enable elderly and immobile residents to sign the book of condolence. It was great to speak to residents and say thank you to staff for all they do.\n|\n|\nPushing for Answers on the Fatal Police Shooting\n|\n|\nThe fatal police shooting of Chris Kaba in Streatham Hill has sent shockwaves through our community. At 24 years old, Chris was studying for an architecture apprenticeship, engaged to be married and on the cusp of becoming a father. It is right that there is now a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances that led to Chris’s premature death. But the facts so far raise difficult questions for the police, questions that we must continue to ask.\nSince the shooting, I have had close contact with Chris’s family. It’s vital that we honour their wishes and follow their lead. I’ve been out demonstrating with the Kaba family outside Scotland Yard and joined them for a quiet vigil held in remembrance of Chris at the site on Kirkstall Gardens where his life was cut short. I’ll be with them every step of the way as they fight for accountability.\n|\n|\nI’ve also attended various meetings with the Met Police and the IOPC (Independent Office of Police Conduct), where I have pushed for answers. So far, campaigning has led to the suspension of the officer involved, the eventual escalation to a homicide case, permission for the family to view the footage and – in a first – an examination of whether or not Chris’s race played a part in his shooting.\nAs the situation evolves, the family is asking for:\n- Clarity on whether police were specifically following Chris on the night they shot him.\n- The individual who fired the shot to be interviewed under caution without further delay.\n- A charging decision from the IOPC in a matter of weeks, not months.\nNobody deserves to die in the way that Chris died. No family should have to go through the pain his loved ones have endured over the last three weeks. After viewing the bodycam footage this week, the family have taken a step back from the case but it has only renewed their\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMini Budget – A Massive Boost for the 1%\n|\n|\nOn Friday, the new Chancellor announced the Government’s response to the cost of living emergency. This was a budget for the super rich, which will do nothing to address the crisis of falling living standards faced by the majority of people in this country. If your income is below £155,000, you lose out. If your income is above £155,000, you gain.\nThis was literally a budget for the 1%, which promised to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses, slash taxes for corporations and the rich, introduce new benefit cuts and launch further attacks on trade unions. Meanwhile, there was nothing to insulate homes or help people reduce consumption for the long run. Nothing to shield renters from astronomical rent hikes. Nothing to support the very poorest in our society.\nWhile people everywhere worry about how they are going to afford energy bills, rising rents and food, the Government is handing more money back to the individuals and corporations already making huge profits off these basic needs via swingeing tax cuts.\nThe Tories have taken a big gamble that cutting taxes for the rich will deliver a mini boom for their political and donor bases to get them over the line at the next election. Whatever happens next, it’s clearly not going to help the overwhelming majority of people in this country.\nAfter twelve years of sluggish growth and vicious inequality, they’re doubling down on the same failed policies and short-term thinking. And they’re running out of rope.\n|\n|\nLambeth Solidarity Launch\n|\n|\nI was proud to speak to a packed-out Lambeth Solidarity launch meeting at the start of the month. It’s not a cost of living crisis; it’s a cost of living scandal, created by twelve years of Tory policy choices and an ongoing refusal to address rampant inequalities. Twelve years of the Tories has meant twelve years of falling pay, tax cuts and ringfenced profits for the rich, and of course, the absolute decimation of our public services.\nWith Truss offering only to reheat the same policies that got the country into the mess we find ourselves in, the fightback starts at the grassroots. Across the country, people are turning anger into action by coming together and getting organised to fight for the basics for everyone in our community: proper pay, affordable bills, decent housing and enough to eat.\n|\n|\nStanding with Postal Workers\n|\n|\nI was out on rock solid picket lines at Streatham and Brixton delivery offices with CWU members at the start of September. 115,000 postal workers across the UK are on strike because Royal Mail is imposing a real terms pay cut on their workers even as they record huge profits and dividend pay-outs. Last year, they posted profits of £758 million and paying shareholders £400 million.

I’m looking forwards to reading up more on Streatham’s rich chess history!\n|\n|\nOpposing Rwanda Deportation Plans\n|\n|\nAs Parliament returned, it was great to see so many people demonstrating outside the Royal Courts of Justice to stop Rwanda deportations. As twelve years of Tory policy comes back to bite us, the Government has defaulted to demonising refugees and migrants and trying to roll back hard-won rights. These deportation plans are nothing more than state-sanctioned people trafficking. We must keep exposing the latest assault on refugees for what it is: an attempt to divide and distract us.\n|\n|\nStanding up for the Right to Safe Abortion\n|\n|\nAt the start of September, I marched to defend the right to safe abortions. Abortion is a form of healthcare. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court rolling back reproductive rights, it’s so important to stand in solidarity and put pressure on our Government to do the same on the international stage. We know there are people in the Tory Party who think that we should have a debate about whether or not women keep control over their own bodies. The Government’s recent decision to excise all reference to “sexual and reproductive health and rights” and “bodily autonomy” in an international statement on freedom of religion or belief and gender equality suggests these kind of views are winning traction.\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

This was the subject of a Westminster Hall debate on arms sales to Israel, secured by Zarah Sultana MP, on the following day. I pointed out that this means the UK is not just complicit in the killing of civilians in Gaza but also in the ongoing occupation of the West Bank. We should follow past precedent and suspend arms sales to Israel and any other country that is violating international law and human rights.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_train-ticket-office-consultations/content_552.html": "With the rail industry eager to rush this through, the consultation on these changes is already up and running and Wednesday 26th July is the deadline to get your comments in. If you have not done so already, I would urge you to have your say by emailing London TravelWatch and encourage others to do so. The more objections we submit, the more pressure there will be on the Government to reconsider these proposals and the more ammunition we have to push back against them. You’ll find more information about how to submit over on the TravelWatch website and there is a template letter you can use over at the Transport for All campaign website.\nClosing station ticket offices is a cost-cutting exercise that puts profits before passengers. With rail fares rising at twice the rate of wages since 2010, we are paying more and more for less and less of a service.\nOur train station ticket offices are so much more than a place to purchase tickets, acting as a central point of contact for customers who may otherwise struggle to locate staff, supporting passengers who cannot use machines, providing a place of safety for children separated from parents, and offering ticketing advice to give people maximum savings and prevent mis-booked tickets.\nDisability charities are vocally opposing these changes, which would further impede disabled people’s right to accessible travel. Transport for All, which runs the #NotJustTheTicket campaign, is backed by over a dozen charities supporting deaf people, people with visual impairment or blindness and other disabled people in opposing these closures. They rightly point out that train station ticket offices and ticket office staff are the first point of contact for disabled passengers seeking assisted travel.\nThe Government claims it is simply a matter of moving staff from out behind the glass into the main station. But train operators have reportedly issued Section 188 notices to inform staff that their jobs are at risk and the government is refusing to offer any guarantees that jobs will be protected. With train companies already frequently failing to deliver assisted travel, it is very difficult to see how further cuts to staffing would improve accessibility – quite the opposite.\nIf you haven’t already, I’d also encourage you to sign my petition to stop local ticket office closures and share this in your local networks. Let’s save Streatham’s station ticket offices and keep our railways safe and accessible for everyone who travels on them.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_18th-november-2023/content_516.html": "In the run-up to this week’s vote, my inbox was inundated with constituents writing to highlight the killing of innocent Palestinians in Gaza and urge me to back a ceasefire. In the best part of four years in Parliament, I have never received so much correspondence on an issue. I voted in favour of backing an immediate ceasefire, as I have consistently called for elsewhere. This is the best way to protect the lives of innocent Palestinian civilians under bombardment, secure the release of Israeli hostages and get desperately needed aid into Gaza.\nThis week’s vote was about recognising our common humanity and taking a clear stand against the killing and collective punishment of innocent people. Most of the 11,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza so far have been women and children. To put the scale of the current bombardment into perspective, Save the Children have reported that more Palestinian children were killed in the first three weeks of this conflict than were killed in the entirety of global conflicts last year.\nThe killing of civilians is morally indefensible. Allowing it to go unchallenged is unforgiveable. Yet this is precisely what has happened, with civilians paying the ultimate price for the failures of US, UK and European political leaders to call for peace and call out violations of international law.\nIt must also be restated that an enduring peace will not be achieved without addressing the root causes of the current violence. That means holding all parties responsible for violations of international law, recognising a Palestinian state and working towards a diplomatic solution based on mutual respect and equal rights for Israelis and Palestinians.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_backing-a-ceasefire-isnt-about-party-politics-its-about-common-humanity/content_47.html": "Last night, a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza was voted down. Of the 15 countries that make up this body, 13 voted in favour. The two holdouts? The UK (abstained) and the USA (vetoed).\nThe current war on Gaza has been carried out with licence from American, British and European political leaders. Across the world, millions have protested for an end to the fighting and for the safe release of the hostages. World leaders are increasingly at odds with public opinion.\nThe military offensive mounted in response to the appalling terror attacks of 7 October has been one of the most devastating of the 21st century so far. It has levelled the majority of Gaza’s homes, displaced millions, cut off essential foodstuffs and medicines, shut down most of Gaza’s hospital capacity, claimed as many as 29,000 lives and has left many more with life-changing injuries and trauma.\nIn a war that has spawned a new acronym, “WCNSF”(wounded child with no surviving family), the main casualties have been women and children. With no functioning maternal hospitals, pregnant women are having caesarean sections without anaesthetic, water or soap. Despite last month’s landmark International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling, these horrors continue.\nThe history of this conflict did not begin with the horrific attack on 7 October. Britain was the former colonial power that laid the foundations for the mass displacement of Palestinians – and the conflict today. From the Sykes-Picot Agreement to the Balfour Declaration, the betrayals of McMahon, and the invasion of Allenby’s forces, our country’s imperial past created the contours of the current conflict. We have a unique responsibility to push for peace.\nRecent history also makes it incumbent on us to act, with £472 million worth of military exports shipped to Israel since 2015. The time to suspend arms sales is long overdue, and if we do not, we are complicit in this onslaught.\nSo far, the assault on Gaza has done nothing to make the region safer and has failed to free all the hostages – its original justification. After Israel’s embattled far-right prime minister dismissed a ceasefire deal for the return of all hostages, freed hostage Adina Moshe told him that if the offensive continues, “there won’t be any hostages to release”. Israel has subsequently confirmed that 31 of the remaining 136 hostages are dead, with the fate of 20 more uncertain. We cannot gamble with their lives; we must secure their safe return.\nLabour is now calling for the fighting to stop, opposing any invasion of Rafah, and expressing clear support for Palestinian statehood. This is significant. For too long, the British government has dangled the latter as a prospect at the end of peace negotiations, instead of a pre-requisite for meaningful ones.\nSince November’s vote, over 17,000 more Palestinians have been killed. 1.4 million people have been forced into Rafah in recent months, leaving the city more densely populated than Paris or Mumbai. A full-on offensive here could mark the deadliest phase yet.\nAs we debate and wring our hands over wording and nuance, thousands of children are being killed and maimed. The average age of a child killed is just five. Every country has the right to defend itself and Hamas should be brought to task for their crimes. But what threat does a five-year-old pose? This is collective punishment.\nThat’s why I’ll be voting for an immediate and permanent ceasefire again today. Supporting the push for a ceasefire isn’t a matter of party politics, it’s about recognising our common humanity. MPs of all parties need to come together and send a clear message to the world. Only by building this diplomatic pressure can we hope to bring an end to the fighting and work towards peace.\nThis article was first published in the Independent on the 21st February 2024.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_25th-june-newsletter/content_647.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n24th June 2022\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nYesterday marked a dark day for women’s reproductive rights, with the right-wing dominated US Supreme Court overturning Roe vs Wade. Taking the right to an abortion away does not end abortions; just safe ones. Solidarity with our sisters in America fighting for their rights in the face of right-wing ideologues. Ending the right to safe abortions is an attack on all women but women with the least resources will suffer most. In the USA, the poorest 12% of women account for almost 50% of abortions and the poorest 30% for 75% of abortions.\nThis decision is an important reminder that we can never take the social gains we have made for granted. With a Government that is determined to roll back so many rights and had to be wrestled into keeping telemedical abortion care earlier this year, we must remain vigilant here too.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn and around Streatham\nSupporting Workers\n|\n|\nI was proud to march alongside thousands of people from across the trade union movement this weekend to demand a pay rise for Britain, a better deal in workplaces, and action to address the financial turmoil now facing the country under this Tory Government. Rents are up 15.7% in London on last year, FTSE350 profits are up 75%, CEO pay is up 29% and city bonuses are up 20%. The reason people are struggling is because we have unrestrained profiteering from landlords, corporations, bosses and bankers whilst the Government tells workers they have to take another real terms pay cut after a decade of the same.\n|\n|\nI was also on the picket line at Waterloo with rail workers this week, who are taking strike action to defend their pay, jobs and conditions. I was proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with RMT Union members going on strike to make their voices heard and ensure that workers aren’t left picking up the tab for the financial turmoil now facing our country after twelve years of Tory Government.\nTrain companies still raked in £500 million in profits last year – enough to give a £12,500 pay rise to every single rail worker going on strike this week. The only people taking a pay cut should be the profiteers driving up inflation.\nInstead of listening to people exercising their democratic rights to try and get a fair deal for workers, the Tories are using everything at their disposal to attack them, bringing in new legislation that undermines the right to strike and introducing new strike-breaking laws. I’ll be standing up for them and defend the right to strike if we’re going to build a society that works for workers, not the wealthy.\n|\n|\nProtect our Public Transport\n|\n|\nEven as the Government denounces striking rail workers for causing travel disruption this week, they are forcing TfL to cut the equivalent of an entire tube line and 20% of London’s buses. The only people who want to make it more difficult to get around London on public transport are the Tories.\nAs a constituency without a tube station, I know bus cuts are a real worry for many residents. Streatham buses under threat of being rerouted (59 & 133) or axed altogether (45), I’ll keep fighting for a fair deal for London’s public transport. The Tories must stop swinging the axe at our transport infrastructure.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nListen to Londoners on Policing\n|\n|\nThis week, I’ve written to the Government to highlight concerns about the independence and impartiality of their review into Cressida Dick’s resignation. Lambeth has the lowest expressed level of confidence in the Metropolitan Police of any London borough in the wake of a string of policing scandals. Another whitewash will do nothing to rebuild shattered confidence in London’s policing and make our city safer for all our communities. Instead of trying to impose their will on the people of London and pitting the police against people, the Government should listen to Londoners, giving us a say in the appointment of our next Commissioner.\n|\n|\nJustice for the Windrush Generation\n|\n|\nOn Windrush Day we celebrate the generation of people who came from every corner of the Commonwealth to help rebuild Britain after the Second World War. We must never forget their huge contribution or the racism they suffered at the hands of successive governments. This week, I tabled an EDM celebrating 74 years since the Empire Windrush docked at Tillbury.\nIf the Government really meant their repeated pledges of justice, they would have fixed the compensation scheme, ended the hostile environment and set out a wholesale approach to restorative justice. Without this, the Government’s £1m Windrush Statue, built without fully consulting the Windrush community, is just a monument to their ongoing failure to acknowledge and act on their trauma.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nHelping People Reach Safety in the UK\n|\n|\nThe Home Office has been delaying visas for Ukrainian babies and children despite approving their parents’, including families being sponsored by my constituents. You could be forgiven for thinking this was a cynical attempt to issue visas whilst ensuring people couldn’t actually come here. Whatever the root cause, it has put families and young people in harm’s way and needs to stop.\nThe Government’s failure to support people fleeing war in Ukraine is inseparable from their determination to deny refugees their rights. Instead of issuing visas to select groups of refugees, they should dismantle the Hostile Environment, open safe routes and give people a chance to rebuild their lives in safety.\n|\n|\nEnding the Care to Prison Pipeline\n|\n|\nLess than 1% of people grow up in care but care leavers make up 25% of the UK prison population and 33% of the UK homeless population respectively. I was proud to join children’s charity Become this week to discuss how we can address the failures in our care system and champion care leavers in Parliament.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPushing for Nuclear Disarmament\n|\n|\nI started the week in Vienna, attending the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons conference. This Treaty has been signed by hundreds of countries but not the UK Government, who haven’t even shown up and are stockpiling more nukes instead of pursuing nuclear disarmament. It is an affront to human life that at a time when we are facing the challenges of a global pandemic, rising global poverty and a climate catastrophe, the Tories pouring yet more money into destructive nuclear technology. With this treaty, it now have an international ban on nuclear weapons. The next step is to enforce it.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

Energy bills in France are rising by just 4%. The difference? The French people own their energy company. In Germany, a new public transport ticket will cost people just €9 (£7.70) a month.\nWhile countries that own their energy and transport systems are using this money to really keep costs down, our Government has finally been forced into offering people additional help this week. Their plan falls way short of what these other countries are doing: a windfall tax that barely touches excess profits. It’s giving with one hand and taking with the other. And instead of recognising that our dependence on oil and gas is part of the problem, the Government is funnelling investment straight into them, coming alongside tax reliefs that will help oil and gas companies swerve some of the tax increases.\nBut as I said on Politics London last weekend, if energy companies are raking in massive profits from consumers year on year, that’s not just an argument for windfall taxes. It’s an argument to take energy into public ownership and use the money we pay shareholders to cut bills and invest in renewables instead.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn Parliament\nPublic Order Bill: Defending our Right to Call for Change\n|\n|\nOn Monday, Parliament debated the first Bill of the new session. Faced with a crisis of escalating living costs, what’s the Government’s top priority for the coming months? Making it harder for people to protest. I’m sure that has nothing to do with the sheer scale of opposition that their response to the cost of living crisis is likely to generate. I voted against their Public Order Bill and also tabled a reasoned amendment to throw it out. Our country’s strong tradition of dissent is the reason we have the rights and freedoms we all enjoy today. But we have a Government that’s determined to entrench the power of the very wealthiest in our society and crack down on anyone who raises their voice in opposition to this.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBlack Maternal Health: Learning from Lived Experiences\n|\n|\nBlack women are four times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth. When the Government is asked take action on this, they often claim they don’t have enough data. This week, campaign organisation Five X More (who form the Secretariat of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Black Maternal Health) have released their own survey of 1,300 Black women’s experiences of UK maternity care. I was honoured to give a keynote speech at the Royal College of Nursing but as I told the audience, it can’t be right that we have to re-live our trauma just to be listened to. With fully 43% of the women surveyed reporting facing discrimination in maternity care, the evidence of institutional racism is there for the Government to see. Now they need to act.\nMake Ethnicity Pay Gap Reporting Mandatory\n|\n|\nYour salary shouldn’t be limited by your gender, the colour of your skin or your disability. But how can you call out unequal pay if you don’t know what your colleagues earn? On Tuesday, I hosted a parliamentary drop-in with UNISON on mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting. The Government must introduce mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting to ensure equal work for equal pay – as recommended in our recent (cross-party) Women and Equalities Select Committee Report into the issue.\nChild Citizenship Fees\n|\n|\nMoving my amendment last year.\n|\nIn a big win for the campaigners fighting to ensure no child is priced out of citizenship, the Government has been forced to waive the £1,012 child citizenship fee for children in state care and children whose families who can’t afford it. As recently as December, Tory MPs jeered my amendment to the Nationality & Borders Act last December that would have waived fees for children in care & cut fees to cost price. Now the Government is adapting them as policy. But with the Government currently charging £596 over the odds on every single application, we need to keep fighting to cut this fee to admin costs and make sure nobody is paying over the odds just to take up their right to citizenship.\n|\n|\nCovid Memorial Quilt\n|\n|\nI stopped by the Covid Memorial Quilt in Parliament on Wednesday to see how it’s coming along. Launched by my colleague Dawn Butler, this quilt is a tapestry of stories from constituencies up and down the country. Streatham’s beautiful entry, from the South London Refugee Association, is a call for an end to No Recourse to Public Funds, which left people from migrant communities destitute during the pandemic and left to rely on charity and a postcode lottery.\n|\n|\n|\nIn and around Streatham\nBringing Better Transport to Streatham\n|\n|\nI was very happy to be on Politics London this weekend, discussing the cost of living crisis, dental care, and transport in South London. There’s a North-South divide when it comes to London’s transport. If they’re going to fix this, the Government needs to stop punishing TfL for being publicly owned, devolve rail services and agree a long-term funding settlement for TfL to improve infrastructure in Streatham and across South London.\nBack in Town Hall\n|\n|\nOn Wednesday, I joined my Lambeth Labour colleagues Florence Eshalomi MP and Helen Hayes MP at Lambeth Town Hall for the first full council meeting since the local elections. I’d like to thank Councillor Annie Gallop for her service to our community over the last year and congratulate our newly elected Mayor Pauline George, the first British Nigerian woman to represent our borough, who will make an outstanding ambassador for our community.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nCatching up with Local Teachers\n|\n|\nOn a visit to Iqra Primary School last year\n|\nOn Monday, I joined my constituency neighbour Florence Eshalomi MP to meet with a local delegation of education trade unionists to discuss questions of school funding and teachers’ pay. Our schools are currently facing the consequences of years of austerity, compounded by the impact of Covid on education. Teacher pay is about 20% less than it would be if it was linked to inflation. From 2010-2019, the average classroom teacher and teaching assistant saw real terms pay cuts of £4,400 and £4,000 respectively.\nLike many, teachers and support staff are finding escalating living costs unmanageable, particularly in London. We have a recruitment and retention crisis in the profession with 30% of teachers leaving within the first five years. I’m committed to working with teachers and their unions to ensure our schools are properly funded and our teachers are properly paid and supported.\nJubilee Celebrations at Henry Cavendish Primary\n|\n|\nOn Thursday, I joined our new Lambeth Mayor Pauline George and students at Henry Cavendish Primary this week for their Jubilee celebrations, where we handed out prizes for their fantastic celebratory models and letters to the Queen. It was also a lot of fun being interviewed for their school radio station about my journey into politics and how I’ll be celebrating the Jubilee bank holiday.\nStanding up for Residents Facing Substandard Housing\n|\n|\nPeople living at St Giles House who’ve been dealing with a number of issues lately. An elderly resident recently had her bag stolen outside the front door of the building, losing her front door key and key fob to access the building in the process. When following up on this, I was made aware of several other issues that their provider, Sanctuary Housing, had failed to address – including a serious leak that had been going on since before Christmas.\nI organised a meeting between St Giles’ House residents and the Regional Director of Sanctuary housing so residents could tell their provider about some of the issues they’ve been experiencing first-hand, which took place on Friday. I’m pleased to say that Sanctuary, their housing provider, has made several improvements as a result of the issues I raised after the last visit, replacing the ruined carpets, fixing the leak, and instituting an emergency phone number to report disrepair issues in future. Today, they also promised to set out a timetable for works, pledged to communicate properly around any future delay in repairs and committed to a meeting to run through service charges with residents and explain exactly what they’re getting for their money.\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_23rd-october-2022/content_644.html": "This week, I spoke against Tory plans to expand police powers that would further undermine the right to protest and discriminate against people of colour. From the Suffragettes to the Chartists, our country’s rich tradition of dissent paved the pathway for the rights and freedoms we have today but this Bill would ban the protests that won trade unions and votes for women.\nAs well as introducing further curbs on protest and expanding discriminatory stop and search powers, it would introduce jail sentences and unlimited fines for demonstrating around national infrastructure like airports, railways and printing presses or “locking on” to buildings. Amnesty UK argues that “these authoritarian provisions…. are similar to repressive policies in countries the UK regularly criticises, including Russia, Hong Kong & Belarus”.\nI tabled three of my own amendments to push back against this Bill: New Clause 15, for a public inquiry into impact of public order policing on Black, Asian & minority ethnic people; New Clause 16, for a full equality impact assessment of the act published within three months; and New Clause 17, for a public inquiry into protest policing – including the use of force, kettling, police horses and the Policing Act 2022.\nInstead of tackling injustices like climate breakdown, low pay, inequality & racism, this Government is doubling down on policies that helped create them and cracking down on people who speak out against them.\nIn a ray of light in an otherwise dismal and repressive piece of legislation, we did see New Clause 11 included in the Bill.

This is funded by our Government to the tune of millions. One key take home for me is that it is an oversimplification to call France a safe country for many of the people stuck in limbo there. As our Government escalates its attack on people simply for seeking safety and security in our country, the trip was an important reminder of the need to centre compassion and humanity in our response to a humanitarian crisis.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_why-we-should-repeal-and-replace-the-coronavirus-act/content_253.html": "This week marks one year since the UK first went into lockdown and MPs voted to give the Government unprecedented and extraordinary powers under the Coronavirus Act. My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of the 127,000 people who have lost their lives since then.\nThe best way of honouring the dead is to protect the living. On Thursday, MPs have a chance to do this, when the Coronavirus Act comes back before Parliament.\nThe only possible justification for giving the Government the extraordinary powers outlined in the Coronavirus Act is to keep us safe. With the UK reckoning with the highest death toll in all of Europe and the deepest recession of any OECD country, it’s clear they have failed to do this.\nFar from protecting people, these measures have seen human rights jettisoned and left many people less safe. Last March, when the Act was introduced, human rights organisations warned that the powers it contained were loosely drafted, giving too much discretion to the home secretary and too much room for confusion.\nAt the Clapham Common vigil to remember Sarah Everard, we saw exactly what this meant. The police decision to stop women from exercising their civil liberties to express their grief and anger, left everyone less safe. They should never have been in a position to cancel it in the first place.\nIn practice, the Coronavirus Act has been used unlawfully and wrongfully against members of the public, without redress in many cases. We should be clear about who is bearing the brunt of unlawful and heavy-handed policing during the pandemic. In some parts of the UK, Black and Asian men have been seven times more likely to be fined under Covid laws.\nBy allowing local authorities to apply “easements,” the Act places disabled people, older people and those with mental illness in harm’s way. This measure is inseparable from the way the virus ripped through care homes and the fact that disabled people account for 60 per cent of all deaths during the pandemic.\nThese failings reflect the way the Government has tended to rely on policing their way out of the pandemic rather than providing people with the support they need to get through it. It didn’t have to be this way.\nInstead of giving the police extra powers to enforce the rules, they could have put the emphasis on giving people the support they need to stay at home: from proper sick pay to clamping down on employers forcing staff back into workplaces. Instead of removing social care easements, they could have increased the legacy benefits relied on by almost two million disabled people.\nAfter a catastrophic year, it’s clear we need substantive action to help those left vulnerable to the pandemic. It’s not too late to do the right thing. With a long way to go to full immunity, now is the time to put down legislation to protect everyone and support our recovery.\nVoting down the Coronavirus Act on Thursday would give us 21 days to put down new legislation that centres human rights and public health. Dawn Butler has already tabled a Bill that enjoys cross-party support, based on Liberty’s brilliant Protect Everyone Bill blueprint.\nAs well as protecting basic freedoms, this Bill includes a range of measures: from increasing Statutory Sick Pay to scrapping social care easements, ending the Hostile Environment, making workplaces safe, protecting our data, and preventing evictions.\nThe pandemic has shown us again and again that nobody is protected from coronavirus until everyone is. It’s time to recognise this and act.\nThis article first appeared on Politics Home on the 25th March 2021.",

We need to understand what has happened and more importantly, exactly why it has happened, so that we can stop it from happening again. From the disproportionate numbers of black and brown NHS workers dying to the surge in Black youth unemployment and the death of Belly Mujinga, the pandemic has shown that racism in our country is still a matter of life and death.\nI’ve been working closely with the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations (FEMHO) to ensure race is put front and centre of the Covid Inquiry.\nIn June 2022, I co-ordinated a cross-party letter on behalf of the FEMHO calling on the Government to include the unequal impact of the pandemic on minoritised communities in their Covid inquiry terms of reference and hear evidence from FEMHO. This was signed by 39 Labour, Green, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party MPs. I’m pleased that Downing Street has now accepted our recommendations.\nIn July 2022, I also hosted FEMHO’s inaugural meeting in Parliament where experts talked about poor outcomes for ethnic minority healthcare workers and discussed legal aspects of the inquiry.

I’d like to say a huge thank you to pupils and teachers from Christ Church Primary and Henry Cavendish Primary for inviting me to see their Jubilee celebrations alongside Councillor Sonia Winifred and Mayor Pauline George respectively.\n|\n|\nTory Ministers might believe that UK workers are “among the worst idlers in the world” (as Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Kwasi Kwarteng and Liz Truss wrote in 2012) but in reality, we have the lowest number of public holidays in the G20 and the growth of insecure work on their watch means lots of people are working longer hours to make ends meet – often without holiday pay. On the plus side, I was delighted to see that the first UK-wide pilot of the four-day working week has been rolled out this week. All the evidence shows this policy could be a win-win for employers and employees alike if implemented properly, delivering better work-life balance and better productivity.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nIn Parliament\nHolding the Tories’ Feet to the Fire over Partygate\n|\n|\nThe country is facing the worst squeeze on living standards in living memory. But this week, the Tories once again proved that helping people through this comes a distant second to helping their leader cling on to power. 59 % of Tory MPs voted to let the PM off the hook for holding Downing Street lockdown parties, lying about them and rewriting the rules to remove himself from accountability. Unsurprisingly, the same MPs voted against Labour’s motion to strengthen standards in public life and clean up Westminster.\nThe outcome of these votes only confirms that the Tories’ guiding principle is one rule for them and another rule for everyone else. But people are sick and tired of them hiding behind procedure to defend corruption. The lack of accountability for corruption, lying and law-breaking will only deepen public anger towards Westminster politics and the Conservative Party.\n|\n|\nRedress for Victims of the Football Index Collapse\n|\n|\nThe betting site Football Index collapsed in March 2021, going offline after a series of crashes in its “football stock market”, where users could buy and trade “shares” in leading players. The Gambling Commission, which regulated the company, suspended its licence, leaving customers with stakes of at least £90m in open bets trapped in the platform. The collapse of the Football Index has taken a devastating financial and mental toll on thousands of people up and down the country. I was proud to support my constituents’ calls for redress in this week’s Westminster Hall.\n|\n|\nReviewing Stop and Search\n|\n|\nThe Stop Watch Girls Project is an 18-month national research project funded by the national lottery, to interview young women about their experiences of Stop and Search. It was devised in response to girls and young women reporting stop-search encounters to be frightening and humiliating experiences. It was great to welcome them to Parliament to launch their female-led research project. Instead of ramping up Stop and Search, the Government should listen and learn from the racism and misogyny these women have faced and call a review.\n|\n|\nNational Security Bill\n|\n|\nSpeaking out against the Public Order Bill just before Recess\n|\nThis week in Parliament saw another piece of authoritarian legislation from a Government that is more interested in silencing its critics than ending the injustices they highlight. I voted against the National Security Bill, which represents an attack on public interest journalism. The National Union of Journalists has rightly pointed out that the National Security Bill does not protect disclosures in the public interest, meaning measures ostensibly targeting foreign spies can end up being applied to journalists and whistleblowers – as the Official Secrets Act has been in the past.\n|\n|\nPut Racial Inequalities Front and Centre of the Covid Inquiry\n|\nLast week, I co-ordinated a cross-party letter on behalf of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations (FEMHO) calling on the Government to include the unequal impact of the pandemic on minoritised communities in their Covid inquiry terms of reference and hear evidence from FEMHO. This was signed by 39 Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party MPs.

As more and more evidence of these issues comes to light, we’ve had apology after apology. But without openly acknowledging the institutional misogyny and racism that persist in policing and outlining a plan to address these issues, apologies are just reputation management. That’s why we’re asking the Home Secretary to consult people in our City on the appointment of the next Met Commissioner to ensure they confront these issues and restore community confidence in policing.\n|\n|\nCutting the Ribbon on the Unigate Nature Reserve\n|\n|\nLambeth Council recently declared two new Local Nature Reserves in Streatham as part of its Climate Action Plan to tackle the climate and ecological emergency facing our planet. In a borough where 60 percent of households are living in flats without access to private outdoor space, this will help ensure everyone in our community can access green space. I was delighted to cut the ribbon on the newly declared Unigate Wood nature reserve recently. It has been great to witness council and community working together to transform the Wood into the hidden gem it is today.\n|\n|\nExtend the Road Traffic Act to Protect Cats\n|\n|\nIn January 2022, my constituent Olivia was having a lie-in with her partner when she got a knock on the door from her neighbour, who gave her the tragic news that Dart had been struck by a car, killed, and left at the side of a road. After weeks of heartbreak and grief, Olivia was shocked to find out that when a motorist collides with a cat, they don’t legally have to report it. That’s because the Road Traffic Act doesn’t protect cats. She’s now on a mission to change the law to give cats the same legal protections as dogs, pigs, mules and other animals by compelling drivers to stop and report collisions with cats. If you haven’t already, please sign our petition and share it on social media with a picture of your furry friend!\n|\n|\n|\n|\nStanding up for Teachers and Campaigning to End Classroom Hunger\n|\n|\nIt was good to meet with Magic Breakfast outside of Parliament this week to hear about their work providing healthy breakfasts to children in Streatham and beyond. I back their call to boost spending by £75m to provide breakfasts to 893,000 more children. The cost of living crisis makes it all the more urgent to extend eligibility for Free School Meals. No child should be left struggling to concentrate because of classroom hunger.\nIt’s not just students who are struggling because of the financial squeeze. After a decade of school cuts and austerity, teachers are once again feeling the pinch as they face real terms pay cuts, and threats to their pensions. I addressed a branch meeting of the National Association of Headteachers this week to thank local school leaders for everything they’ve done to keep schools running through the pandemic. I restated my commitment to addressing the retention and recruitment crisis in the sector and giving our teachers the things they need to provide the highest standards of education to students.\n|\n|\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

The pandemic has meant that the regular right-wing scare stories have been displaced by frontpage splashes about our healthcare heroes. Boris Johnson has learned the hard way that you can’t get away with publicly praising key workers whilst making their lives harder. Last night’s U-turn on the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is a great result – made reality by years of applied pressure against the hostile environment from grassroots activists, and years of a Labour Party channelling this energy into a fairer migration policy. Unfortunately, it comes against the gloomy backdrop of the government pushing ahead with more anti-migrant policy.\nThis week, Parliament voted through the disastrous Immigration Bill, marking the second time in a decade that a Conservative government has chosen to retroactively remove the rights of people who have settled here. The Windrush scandal was the direct consequence of the government’s decision to pull the carpet from underneath Commonwealth citizens in 2014. From next year, EU nationals will be subject to the same hostile environment measures – including the IHS.\nOf course, that’s assuming they qualify. According to the Institute for Public Policy Research, under current immigration proposals, 69% of the UK’s current EU workforce would be ineligible for a visa. That is 90% of EU transport and storage workers, 75% of EU agricultural workers, 59% of construction workers, and, crucially, 66% of the people currently working in our health and social care sector. With 40,000+ nursing and 120,000+ social care vacancies already, that’s one hell of a key worker shortage.\nThe message to migrant key workers remains clear: thank you for your work and your money; now please close the door on the way out. One of the Home Office’s first announcements during the pandemic was that many so-called “low-skilled workers” in the NHS – carers, nurses, porters, cleaners – will also be unable to apply for UK work visas from January 2021. This is just one reason why I tabled a reasoned amendment to stop the bill in its tracks. Waiving the surcharge for healthcare workers alone is a hollow victory if they can’t make their lives here.\nLabour was right to push to exempt migrant NHS staff and carers from charges during coronavirus. It’s worth pointing out that our de facto policy position remains scrapping the entire 2014 Immigration Act, which includes provisions like the IHS, for everyone they apply to, not just NHS workers and carers. That means we must end the pernicious charging system for all migrants, not just those who are most visible at the current time.\nLast month, we saw the deadly consequences of current policy when a Fillipino man known only as Elvis died from coronavirus in his own home. Charity workers said he was deterred from coming forwards by the dual fear of medical costs and being reported to the Home Office. His tragic death makes it clearer than ever that as well as scrapping the IHS, we should also end data sharing between the Home Office and the NHS. This is something that the BMA and Doctors of the World have outlined their support for at the current time.\nCoronavirus is another important reminder that public health is precisely that, public, and that nobody in the UK will be free from coronavirus until everybody in our society is free from it. Universality was the founding principle of the welfare state and must underpin our country’s approach to the coronavirus crisis and its economic aftermath: providing help to all who need it to get the country back on its feet. That includes migrants, wherever they come from, whatever their occupation.\nThis article was first published on LabourList: https://labourlist.org/2020/05/the-hostile-environment-in-healthcare-hurts-everyone-we-must-maintain-the-pressure-to-end-it/",

My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and family of those who lost their lives in this horrific incident, and to the community as they recover from this act of terrorism.\nWhile a direct motive for the attack is still unknown, the gunman’s recent YouTube activity has caused speculation over his probable links to online women-hate groups referred to as incels (involuntary celibates). These murders are a stark reminder of the serious threat posed to women in particular, but also men, by incel culture.\nIncels understand society to be hierarchised along the lines of sexual attractiveness. These misogynists blame women and society for their lack of status and for forcing them into “involuntary celibacy”. While these groups spend a majority of their time bitterly cursing women for their lack of dating success within their online forums, their misogynistic hatred is not self-contained and the rise in social media has seen their toxicity spill out from their private groups.\nThe vicious hatred these incels hold for women can often be seen in the form of online “trolling” on social media platforms, sickening rape fantasies and violent death threats. More worryingly, however, their hatred has at times been manifested in deadly terror attacks such as the one which took place in Plymouth.\nThursday’s attack has demonstrated that we can no longer view incels as harmless online hate groups, or mere internet trolls. A spate of deadly incel attacks across the Atlantic and now here in the UK has made clear that at the root of incel ideology is a poisonous hatred for women and society that manifests in violent acts of terror.\nAfter the deadly 2018 Toronto van attack, perpetrated by incel extremist Alek Minassian, the Canadian authorities took the first step to tackling these misogynist groups by concluding the incel movement was a form of violent extremism. It’s time for the UK government to declare a similar commitment to tackling this dangerous subculture before more incel attacks take place. This must start with bringing forward the Online Harms Bill without further delay.\nI raised a question in the Commons to this effect in July. The response I received sought to reassure myself and other women of how the Bill may better enable women to report online abuse and make clearer “the links between what online companies say they do and what they actually do”. At no point during this response did the Minister indicate when this much-needed Bill would be brought forward.\nI raised this question fearing that, with the rise in incel popularity, that the UK may see similar attacks like those experienced across the Atlantic. Now that the threat posed by incel ideology in the UK has been tragically realised, the government must take action to prevent any further attacks.\nIn addition to this, action must be taken to protect young, vulnerable men who chance upon incel content and quickly find themselves being indoctrinated with the toxic misogynist ideology with the help of social media algorithms.\nYoung men do not suddenly wake up one day with a violent hatred of women, nor do they actively seek out incel content. Often, they find themselves having chanced upon these groups, starting with what appears to be a relatively harmless far-right YouTube video only to then be led down a rabbit hole of incel culture, guided by the helpful hand of the YouTube algorithm. Responsibility must be placed on online platforms to prevent this toxic ideology from gaining credence and indoctrinating more young men.\nThe government cannot sit back and do nothing as extremist incel culture gains popularity and increase their membership. If they are serious about protecting women, they will bring forward their Online Harms Bill and commit to taking genuine steps to tackle violent misogynistic online hate groups.\nThis article first appeared in full on Politics Home on the 17th August 2021.",

Using this emergency to ram through this corporate takeover bill is reckless. Forcing NHS staff to implement another top-down Tory reorganisation will take people away from the tasks of tackling growing treatment lists and coping with rapidly rising Covid cases.\nI voted against the Health and Care Bill at its second reading.

However, the urgent situation around the collapse of British Steel means I will be back in Parliament again tomorrow. Steel is an industry of massive strategic import. We need low-carbon steel for wind turbines and railways for our green transition. We need the ability to make it from scratch for our defence sector. I have been clear that nationalising British Steel is the best way to retain manufacturing capacity, guarantee jobs and secure the industry’s future. I will be following the government’s response to this evolving situation closely.\n|\n|\n|\nThe government has also enacted other meaningful improvements to workers’ rights in recent weeks. Last week saw a significant boost to minimum wage and national living wage, putting more money back in the pockets of our lowest earners. This week saw new neonatal leave rules enacted, which mean that families whose babies are born prematurely are now eligible for an extra 12 weeks paid leave. As someone with a keen interest in improving outcomes for mothers, babies and families, this is a very welcome step. It should make a massive difference to many families during an incredibly difficult and vulnerable period of their lives.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nClosure of Brixton Post Office\n|\n|\nThis week, we had news that the remaining 108 Crown Post Offices will cease operations from Autumn this year, including Brixton Post Office. This is bad news for postal services with all of these Post Offices set for closure or, at best, franchising. I have issued a statement on this, urging the government to do everything in its power to protect our postal services and guarantee existing services levels.\nRead my full statement on the issue on my website →\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBritish MPs Denied Entry to Israel\n|\n|\nOn Monday, there was a ministerial statement on Israel’s decision to deny two British MPs entry to the West Bank. The government has rightly spoken out against this decision, with the Foreign Secretary rightly condemning it as “disgraceful”. In my intervention, I asked for clarity on what it will take for the government to stop supplying arms for use against civilians in Gaza.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBernie Grant Memorial Lecture\n|\n|\nOn Tuesday evening, I had the honour of giving this year’s Bernie Grant Memorial Lecture in Parliament, 25 years after the great man’s passing. Bernie Grant was one of Labour’s first Black MPs. He didn’t just make history, he changed it, reminding Britain of the truths it tried so desperately to forget about empire, colonialism, slavery, and the lasting debts owed to African people and their descendants. I founded the All-Party Group for Afrikan Reparations to continue this proud legacy and bring the voice of the global reparations movement into Parliament. In Bernie’s name, we will continue to challenge colonial amnesia, hold institutions accountable, and demand reparations not as a favour but as a right.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nRelationship Education in Schools\n|\n|\nLast week, I took part in a debate on relationship and sex education in our schools. I pointed out that there are still significant shortcomings in our approach to relationship and sex education, with many children falling through the gaps. In an era where we are seeing patriarchy reasserting itself through new cultural and ideological forms, from inceldom to the manosphere, this problem takes on renewed urgency.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nWe need comprehensive relationship and sex education that is age-appropriate and delivered by well-trained teachers, who could be crucial in combating this ideology. Like all forms of discrimination, misogyny is ignorance. Education is the best tool against ignorance, but it must be properly funded and teachers properly trained to deliver it.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSupporting People Living with HIV & AIDS\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOver a number of years, Catholics for Aids Prevention have built a welcoming peer-led community of people living with HIV and AIDS in our area.

This event brought together policymakers, industry leaders, and changemakers for discussions on climate action, ethical supply chains, and the intersection of sustainability and economic development. True sustainability is about designing systems that waste nothing and value everything: from natural resources to human labour.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nHosting German students in Parliament\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOn Thursday, I hosted students from Germany in Parliament for a discussion on ‘The West’ as part of their studies on this concept. It is great to see educators encouraging critical thought on this issue, giving students the skills to challenge Eurocentrism and reconsider concepts from alternative cultural and political perspectives.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_black-maternal-health-debate/content_539.html": "In November, I secured a debate on Black Maternal Health. In 2022, Black women in the UK are over three times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts. Behind the harrowing statistics on Black maternal health, there are thousands of harrowing stories, which shine a light on the racial bias and discrimination that exist in maternity care.\nAs well as addressing the socioeconomic factors driving poor health outcomes for Black mothers, we need to address disparities in maternity care by listening and acting on these stories. When the Government is asked take action, they often claim they don’t have enough data. So I took the chance to highlight some of the reports outlining Black, Asian and minority ethnic women’s experiences of maternity care, which set out some of the issues pretty clearly.\nSince I secured the first ever Black Maternal Health Awareness Week debate last year, there has been little discernible progress. It’s not enough for the Government to simply say they are listening. They need to move beyond words by setting binding targets to end racial health disparities in maternity care, as Labour has this week pledged to do. The colour of a mother’s skin should have no impact on her baby’s health or her own.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_faqs-the-war-in-gaza/content_42.html": "I have received thousands of emails from constituents since October 7th 2023 regarding the horrific violence witnessed in Israel and Gaza. Indeed, no single topic has been the subject of more correspondence since I was first elected in 2019. It is important that so many of you have felt compelled to contact me about this situation and I have tried to respond to people as quickly as possible. Due to the range of emails I have received, I have tried to address the varying issues raised on this page. I also apologise if you have already contacted me regarding this issue and are receiving similar responses. I firmly believe consistency on this matter is important.\nBritain’s history in the region and the role it has played in creating this cycle of killing and bloodshed places a special responsibility on us to push for peace. Our government must make every effort to call for this, not to fan the flames of war. Our immediate priorities must be ending the military offensive on Gaza, allowing humanitarian access to food, water, energy and medicines, and securing the safe return of all hostages. Our long-term priority must be peace, ensuring the fundamental rights of all Palestinians and Israelis are upheld. A just and lasting peace can only be achieved through the equal application of international law.\nI am deeply concerned by Israel’s decision to break the ceasefire\nI cautiously welcomed the ceasefire enacted on 19th January 2025, intended to bring the fighting to an end in three main phases. During the first six-week phase of this ceasefire deal, we did see the release of a wave of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However, at least 140 people were killed in Gaza during the time the ceasefire was supposedly in place. We also saw Israel blockading aid to Gaza and cutting off electricity, once again attempting to deny Palestinians the basic necessities of survival. In another worrying turn of events, Israel sent tanks and troops into the West Bank, where almost 1,000 Palestinians have now been killed since October 7th.\nThis period of reduced hostilities was shattered overnight on Tuesday 18th March by a series of airstrikes that killed and injured hundreds of Palestinians—183 children and 94 women among them. It has been clear for a long time that calling for a ceasefire alone is not sufficient to prevent the continuation of this genocidal war. At this crucial juncture, we need to see our government taking decisive action to put pressure on Israel to stop.\nPut simply, we need to see our government ending all arms sales to Israel (not just some), taking a clear line on the illegality of Israel’s actions and implementing sanctions for the widespread human rights abuses seen during this war. It is also absolutely vital that the government complies with its international legal obligations and helps to ensure that all those who are guilty of war crimes can be brought to justice. I will continue to urge the UK government to do all of these things and do everything in its power to end the ongoing slaughter in Gaza and the West Bank.\nI condemn violence against innocent civilians on October 7th 2023 and since\nI am appalled by the killings witnessed in Israel, Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. I utterly condemn Hamas’ kidnap and murder of innocent Israeli civilians. I was alarmed to hear reports of the use of sexual violence in these attacks. We must do everything to secure the safe return of these hostages and bring those accountable to justice. I am very alarmed by the reports of war crimes since the 7th October and support calls for these to be investigated.\nAll nations have the right to respond to acts of terror. All nations also have a duty to prevent the commission of war crimes in so doing. I condemn the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza and the scale of the subsequent offensive, which has resulted in an alarming number of civilian deaths.\nThe Israeli Government’s decision to cut off energy, water and food to the entire civilian population, repeated orders for millions of people to leave their homes, and the routine bombardment of civilian personnel and infrastructure represent collective punishment which is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions.\nI’ve long called on the government to recognise a Palestinian state\nUK recognition for a Palestinian state shouldn’t be dangled as a prize at the end of peace process. Treating Palestine and Israel as equal partners is a prerequisite for any just and lasting settlement. The UK government won’t be part of the solution until it recognises this. Labour’s 2024 manifesto committed us to “recognising a Palestinian state as a contribution to a renewed peace process”. I will push the government to follow through on this.\nI have consistently called for a UK arms embargo against Israel\nI have long raised concerns about the UK government’s role in supplying military hardware to Israel, which may have been used against civilians in Gaza and potentially even against British citizens. I have signed EDM #177, calling on the government to halt arms sales to Israel and I also echoed these calls during a Westminster Hall debate on the 12th December 2023.\nIn February 2024, I joined more than 200 elected representatives to call for an immediate embargo on arms sales to Israel. The ICJ ruling means this is now not just a moral necessity now but a legal one. I was a signatory on Zarah Sultana’s letter urging the government to suspend arms sales in March 2024 and a principle sponsor on her King’s Speech amendment in July 2024 to end arms sales and uphold international law.\nIt seems increasingly clear that exporting military hardware made in Britain to be used in the mass slaughter of Palestinians and civilians from elsewhere is not just immoral but clearly illegal. It puts us on the wrong side of international law.\nI condemn the deliberate targeting of healthcare professionals, journalists and aid workers\nAmid the appalling civilian casualty count, it is incredibly distressing to see the high numbers of aid workers, health providers, and journalists who have lost their lives since October. In what has been the deadliest war for aid workers in the history of the UN, at least 224 aid workers have lost their lives. Gaza’s Ministry of Health has recorded the deaths of at least 484 health workers and its Media Office has stated that 140 journalists and media workers have been killed.\nWhen three UK aid workers from World Kitchen Central were killed in cold blood on the 1st April 2024, UK political leaders refused to even call for a proper independent investigation into their deaths, never mind suspend arms sales to the forces that killed them. It is disgraceful that the last government put Israel’s war above the lives of British citizens. There should be a full independent investigation into their deaths.\nI have signed EDM 284 which calls for the protection of journalists reporting on the events in Gaza, EDM 254 which calls for the creation of a short-term medical evacuation for children in Gaza, and EDM 327 which recognises the work of healthcare professionals in Gaza and supports calls for them to receive the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize.\nI consistently called for UNRWA funding to be reinstated\nOn the 19th July 2024, I was relieved to see funding reinstated to UNRWA, the one agency with the infrastructure and expertise to supply aid across Gaza. I agree with the Foreign Secretary that aid funding to Gaza is a “moral necessity in the face of such a catastrophe”. I spoke out against the decision to withdraw funding at the time, which was made on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.\nI believe our government and the international community must do more to get aid into Gaza\nGaza has been pushed to the brink of a major famine and faced the most severe food crisis in the world. Children in Gaza have died from malnutrition and dehydration. IDF operations in Gaza have blocked the delivery of water, food, and fuel, razed agricultural areas and wilfully impeded other forms of humanitarian assistance. Israeli officials have publicly expressed their aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of food, water, and fuel. The starvation of Palestinians is not an act of God but a deliberate policy, supported by all those who have failed to call for a ceasefire or call out war crimes.\nThe biggest limiting factor for aid delivery into Gaza was the enormous tonnage of bombs being dropped on the area. There is seemingly no end to the mental gymnastics that western political leaders were willing to engage in to avoid calling for the immediate and permanent ceasefire needed to prevent more mass civilian casualties and allow backed up food trucks to enter.\nThe current ceasefire means we are now seeing the biggest influx of aid to Gaza since October 7th 2023, with more than 630 aid trucks entering on the first day alone. I urge the government to\nMy stance on the ICC arrest warrants\nOn the 20th May 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) filed applications for warrants of arrest for senior leaders in Hamas and Israel. This is an important legal case, which offers the possibility of breaking through what Human Rights Watch has called “the wall of impunity” that Israel has long hidden behind.\nThe previous Conservative government lodged an objection to this case at the time, taking their lead from the Biden Administration. I opposed this attempt to thwart the judicial process at the time and signed EDM (Early Day Motion) 14 when the new Labour government came in. This urged the government to reverse this position, which it thankfully did on the 26th July.\nOne of the most important tools we have for preventing civilian deaths is ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice. If Benjamin Netanyahu or Yoav Gallant come to Britain, it’s absolutely essential that we comply with our treaty obligations and turn them over to face justice.\nMy stance on the ICJ ruling\nOn the 29th December 2023, South Africa made a submission to the United Nations International Court of Justice (ICJ) to declare Israel in breach of its obligations to the 1948 Genocide Convention, alleging that “acts and omissions by Israel” in Gaza “are genocidal in character” and have been committed with “the requisite specific intent” to “destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and [ethnic] group”. South Africa asked the ICJ to issue Provisional Measures and order Israel to “immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza”.\nOn the 26th January 2024, the ICJ ruled in favour of South Africa, ordering Israel to take steps to prevent and punish any incitement of genocide in Gaza and to allow humanitarian aid into the territory. Israel was also obligated to report back to the court in one month on the actions it was taking to this effect. I welcomed the ICJ ruling on this issue but like others, I was dismayed that the judgement fell short of calling for a ceasefire. In my view, the only way to prevent genocide in the region was for Israel’s allies, most notably the US, to press for an immediate ceasefire.\nI condemn the undemocratic treatment of pro-peace protesters\nThe mass arrest of people protesting the Gaza genocide in January 2025 (including democratically elected representatives) was an outrageous infringement of our rights to free speech and free assembly. The ceasefire protests of the last fifteen months have been overwhelmingly peaceful, diverse, and well-attended. Those in attendance are many of the same people rightly celebrated across our society for standing up to the far right during last summer’s riots. I believe these repressive police actions highlight the pressing need for the repeal of anti-protest legislation designed to silence those seeking to highlight social injustices.\nSupporting Muslim and Jewish communities in the UK\nI am concerned to hear reports of rising levels of Islamophobia and Antisemitism in the UK, and around the world. No one deserves to face hate or prejudice because of their religious beliefs and minority groups should not be targeted because of international conflict. Anyone who has suffered or witnessed Antisemitism is encouraged to contact the Community Security Trust. Anyone who has suffered or witnessed Islamophobia is encouraged to contact Tell Mama UK. These two organisations are involved in mapping hate crimes.\nSupporting constituents with stranded families\nAs well as failing to push for a ceasefire, the last government did not do enough to help people leave the warzone. During the first few weeks of the conflict, I was contacted by constituents trapped in the occupied West Bank and unable to leave. I have also been contacted by at least one constituent whose relatives were unable to flee Gaza because there is nowhere for them to submit the biometric data our government requires of them. I’ve been glad to see families challenging this decision in the courts and winning.\nIf you are a constituent and require assistance with leaving the territory or with family reunion, please reach out to my office at bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nI support the creation of a Palestinian family reunion scheme\nThe last government’s response to the plight of Palestinian refugees driven from Gaza was typical of their punitive approach to people seeking safe passage in our country. I found this out for myself when my constituent attempted to apply for family members to join him in February. They were rejected because they could not provide the biometric data that the Home Office requires of them. By asking Palestinian refugees to apply in Ramallah, Jerusalem, or in a nearby country, the last government effectively told people they would have to travel through an active warzone to submit information.\nRefugees with relatives in the UK are trapped in a bureaucratic nightmare: they cannot enrol their biometrics because they cannot leave Gaza and they cannot leave Gaza because they cannot enrol their biometrics.\nWhen millions were displaced by Russia’s appalling invasion of Ukraine in 2021, the last government rightly had the Homes for Ukraine Scheme live in a matter of weeks. Yet they have refused to create a similar pathway for Palestinians with relatives already living in the UK. The Home Office has rejected every request from Palestinian refugees for biometric deferral and predetermination since the 7th October. Yet between 15th March 2022 and 7th December 2023, Ukrainian nationals could apply online without the need to do this until after reaching safety in the UK.\nIt is important to state clearly that the one thing Palestinians want more than anything is a safe return to their homes, as is their human right. Sadly, the inordinate civilian death toll in this conflict means that many Palestinians simply will not be alive to exercise this right. In the debate on this issue on the 13th May 2024, I made my views on this very clear, calling once again for a ceasefire, an arms embargo against Israel, and the creation of a Palestinian family reunion scheme.\nI opposed the Tories’ Anti-Boycott Bill\nEven as the bombs rained down on Gaza, the last government was actively seeking to close down routes for peaceful, democratic resistance to what is happening there. Its Anti-Boycott Bill would have prevented public bodies from taking a stand against companies that profit from war crime and human rights abuses, including in Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nBoycott tactics have been used throughout history to challenge abusive, discriminatory and illegal practices: from the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade to the fall of South Africa’s apartheid regime, and bus boycotts challenging segregation and racism in Jim Crow states of the Southern USA.\nThis legislation would have protected countries and companies involved in fossil fuels, the arms trade, and human rights abuses from facing democratic pressure for their actions. I am relieved that the last government was unable to pass it before they disintegrated.\nI opposed the invasion of Rafah and called on our government to take action to stop it\nIsrael’s incursions into Rafah, a city more densely populated than Paris or Mumbai, lent renewed urgency to ceasefire calls. As well as the serious likelihood of injury and death to a civilian population, this operation led to another forcible transfer of a civilian population: a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.\nRafah is not just home to a vast number of Palestinian refugees displaced by the bombing and fighting but a vital conduit for humanitarian aid to enter a region on the brink of famine. The most recent offensive choked this off and has forced aid organisations to re-establish already fraught supply lines.\nEven before a full-scale assault on the area, medical facilities were already overwhelmed. As of 10th May 2024, there were just three partially functioning hospitals in Rafah.\nThe last government should have taken every available option to stop this from happening. At the time, I condemned their failure to emulate the US’s decision to pause arms shipments to Israel. I have long urged the cessation of UK arms sales to Israel. I have also been clear that they need to take a much harder diplomatic stance towards this conduct by refusing to provide cover for Israel at the UN and supporting international efforts to bring war criminals from both parties to this conflict to justice.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_an-update-from-your-local-mp-21st-february-2025/content_220.html": "We started the week with some excellent news. Clapham residents are getting a new Post Office branch on Clapham Park Road. This news comes in the aftermath of the closure of Clapham Common Crown Post Office in March last year. The decision to close this busy branch attracted widespread local opposition and we launched a community-led campaign to protect our postal services. The proposed new franchise at 82-84 Clapham Park Road would help plug the gap left by the loss of the Clapham Common branch. The consultation on this proposal is open from now until the 20th March 2025.\nThis week, I visited the Omnibus Theatre in Clapham, an iconic local arts venue and hub. I met with the artistic director, trustees and board members to discuss what we can do to support the team at the theatre and wider performing arts community.\nOn Thursday, the government announced a further £100 million of new arts, heritage and culture funding. This announcement came on the sixtieth anniversary of a Labour government delivering the country’s first ever Arts White Paper. I hope this signals the start of a new era of commitment to our arts and creative industries.\nSupporting GPs and General Practice staff\nIt was great to meet with GPs working in the constituency this week to hear their thoughts on improving these vital services. Under the last government, we lost a lot of GPs and saw a general decline in population health which both contribute to the struggles many of us face trying to get a GP appointment today. I was glad to get GPs’ input. It is vital that the government keeps working to ease burdens on all general practice staff and ensure the GP workforce is fully funded to deliver high-quality care to everyone.\nVisiting Liberty Wines Ltd\nI visited Liberty Wines Ltd in Clapham – one of the first UK wine companies to commit to going carbon neutral. It was good to meet staff and discuss some important issues: from Brexit’s damaging effects to alcohol duty reforms and how we can best apply new environmental packaging laws.\nOxford Reparations Debate\nI travelled to Oxford to speak in a debate concerning reparations as a part of the university’s ‘Debating the “Difficult”’ series. With member states of the African Union meeting this week in Addis Ababa to try to coordinate their stance on the issue, it’s clear that the call for reparations can no longer be simply brushed aside. It is important for UK politicians to listen to what countries in the Global South are actually calling for. At their root, reparations are about repair and undoing some of the lasting damage eventuated by Europe’s colonialisation of global South countries and its mass enslavement of African peoples.\nMeeting with Holy Trinity Church\nOn Thursday, I met with Holy Trinity Church to discuss the impact of changes to the Listed Places of Worship Grant scheme. A new cap on the amount of VAT that can be reclaimed on building repairs covered under this scheme has left the church facing a large shortfall on a renovation project, meaning disruption and added construction costs. I will be writing to the government regarding this issue and urging them to waive the cap in instances where works have already commenced.\nMeeting with Grantham Road Residents\nI met with members of the Lambeth Self Help Housing Association (LSH) to discuss concerns about a proposed redevelopment, which threatens to demolish homes on Grantham Road. Residents are understandably worried by the threat of displacement, the environmental impact of rebuilding rather than retrofitting and the loss of much-valued green space. I will be raising their concerns (and mine) with the developer in question.\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

Something to tackle sky-high energy bills? Something to address the climate crisis? Something to address the NHS staffing crisis?

We need to save Streatham’s station ticket offices.\nLosing ticket offices at our Streatham stations would have particularly damaging consequences for elderly and disabled people in our community but unattended stations are less safe for everybody.\nThe potential closure of more than 1,000 ticket offices across the network also poses a serious risk to thousands of jobs at a time when people up and down the country are contending with soaring living costs across the board.\nAt the heart of this is a question of who our rail is run for: for the benefit of everyone who relies on it and the workers who keep it running; or for the benefit of a few companies and their shareholders.\nThat’s why I’ve launched this petition to Save Streatham’s Station Ticket Offices. You can add your name below if you’d like to support the campaign.\nWith these proposals in motion, rail fare increases mean the cost of a season ticket between Streatham and Central London has risen by 46% since 2010. It’s unjustifiable for rail companies to charge more and more while delivering less and less to the passengers who pay for their services.\nFor more information on this you can see RMT’s Save Our Ticket Offices campaign.\nSign my Petition to Save Streatham’s Station Ticket Offices\nBringing better transport to Streatham and getting more people onto public transport are important priorities for me.

I welcomed positive steps the government has taken since coming to power, such as scrapping the unworkable Rwanda scheme and closing the Bibby Stockholm barge. However, it is very difficult to be positive about this legislation as currently put forwards.\nThis legislation fails to implement the one measure that would put people smugglers out of business and prevent refugees from making these crossings in the first place: safe routes. I also spoke against the expansion of immigration detention, the removal of protections for modern slavery victims and the criminalisation of people seeking safety in line with international law. In opposition, our frontbench rightly opposed such measures, tabling reasoned amendments to throw out the Nationality & Borders Act 2022 and the Illegal Migration Act 2023 on these precise grounds.\nI have signed and sponsored Nadia Whittome’s EDM 799, expressing my concern over plans to refuse of citizenship to refugees who have made dangerous crossings to the UK. This policy further punishes these individuals whose claims of fleeing war, persecution, and danger have been upheld by the asylum system. I am deeply concerned that the refusal of citizenship denies security and a safe, permanent home to those seeking asylum.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_4th-february-2023/content_627.html": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBell’s Newsletter\n4th February 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDear *|FNAME|*,\nWednesday witnessed the largest day of strikes in eleven years, with teachers launching their first day of strikes alongside walkouts from civil servants, public transport workers and university staff. The scale of the walkouts we’re now seeing reflects the scale of the crisis facing our society, economy, and public services after the policy choices of the last thirteen years. Whilst real wages have plunged and public services have crumbled, the richest in society have got richer than ever before.\n|\n|\nI started the day on the picket lines with teachers at Bishop Thomas Grant and Dunraven. Since 2010, the average teacher in England has seen their annual salary eroded by £6,600 in real terms. Per pupil funding in England has fallen by 3% in real terms in the same period. Teachers deserve better, children deserve better.\nI went on to join striking Streatham Job Centre staff, who work so hard to support people in our area amid economic downturn and rising unemployment. Along with 100,000 other civil servants in the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union, they’re fighting for fair pay and pensions, job security and funding for public services.\nI also met up with the Lambeth branch of the National Education Union (NEU) to speak at their rally in Windrush Square. This was ahead of 40,000-strong march through Westminster to send a message that our teachers deserve better.\nBefore marching, I also joined members of the International Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) Union and University and Colleges Union (UCU) Union. University staff are united in their struggle for fair pay, pensions, conditions, job security and an end to outsourcing. With UCL sitting on an annual budget surplus of over £90,000,000, now’s the time to address this situation.\nThe disruption people have been facing this week only underscores how vital these striking workers are to the functioning of society. It pales in comparison to the chronic disruption we face when the Tories are allowed to run our public services into the ground. The Government has to start negotiating with striking workers if it’s going to bring strikes to an end.\n|\n|\nDefending our Right to Demand Better\n|\n|\nThis week the Government steamrollered ahead with legislation that would see teachers, nurses, and rail workers sacked for going on strike. This isn’t about ensuring basic standards in public services, it’s about stopping workers from demanding them. It’s not a Minimum Service Levels bill, it’s a Forced Pay Cuts bill for some of the most important workers in our society. I spoke against this attack on the right to strike at third reading this week.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOne Rule for Millionaires, Another for Hard-Working NHS Workers\n|\n|\nThis week, I spoke in favour of reducing application fees for overseas healthcare workers seeking indefinite leave to remain. At a time when one in ten posts in our NHS is unfilled, we can’t afford to lose any of our dedicated staff. The Government claims it doesn’t want to give special exemptions to NHS workers but this is clearly an excuse when we look at the way our immigration system actually works. It is built on exemptions and special treatment. The special exemptions that exist for the super rich show it’s one rule for hard-working NHS staff, another for multimillionaires. The Government should be encouraging staff to stay and valuing all our NHS workers properly, no matter where they were born.\n|\n|\nParliamentary Visit to Kenya\n|\n|\nI visited Kenya last week as part of a parliamentary delegation to see how CAFOD and the Coalition for Global Prosperity are supporting communities on the frontline of climate breakdown. We travelled north into Marsabit County to visit Demo and Burgabo: two remote areas of the country which have been decimated by one of the worst droughts in living memory.\nAccording to Carbon Brief analysis, extreme weather events in Africa killed at least 4,000 people and affected a further 19 million in 2022. Our visit took place after a year of widespread drought and famine across the east of the continent, serious flooding in Chad and Nigeria, severe storms in southern Africa, and raging wildfires in Tunisia. We saw the devastating consequences of this first-hand and heard from people living in these communities.\nAfter four failed rainy seasons, water is scarce, crops aren’t growing, and livestock are dying. In some places it hasn’t rained for two years. In a country where livestock is people’s livelihoods, an estimated 1.5 million livestock died in Kenya alone during the failed 2022 March-May rainy season. We saw this first hand, with animal carcasses littering the arid landscape.\nWith Kenya facing a debt crisis, the country is left confronting this dire situation with both hands tied behind its back. The work organisations like CAFOD and Coalition for Global Prosperity do to mitigate the impact of climate breakdown in the region of East Africa is absolutely essential. Sadly, the Government’s decision to slash the aid budget puts many such projects at risk.\nAs well as urging them to reverse cuts to overseas development, I’ll also continue to push the Government to take action on the huge sums that private lenders are demanding from countries in the Global South. With 90% of these contracts governed by English law, they have a real chance to lead on this.\n|\n|\nStreatham Stands Together\n|\n|\nThis week witnessed two important anniversaries. I’m thinking of everyone impacted by the Streatham terror attack, which happened three years ago this week. I’ll always be proud of how Streatham stood together in the face of an attack designed to sow fear and division within our diverse community.\n|\n|\nBrexit is Still the Elephant in the Room\n|\nIt also marked the three-year anniversary of the UK’s departure from the EU. Since that fateful date, Brexit has only compounded the problems facing our country. It has deepened the economic crisis, undermined peace in Northern Ireland, and paved the way for the wholesale destruction of laws protecting workers, the environment, and food standards. This year’s IMF forecast shows the UK is the only G7 country facing negative growth. At this week’s PMQs, Rishi Sunak claimed that our country’s dire economic outlook has nothing to do with the estimated £100bn we are losing to Brexit every year. It’s time for the Tories to confront the elephant in the room and admit that this has been a total disaster.\n|\n|\nVote to Renew Streatham Business Improvement District!\n|\n|\nLocal businesses have until the 9th February to vote for the renewal our Business Improvement District (BID)! During my time as an MP, I’ve been so impressed with all Streatham BID’s work to upgrade our High Street and get more people shopping in Streatham. The investment they have channelled into our area has made a tangible difference to our area. Without Streatham BID, there would be no Streatham festivals, Christmas trees and lights, hanging baskets, or business support. I’d urge small businesses to keep supporting their investment in our community and for everyone living locally to encourage their favourite small business to vote.\n|\n|\nMeeting with St Martin’s Estate Residents\n|\n|\nIt was good to meet with leaseholders from the St Martin’s Estate on Thursday morning to discuss their campaign against damp. MPs spend so much of our time helping constituents with damp, disrepair and other housing issues. Landlords need to spend less time blaming residents for structural issues and more time getting on with repairs.\n|\n|\nSpeaking at the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent\n|\n|\nI was pleased to deliver a keynote speech at the United Nations (UN) Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent (WGEPAD). These human rights experts travelled up and down the country for ten days to examine the racism faced by people of African descent. They warned that people of African descent continue to encounter racial discrimination and erosion of their fundamental rights, describing how the Government creates “really complex narratives trying to justify inaction”. They will present a report with their findings and recommendations to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2023.\n|\n|\nMeeting with Refugee Action\n|\n|\nI met with Refugee Action on Thursday to discuss the campaign to lift the ban on asylum seekers working. Under current immigration rules, people can only apply for permission to work if they have waited for longer than twelve months, and only for jobs on the Government’s highly restrictive Shortage Occupation List. Your human rights are not and never should be conditional on your ability to work. However, it is ridiculous to stop people from willingly contribute in this way when we consider the fiscal benefits, the integration, and the impact on people’s wellbeing. I’m pleased to support the Lift the Ban coalition’s efforts to win the right for asylum seekers to work after six months, unconstrained by the Shortage Occupation List.\n|\nAs ever, if you have any questions about the work I’m doing as MP, please get in touch at this address: bell.ribeiroaddy.mp@parliament.uk.\nBest wishes,\nBell Ribeiro-Addy,\nLabour MP for Streatham\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nKeep up to date with my work by following me on social media\n|\n|\n|",

The five police officers and four members of the public caught up in the attack have thankfully been discharged from hospital. I am incredibly grateful for their brave intervention in an incredibly scary and dangerous situation, which has left a woman with potentially life-changing injuries. I am relieved to hear that her children’s injuries are now not considered to be life-changing and know the whole community is hoping for everyone’s swift recovery.\nPolice have named the suspected perpetrator of the attack as Abdul Shokoor Ezedi, who remains at large and has connections to the Northeast of England. The latest confirmed sighting of the suspect took place at exactly 9pm at King’s Cross. Ezedi has sustained distinctive injuries to the right side of his face. Members of the public are advised not to approach him if they spot him and to call 999 instead.\nI have been working with police, local councillors, and the local authority in the aftermath of this shocking incident to reassure the community. It is very important not to speculate on this case.

Rather than creating a fair and humane asylum system, the Tories are punishing people who come here seeking safety and exposing them to further risk of exploitation and human rights violations.\nThis Bill does nothing to create safe routes for refugees, nothing to end the hostile environment, nothing to end the danger of unsafe asylum accommodation and nothing to address the bureaucratic hurdles leaving people without documentation through no fault of their own.\nRolling back on our international commitments\nInstead, the Government has put forwards a plan that rolls back our commitment to the 1951 Refugee Convention. Their Nationality and Borders Bill would create a two-tier asylum system which differentiates between those entering by resettlement, and those arriving spontaneously or having passed through countries deemed safe. We shouldn’t be creating arbitrary divisions between people who are all worthy of our support.\nLowering the bar even further on asylum accommodation\nThe Bill also includes clauses that would normalise the barracks-style accommodation we’ve seen at Napier and Penally. They plan to lower the bar even further by incorporating offshore detention for processing asylum seekers. Outsourcing asylum accommodation to other countries would mean moving people out of the UK without a fair hearing. It would also mean housing them away from public scrutiny in likely even worse conditions than at present.\nPlans to give border agents new powers to stop and divert vessels and dish out harsher sentences for people who steer boats across the Channel won’t stop people smugglers. These proposals ignore the valid reasons why asylum seekers might need to enter the country via the Channel. For instance, people stranded in France and desperate to reach loved ones or family members in the UK.\nPunishing refugees for seeking safety\nAs the Government very well knows, the people smugglers are not the ones driving the boats; they’re much higher up the chain of command. They will be laughing at these plans which do nothing to reduce the market of desperate people hoping to reach safety in the UK. If the Government was serious about putting people smugglers out of business in the Channel, there’s an easy solution: opening up safe routes for people to claim asylum here in the UK and ending the market.\nAttacking “activist lawyers”\nFinally, the Government is looking to consolidate their attacks on “activist lawyers” with rules that will make it harder for legal representatives to challenge bad decisions. They are also looking to increase the burden of proof on asylum seekers to prove their cases.",
  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_boris-johnson-is-on-his-way-out-but-the-tory-rot-runs-deeper-than-one-leader/content_241.html": "The decision by Boris Johnson to block a vote of no confidence shows he is ending his political career as he conducted it: rule-breaking, undemocratic and opposed to all accountability. Of course the Tories backed his decision.\nThe signal the Labour Party was trying to send remains. There cannot be any confidence in a government that has done such damage to our country since it was elected in just December 2019. Similarly, in a reversal of the New Labour theme song, there is confidence that things can only get worse under any of the possible successors to Boris Johnson.\nEqually clear is the signal that Labour is the alternative, that we stand ready, that we can win the next general election. On all current polling we are likely to win. This is the very good reason that it is extremely unlikely there will be a snap election called by the eventual victor in the Tory party race, and why the vote of no confidence was blocked. It has nothing to do with stability or constitutional propriety. It has everything to do with electoral calculation and the risk of a Tory drubbing.\nThe scale of the damage to this country is truly colossal. Supporters of Boris Johnson’s policies try to claim that every negative development was outside of his government’s control, whether that was the outbreak of the pandemic, the global surge in prices, the cost of living crisis or the dire state of public services.\nIt is true many of these were global events, with global causes. But there was no need for this country to have among the worst outcomes on almost every front. We have a far higher per capita Covid death toll even than the European Union (whose own policies were generally characterised by mismanagement and incompetence). We have the highest inflation rate in the G7. We have the worst GDP growth outlook in the G20, apart from Russia. We now have “winter in the NHS” in midsummer, and the government plan for energy and water shortages is for households to consume less. Truly world-beating.\nOne of the remarkable features of the brief Johnson administration is how, like his mentor Trump, he managed to remould the Tory party in his own dreadful image. As a result, there have been almost no dissenting voices in the Tory party on any substantive policy issues. The reason he had to go, as far as the parliamentary Conservative Party is concerned, is that allegations of sleaze and lying threatened to bring the whole party down with him.\nLying has become a stock in trade. Recent poverty data shows that the only “levelling up” that’s occurred is that the north east now surpasses London in terms of child poverty. Building back better has become reopening coal fields. Brexit is so far from done it has become a cause for government law-breaking in trying to rip up the Northern Ireland protocol. This is an attempt to impose on Ireland the same disastrous economic impact that the hard Brexiteers imposed on this country, risking a trade war and the Good Friday Agreement in the process.\nNone of the Tory candidates have uttered a word of criticism of any of these policies. They all support the Rwanda deportation policy, just as they all supported draconian legislation curbing the right to protest, or to offer legal immunity to police officers and service personnel.\nI remember when Rishi Sunak produced his Spring Statement just four months ago, which raised taxes and national insurance and cut pensions, benefits and public sector pay just as the cost of living crisis was getting into full swing. He was cheered to the rafters by all the Tories. That he is now castigated for being a “socialist” shows just how extreme his party has become.\nSo, despite their undemocratic manoeuvres, there can be no confidence in any of the contenders for the Tory leadership. It will be more of the same, or worse. We need a change of government.\nThis article first appeared on the Independent website on the 14th July 2022.",

Many young people may not even realise they do not have citizenship until they try to travel, get a job, rent a home or are suddenly asked to pay international fees for their university education.\nIf the £35 fee introduced in 1983 had risen in line with inflation, it would be £120 today. Instead, it is now £1,012 and one of the highest such fees in Europe, doubling in the last decade alone. We are charging British children ten times more to claim their citizenship rights than their counterparts in Spain, France, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden.\nOf the current fee, the Home Office reports that £372 accounts for administrative costs and freely admits that the remaining £640 is pure profit. Research by Citizens UK shows that between 2017 and 2020 alone, the government has made a £102,749,216 profit from these child citizenship fees.\nWhen I challenged the Prime Minister on this practice earlier in the year at PMQs, the Prime Minister said there were “costs that must be borne by the taxpayer” and that citizenship was “a prize”. The courts have consistently disagreed with the Prime Minister’s stance, with the Court of Appeal recently upholding the High Court’s ruling that this fee was unlawful and ordering the Home Office to reconsider it.\nOn questions of citizenship, it’s clear that the government knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. For these children, British citizenship is a legal entitlement, not a prize or an investment. Instead of endlessly appealing, they should accept it’s wrong to set fees so high that it blocks families from applying.\nMost of the children priced out of citizenship come from households facing higher levels of hardship and poverty. Many are from Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds. Some come from families slapped with the ‘no recourse to public funds’ condition, preventing them from accessing basic services.\nThe government continues to justify these fees on the basis of fiscal responsibility but it’s absurd that they believe an effective levy on poorer households is a sustainable way of financing their immigration system. Above all, there’s nothing responsible about creating a situation where children are deprived of their rights for want of money.\nIt’s also a scandal that many looked after children are emerging from our care system without British citizenship. These children have been entrusted to the care of the state. The state has a responsibility to get the best outcomes for them.\nI regularly speak to young people in my constituency who face feelings of worry, alienation and social exclusion as a result of being denied citizenship. The harm of being denied your citizenship rights in the only country you truly know cannot be overstated. It’s not just about the societal barriers you face, it’s about the psychological impact of being constantly treated as a second-class citizen.\nYou can’t put a price on belonging. Yet that’s exactly what this government continues to do. With the return of the nationality and borders bill, we have a chance to change this. My amendment to the legislation would cut the registration fee down to cost price, scrap it completely for looked after children and compel the government to produce a report on the impact that fees have on children’s right to citizenship.\nThese children are as British as anyone else. It is immoral and unjust that they continue to be blocked from citizenship and subjected to humiliating treatment as a result. If you grow up in the UK, British citizenship should be your right – not a privilege you pay the government large sums of money to bestow.\nThis article was first published on Labour List on the 7th December 2021.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_urgent-question-on-violence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territories/content_628.html": "This week, there was an Urgent Question in Parliament about what the UK Government was doing to put an end to the ongoing violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In the last two weeks, the USA has blocked a joint resolution from the United Nations Security Council calling for a ceasefire no less than three times. I asked the Minister of State for Middle East and North Africa what steps his Department was taking to put pressure on the USA to stop standing in the way of a peaceful resolution. Judging from the Minister’s non-answer, none. It is disappointing that the UK Government refuses to call out our allies when they are in the wrong.\nI also raised concern about our Government’s ongoing refusal to recognise the state of Palestine. Their stated commitment to a two-state solution is undermined by their failure to recognise one of the states this would include.\nIsraeli air strikes killed 232 Palestinians in the 10 days of fighting from 10th-20th May, including 65 children. 12 people have been killed in Israel, including 2 children. I am glad that the week has ended with a ceasefire. But there will be no lasting peace between the people of Israel and Palestine unless the international community will accept the fundamental asymmetry of this conflict and act accordingly.\nThat begins with recognising Palestine as a state with full membership of the United Nations and acknowledging the illegal conduct of Israel’s Government, from its settlements on the West Bank to the ongoing clearances of Palestinian families, settler violence in Jerusalem, the blockade of Gaza, and repeated human rights abuses in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nThe UK Government should also suspend all arms exports to Netanyahu’s Government until it can conclusively rule out the use of UK military hardware in the latest Israeli air strikes and consider imposing sanctions. We shouldn’t be doing business with countries that flout international law.",

  "https_bellribeiroaddy_com_/https_bellribeiroaddy_com_the-earth-is-facing-a-code-red-we-need-a-green-new-deal/content_60.html": "Today marks 100 days of the new Labour government – a critical period for setting the tone for any new administration. In this time, Labour has already introduced a raft of bills aiming to address the country’s multiple crises: bringing rail into public ownership, cracking down on the CEOs of mega-polluting water companies, establishing a publicly owned energy company, and more besides.\nBut it has also faced criticism and confusion from a public hungry for real change. During these first few months, something has become clear: while the new government does represent a break from the last 14 years of Tory mismanagement, there is still so much that the government must implement to address the scale of the crises we’re facing. This is the time for big ideas and big vision. And that means having a serious conversation about the Green New Deal.\nThe world’s leading scientists tell us that humanity is facing a “code red”. That without “immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5C” – the critical threshold for avoiding the most catastrophic climate outcomes – “is beyond reach”. Across the world, the climate crisis is already here, destroying lives and livelihoods, displacing people from their homes, and threatening huge shocks to the global economy.\nEven in the UK, we are already seeing the severe impact of climate change. 3,000 additional heat-related deaths were recorded in 2022’s extreme summer heatwave. And the climate crisis is wreaking havoc with international agricultural production, driving unaffordable supermarket price spikes for UK families.\nThis is a crisis of truly unprecedented proportions and it demands solutions on the same scale. We’re now halfway through a crucial decade for climate action and the truth is, the UK is dramatically off track to meet its own climate targets.\nWe can’t treat the climate crisis like any other political issue. Instead, we need to re-gear our whole economy towards tackling it – and do it in ways which make the economy fairer and life better and cheaper for ordinary people. That’s where the Green New Deal comes in. The Green New Deal is an ambitious plan for tackling the climate crisis and building a stronger, fairer economy in one fell swoop.\nFollowing the devastation of the First World War, in the face of a looming global depression and the ecological crisis of the dust bowl in the US, President Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. This was a massive programme of public investment which built up American infrastructure, put millions to work and staved off economic collapse. After the Second World War, here in the UK the Labour government delivered a historic programme of mass public investment which put millions to work, took core industries into public ownership and founded our NHS.\nIn times of crisis, governments need to step up. Just think what we could do with comparable investment in the green economy today. We could create millions of well-paid jobs in the green industries of the future: in nature restoration, clean energy, decarbonising infrastructure, and public transport. Our green transition must be a just one, which leaves nobody behind and gives everyone a stake in the planet we are trying to protect. We need a Green Jobs Guarantee, providing iron-clad assurance to workers that they will not be left behind and ensuring secure, decent jobs for young people.\nWe must also go further than simply bringing in more fines for failing private water companies. While welcome, these do not solve the fundamental problem of private companies profiteering from public infrastructure they should never have controlled in the first place. If we’re going to ensure every penny of investment works for people and the planet, we must bring essential public utilities, like water and energy, back under public ownership and end the rip off – just like we’re doing with our railways.\nI know Labour in power can meet this moment, but doing this will require historic ambition. This Labour government has the opportunity to be a transformative administration, studied in history classes for years to come. But only if it enacts a truly transformative economic programme that recognises the scale of change required and that politics-as-usual won’t deliver it.\nIf this government wants to succeed, avert climate disaster, and secure a strong, sustainable economic future for all communities, it must embrace and deliver a Green New Deal.\nThis article was first published by The Independent on 12th October 2024.",
