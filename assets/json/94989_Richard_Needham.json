In the course of my lifetime, the abundance of species across the UK has fallen on average by almost one fifth, Without urgent action here and internationally, our land, skies and seas will be even emptier and even quieter.\nWe now have a new Labour Government which is better on nature and climate than the Tories, but that’s a stunningly low bar to clear, and nowhere near good enough. While internationally, both the nature and climate summits have failed to deliver the change we need, and Trump has been elected to the White House.\nSo, what can we do to make progress when nature is in crisis and our political leaders aren’t even doing enough to deliver on pledges they have already signed up to, to protect and restore nature?\nGetting behind the work of our four MPs to prioritise nature action in this parliament is crucial. I am hugely proud that Carla, Adrian, Ellie and Sian have made such a formidable start in Westminster. They are brilliant politicians and campaigners and will work tirelessly to push Labour to do better – much better.\nBut they need your help. Ultimately, it’s not winning elections that counts. It is the difference our Green MPs will make to bringing about a huge prize – real hope and real change on the nature crisis.\nWe are living out of kilter with the natural world, destroying nature, and putting our own very survival at risk – a situation which must be turned around.\nThis is the battle of our lives and it’s worth fighting for.\nPlease get behind our four MPs and donate what you can to our Nature Action Now campaign.\nError: Contact form not found.",

You can read the Foreign Secretary’s response here.\nEllie also asked the Government about their failure to meet key environmental targets, and spoke in a debate about the importance of better palliative care.\nSian Berry MP\nSiân tabled a cross-party motion in Parliament calling on the Government to follow in the footsteps of over 100 local authorities and ban the use of pesticides in public places. This follows on from Sian’s Bill seeking to do the same thing and is part of a campaign with Pesticide Action Network.\nShe’s also been speaking out against the expansion of Heathrow, urging Ministers to follow the science and advice from their independent climate advisers: the Climate Change Committee.\nAdrian Ramsay MP\nAdrian has been standing up for his constituents on a wide range of topics this month, including setting out for the Minister the impact that the loss of dentists has on rural areas, highlighting how villages in Waveney Valley are struggling with poor broadband speeds, and speaking during a debate about flood preparedness. His contribution to the latter focused on nature based solutions in particular and can be read in full here.\nBaroness Jenny Jones\nJenny recently had hip replacement surgery, which has slowed her down this month, but she still found the energy to question the government’s failure to release IPP prisoners.\nWe have huge levels of prison over-crowding; delayed justice for victims whose cases have been put on hold and the early release of many convicted of serious offences. Despite this, the government is refusing to fast track the cases of IPP prisoners who have been locked up indefinitely for minor offences, such as stealing a plant pot, or a mobile phone. This scandal has led to many suicides and Jenny has met the Minister to try to help get it resolved.\nBaroness Natalie Bennet\nNatalie has spent a lot of the past month hosting events in parliament, which gives scientists, NGOs and campaigners the crucial access to MPs, Peers, officials, and journalists. In the past month Natalie has hosted:\n- The Green Economics Institute, celebrating 20 years of work to create a global network of intelligent and caring voices for social, environmental and economics justice and creating a multidisciplinary academic narrative of green economics! Speakers included Miriam Kennet, Anjikwi Mshelbwalla, Bianca Madison-Vuleta, and Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield.\n- A roundtable on Accelerating Human-Specific Technologies on behalf of Animal Free Research UK brought together leading experts in human-specific technologies and was attended by several MPs. The event included a call for Herbie’s Law to enable the phase out of animal testing in medical research.\n- A meeting of experts on Bovine TB Policy acknowledging that the science behind the badger cull is deeply and fatally flawed and has been a very costly distraction to the primary control effort needed – biosecurity to control this cattle disease.\nNatalie has also secured a debate in the Lords about Anaesthesia Associates and Physician Associates.",

Your three councillors took to the water at the River Meon in Droxford to measure the water quality.

So, are we doing enough?\nYou might think the June 2019 Climate Emergency declaration by Winchester City Council (WCC) and the subsequent creation of Winchester District’s ‘Carbon Neutrality Action Plan (CNAP)’ would have produced rapid progress with determined actions and projects. Frankly the jury must declare itself out on this question.\nClick to enlarge\nAt the end of last year, WCC received an updated Climate Crisis evidence base called the CNAP Roadmap which signposted a choice of improved actions. It is now 8 months on and the much-needed refresh of the CNAP to go faster with more coherent actions for key priority activities has still not been produced. Meanwhile, the latest Government data on greenhouse gas emission for our District has just been released UK local authority and regional greenhouse gas emissions national statistics, 2005 to 2021 – GOV.UK\nThe data highlights the growing size of the challenge: emissions per person in Winchester are the highest in Hampshire (see graphic) and sixth highest out of the 64 South East of England local authorities.\nWinchester Green Party Councillor Lee said: “There is no time to waste. We have the Carbon Neutrality\nAction Plan Roadmap which is an evidence base for improved actions plus the 2021 government update on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the District.

This is a wonderful initiative, funding applications for new local projects are open now, this support is especially welcome in these difficult times”.\nSo what is Farming in Protected Landscapes (FiPL) ?\nOverview:\nWe are very lucky to live in or have such a beautiful rural landscape on our doorsteps. Not only is most of it a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty but it’s also a\nhard working environment, farming being at the very heart of our local communities, both with regards to employment, socially, and being responsible for management of our environment.\nMany of us actually live within the boundaries of the South Downs National Park, over 75% of which is farmed.\nOur rural landscape supports a huge range of habitats and species, which are enjoyed by millions of people every year. So looking after our rural assets has broad positive impact, it’s not just local farmers and their supporting communities, but visitors to our area who support the local economy whilst enjoying everything our countryside, towns, villages, and the city of Winchester has to offer.\nFarmers and land managers in the country’s protected landscapes need support to protect what we have for future generations, in recognition of the role they play in managing these areas Defra has developed the Farming in Protected Landscapes (FiPL) programme as part of Defra’s Agricultural Transition Plan, which runs from July 2021 to March 2024.\nThe programme will pay for projects that provide value for money and result in at least one climate, nature, people or place outcome.\nThe programme will fund projects that:\n• support nature recovery\n• mitigate the impacts of climate change\n• provide opportunities for people to discover, enjoy and understand the landscape and its cultural heritage\n• protect or improve the quality and character of the landscape or place\nClimate Outcomes\nYour project should deliver:\n• more carbon being stored, sequestered or both\n• reduced flood risk\n• a better understanding among farmers, land managers and the public as to what different habitats and land uses can deliver for carbon storage and reduced carbon emissions\n• a landscape that’s more resilient to climate change\nNature outcomes\nYour project should deliver:\n• a greater area of wildlife-rich habitat\n• greater connectivity between habitats\n• better management of existing habitats for biodiversity\n• increased biodiversity\nPeople outcomes\nYour project should deliver:\n• more opportunities for people to explore, enjoy and understand the landscape\n• more opportunities for diverse audiences to explore, enjoy and understand the landscape\n• greater public engagement in land management, for example through volunteering\nPlace outcomes\nYour project should deliver:\n• enhancing or reinforcing the quality and character of the landscape\n• historic structures and features being conserved, enhanced or interpreted more effectively\n• an increase in the resilience of nature-friendly sustainable farm businesses, which contributes to a more thriving local economy (you must deliver this along with other outcomes)\nWho can apply?\n· The Farming in Protected Landscapes programme is open to all farmers and land managers within an AONB or National Park in England, or the Broads.\n· The programme is also open to farmers and land managers on land outside of protected landscapes.\nHow to apply\nBefore you apply, you should discuss your project with the protected landscape body, where you can also obtain an application form.\nYou can submit your application anytime up until the programme closes for applications in 2024.\nYour project must end by March 2024.\nFor us in the Winchester and Meon Valley area that body is the South Downs National Park Authority.\nThey can be found at https://www.southdowns.gov.uk/custodians/farming/farming-in-protected-landscapes-fipl/\nYou can check if your land is in a protected landscape\nhere https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?&chosenLayers=aonbIndex,npkIndex",

This practice not only harms our precious aquatic ecosystems but also poses a significant risk to public health. According to the Environment Agency, in 2020 alone, untreated sewage was released into English waters more than 400,000 times. The lack of stringent regulations allows these companies to continue this harmful practice without facing severe consequences.\nThe time has come for us to take a stand against this environmental injustice. We call upon the UK government and regulatory bodies to enforce stricter laws that mandate water companies stop polluting our rivers and seas with sewage. By signing this petition, you are contributing towards preserving England’s natural beauty and ensuring a safer environment for future generations.\nPlease click here to sign this petition today; let us together demand cleaner waters for England\nThis petition is promoted by Cllr Laura Manston on behalf of the South East Green Party, both at PO Box 78066, London SE16 9GQ.",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the International Energy Agency and the United Nations have all made clear there can be no new fossil fuel projects if there is to be any chance of keeping global temperature rises under 1.5 degrees – a goal that the UK signed up to as part of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nAn extraordinary decision as the world heats up to temperatures not seen in over 100,000 years and with many parts of the world on fire!\nCloser to home, and despite opposition from the South Downs National Park Authority, the Government’s Planning Inspectorate has just given permission for oil pumping to recommence at Avington, northeast of Winchester. The plans show that highly polluting gases associated with the oil pumping, including methane, are simply going to be released into our air.\nOil extraction activity at Avington is wholly inappropriate set against both Winchester City Council and Hampshire County Council’s carbon neutrality ambitions and is inconsistent with the City Council’s Jan 2023 motion to oppose initiatives to expand fossil fuel use and extraction.\nThe only way to effectively and sustainably reduce people’s bills, tackle the climate crisis and create millions of jobs for the future is to invest in insulating people’s homes, invest in a rapid rollout of electric heat pumps, invest in cheap and accessible public transport, and massively ramp up renewable energy.\nThe solutions are already there. The Government is choosing to ignore them and expand oil and gas instead. An expensive and morally reprehensible decision that will make life harder for everyone.",

Malcolm Wallace’s proposal\nAt the Winchester City Council meeting earlier this week (06-July) Councillors voted to improve protections on our local rivers and waterways by taking account of the cumulative impact of pollution.\nIn a first for Winchester, Green Councillor Malcolm Wallace proposed a motion to address this issue, then worked collaboratively with Liberal Democrat and Conservative colleagues to finalise the motion, which was then unanimously agreed by the Council. The motion means that, amongst other actions, planning applications for major developments should now include the effect on watercourses in their assessments.\nMalcolm Wallace, who is Green Party councillor for Central Meon Valley, said: “Winchester district residents are deeply concerned about water quality. The build-up of sewage, agricultural waste and plastic is polluting the waters of many of our rivers and waterways. Not a single river in our District has received a clean bill of health for chemical contamination and yet water companies appear to be dumping untreated or partially treated sewage in rivers on a regular basis. Although there are long term commitments, there are no plans in place which will address the immediate unacceptable situation either locally by Southern Water or by national government.”\n“It is beyond the authority of Winchester Council to resolve these issues in their entirety, however by enforcing a review of the potential for new developments to affect sewage outflow into watercourses, this motion is aimed at stopping the problem from getting any worse. Without action, the increasing levels of untreated sewage will continue to damage not only human health but natural habitats and local wildlife.”\nNotes\nContact: Cllr Malcolm Wallace, mwallace@winchester.gov.uk, 07739 050224 Malcolm is available for interview and to provide further information on this\npioneering approach to making Water companies and developers come clean on the impact of new developments on sewage discharges into local rivers and waterways.[1] Full motion approved by Winchester City Council, see Agenda for Council on\nWednesday, 6th July, 2022, 7.00 pm – Winchester City Council\n[2] Data from The Rivers Trust show that Southern Water discharged sewage into\nrivers and waterways in the Winchester district over 250 times in 2021, totalling over 3,500 hours of sewage discharge in just one year\n[3] Malcolm Wallace was elected in May 2022 and is the first Green Party Councillor on Winchester City Council.\n[wpforms id=”2140″]",

By following the above link, you are able to ‘have your say’ as individuals. Public consultation has been extended to 1st.September 2023.\nour response..\n‘We write to oppose the changes you are proposing to make on South Western Railways and in particular to the changes at Winchester station. The station is heavily used by residents and tourists and it would be represent a deterioration of the service to close the remaining office. The closure of the office on the London-bound platform was not welcome – it was used a lot during peak times; but to close the main office on the South-bound platform would be an enormous loss. Your consultation states that 75% of tickets are purchased online or through vending machines – what of the remaining 25%? This is a significant number of passengers who will be unable to purchase tickets, or will struggle with purchasing the correct ticket. Our objections stem from the need to provide universal, accessible, reliable, safe public transport. Removing the ticket offices is not in the interest of passengers and will not improve services. It is shortsighted, short-termist measure which will reduce accessibility and use of the rail service. The claim that stations will have the same numbers or increases in numbers of “multi-skilled” staff is doubtful. We already see many times at weekends and evenings, or during periods of staff sickness when the station is either unstaffed or staffed by contractors (who do not know anything about tickets or journey planning).\nAt present ticket offices are the only form of regulated station staffing, and if those are removed train companies will be under no statutory obligation to provide staff – and it is easy to imagine that numbers of staff will dwindle over time. The ticketing system is currently extremely complicated and the ticket office is the only way to ensure that passengers are able to access the appropriate and best value fare for their journey. Some products and services are not available either online or using the vending machines such as permission to travel, refunds, some discounts, connections with buses & ferries. Online services do not provide all route options, favouring the more expensive in many cases. Accessibility for disabled people will be greatly reduced and there has been widespread opposition from disability campaign groups. These changes as presented will result in reduced accessibility. Have equality impact assessments been carried out at every station to ensure that there is no discrimination? Please reconsider this in the context of passenger safety, accessibility, value for money and overall quality of experience. We need to be encouraging more people to use public transport in order to reduce carbon emissions. Retrograde steps such as closing station offices will prejudice this’.",

Via its website https://flightfree.co.uk it offers the public an opportunity to take a pledge not to fly for one year – or for life.\nBy the time COVID lockdowns struck, 6,800 pledges had been made, and more thousands continue to come in.\nWe need to challenge the idea that flying is a normal way to travel, a lifestyle choice. The vast majority of humanity do not have such a choice.\nAnna made a distinction between flying for leisure , flying in order to maintain family contact, and flying that has a necessary purpose. There are many alternatives for holiday travel and travel agencies that specialise in flight-free options.\nWe need to be aware of the disproprtionate carbon footprint of flying, eg a flight to Bali would consume your carbon “ration” for a year, and a transatlantic flight has more emissions per person than not driving for a year or not eating meat for a year.\nGovernment proposals for reducing the environmental impact of flying do not include taxing aviation fuel, instead they revolve around “sustainable” fuel, offsetting and techno solutions not yet discovered.

The cost of\nunnecessary mowing for example and wrong focus means avoidable inefficiency and David would\nlike to see a Green agenda come to the fore that will deliver a more effective management of\nresources and work power that doesn’t waste money whilst simultaneously delivering a\nsympathetic Green policy.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMax Priesemann\nBadger Farm & Oliver’s Battery\nOliver’s Battery, like many other places in the South of Winchester, is a great community\nclose to the countryside. People here worry about the pollution of our rivers, litter in\nour countryside, air pollution and noise as well as the light pollution from the nearby\nM3 compound.\nI pledge to protect our beautiful countryside from ever increasing threats from unwanted\ndevelopments like the application for a new industrial and retail estate at the former\nBushfield Camp. This plan will harm the area that had been left alone for many decades.\nWe will lose wonderful views and important habitats and it will create an extra 4000+ daily\ncar journeysalong Badger Farm Road.\nWinchester needs to be much smarter when planning new developments!\nI propose:\n- Only build what the community needs. (No to posh overpriced houses that normal\npeople can’t afford.) - Develop only on real brownfield sites near the city centre\n- Connect housing, public services, work and retail planning for communities (avoid\nsleeping ghettos) - Get the infrastructure right: Harvest rainwater, Build sufficient sewage treatment\nworks - Stop sealing off surfaces that will increase flooding\nI have been a campaigner to improve accessibility of Badger Farm Road junctions for many\nyears but current councillors have not achieved any improvements.\nI want to see more and better bus connections connecting Hursley, Compton, Olivers Battery\nand Shawford with Winchester reliably so that we don’t have to rely on our cars all the time.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRichard Cannon\nBishop’s Waltham\nRichard moved from Ashford in Kent to Bishop’s Waltham six years ago.\nHe is passionate about wildlife and nature and has seen the terrible demise in population of many\ncreatures caused by poor agricultural policies,loss of habitat, woodland and climate change.\nBeing a keen walker and Wildlife Photographer has given him the pleasure of speaking to many\npeople hearing the many issues and concerns they have.\nRoad noise, pollution and safety are a priority issue along with ensuring local business’s are\nsupported and our Countryside is maintained\nand improved where needed.\nRichard states “Our Village, our County, our Country and Planet are in urgent need of\nenvironmental change and putting wrongs to rights.\nWe must act now and the Green Party are the Party who will do just that, our many Councillors\naround the Country have been extremely successful in changing things for the good”.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSuzanne White\nCentral Meon Valley\nSuzanne has lived in Hampshire for over twenty years and moved to Soberton in the Meon Valley\nthree years ago.\nShe worked for sixteen years as a primary school teacher in a Hampshire school and more recently\nran a gardening service, helping older residents to comfortably stay in their own homes and\nacting as a point of contact to combat loneliness and isolation.\nShe is passionate about caring for our local environment and has spent many years taking part in\npractical conservation work, including maintaining our rare wildflower meadows and local pond\nas well as monitoring the health of the River Meon. She has set up a ‘Climate Action Group’ to\nprovide advice and information on sustainable living and facilitate projects that will benefit\nthe people living in the local area.\nIf elected as a Winchester City councillor, she is looking forward to working with Cllr Malcolm\nWallace and Cllr Danny Lee to achieve even more for local residents and businesses in\nthe Meon Valley.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nElizabeth Riley\nDenmead\nElizabeth has lived in the Meon Valley since 2007, and in Denmead since 2014. She joined the\nGreen Party many years ago in responseto the lack of action on climate change, this has only been\ndiluted since. Having worked in the education sector for over seventeen years, she has a strong\nidea of the issues that our young people are concerned about and the future they face if we do\nnot do better now!\nIn recent years, all aspects of our lives and the impact this is having on our natural world\nare on a downward slide andthis needs to change.\nAs a society, we can no longer continue to put profit before everything else. As a result of\nthe current climate, she has decided to put herself forward for a position where she can make\na difference.\nDoing what one can at home is no longer enough to affect change.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCharlotte Harley\nSt. Barnabas\nI have been a member of the Green Party since 2019 and having grown up in Winchester, I am\npassionate about putting Green issues at the forefront of council policies.\nI love spending time with my family in and around our beautiful City. My priority is to\nensure that new buildings and developments are designed with the environment and local\ncommunity front of mind, and that businesses meet their environmental responsibilityto protect\nand preserve the natural environment and its resources.\nI’m committed to ensuring that families and young people have access to safe green spaces and\nthat these are protected and maintained so everyone has access, and the opportunity, to enjoy\nand reconnect with the natural world.\nMy focus is to implement conscious and sustainable changes which will create a greener city\nand thriving community, with a commitment to the natural world and future generations.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\nLorraine Estelle\nSt. Bartholomew\nLorraine Estelle Abraham lives in Winchester and is a volunteer guide, showcasing the beauty\nand history of our cathedral to visitors.

I could see that the Green party was the only party not subject\nto the vested interests of the oil industry and big agricultural interests.\nI am standing as a candidate for the WCC election to support the good work that Green Party\nCouncillors Malcolm Wallace and Danny Green have been doing for our communities.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRichard Needham\nSt. Michael\nRichard joined the Green Party because of their policies to protect the environment and for\nsocial justice. He wants his children and grandchildren to grow up and enjoy a happy future\nand he believes that ‘The future is Green or not at all’.\nRichard grew up in a village and he understands the unique benefits and issues of village life.\nHe is a keen environmental campaigner and would be a strong voice to speak up for local residents.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nGiles Gooding\nSt. Paul\nI have lived in Fulflood for more than 20 years and have been actively involved in the local\ncommunity for most of this time.\nI volunteer with the Winchester Scouts and campaign on green issues with Friends of the Earth,\nWinACC and GreeningFulflood and also launched Freecycle Winchester in 2006.\nThe City of Winchester is choked by cars affecting the heath of its residents and visitors.\nMuch has been promised to reduce traffic but little has been delivered.\nThe Council needs to increase its Green Voice to get the Movement Strategy back on track and\nprioritise pedestrians and bicycles over cars. I want to see a cleaner, healthier, fairer\nWinchester for all.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\nBeata Parry\nSouthwick & Wickham\nI have been a resident of Swanmore since 2010. Before then I lived and raised my 5 children in\nthe beautiful Blue Mountains, NSW Australia – an area declared as a World Heritage Site. Living\nin such a wonderful place inspired me to appreciate nature and wildlife and strive to protect it.\nI enjoy gardening – growing my own vegetables & fruit, using composting to help recycle waste and\nimprove the soil, planting to provide friendly environments for wildlife.\nI am also a keen walker, observing the magic of seasonal changes & how it affects growth and\nhabitats. Spending so much time outdoors made me realise how precious our planet is and how much\nit is changing. We all need to make more efforts to protect it. I feel strongly about reducing\ncar pollution, eliminating chemicals from gardens & plastic in our homes.\nI am hoping to educate the next generations to reuse rather than buy new, recycle what we\nalready have and reduce the amount of plastic, artificial fibres, etc. in everyday use.\nI believe the Green Party is the only party fully committed to make these changes.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nKate Needham\nWhiteley & Shedfield\nWe are in a climate and biodiversity emergency. Local services have been cut and we have lost\nso much. I worry about what the future will be like for my grandchildren. I would like them to\nbe able to paddle in the sea and local streams without fear of becoming sick. I’d like them\nto breathe cleaner air and be surrounded by more green spaces and nature.\nTo be able to cycle more safely and to be able to afford to live here when they are older.\nWe need to vote more greens into positions of power and influence in order to take action now\nfor a greener, fairer world and a future we can all look forward to.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDee Wright\nWonston & Micheldever\nI’m Dee, the youngest Green candidate for Winchester City Council, at just 18 years old and\nI’m currently in college, getting ready to sit my A-level exams.\nBecause I am young, I have a personal stake in the environment – it’s my future, and it’s the\nfuture of our communities. I’ve spent the last 2 years sitting within the UK Youth Parliament\ntackling a variety of issues in partnership with councils: taking meetings with key decision\nmakers on mental health; jobs and opportunities; and education; alongside creating an\neco-conference for Hampshire’s school children, empowering them to improve their areas.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nAndrew Pogson\nThe Worthys\nI have been interested in Green Polices and Politics since studying Meteorology at University.\nI moved to Kings Worthy three years ago and since then I’ve spent many hours exploring the\nwonderful surrounding countryside alongside my two Labradors.\nEven in this short time I have seen many changes that are concerning to me. The challenge\nof building for a sustainable future is particularly relevant here, where we must find ways\nto preserve our city’s heritage and natural environment.\nBy thinking more long term and planning with the bigger picture in mind. We can protect our\nlocal environment, boost our local economy and improve peoples quality of life. That is why I\nam proud to represent the Green Party this May.",

Transport as one of the largest emitters has\nmore to do than most and targeting a 10% reduction is underwhelming and wholly inadequate. It is disappointing that the Climate is not mentioned once in the WMS.\nWe agree with the three priorities outlined by the WMS but don’t feel the Next Steps will deliver the large emission reduction required to meet the net zero targets.\nProposals:\n1. Improve P&R facilities on Andover Road. We disagree with this proposal because P&R is expensive and encourages driving from other areas. It attracts people that would have probably parked in out of town car parks anyway. The money would be better spent on thebuses servicing surrounding villages so visitors wouldn’t need a car at all. Disagree\n2. Changes to car parking in Winchester city centre. The proposals suggest increased parking charges which we support but this will not stop anyone able to pay so will have little effect.\nTo deter people from driving into town looking for a parking space we support the removal of car parks (leaving some spaces for blue badge holders). Parking charges should also be\nincreased for residential permits and exponentially for 2 and subsequent cars registered at an address. Support\n3. Converting eastern parts of the one way system. We do not support this proposal because it should be unnecessary if traffic is reduced by other stronger methods. We feel it would be expensive to implement and easy access to car parks will actually encourage more cars.\nMaking the street two way will prevent bus priority and safe cycling/walking measures being introduced here. We are unsure why you think it will make cycling easier. Disagree\n4. Create better public spaces. We support this proposal but feel it can only happen on St Georges Street and Jewry Street once there is a large reduction in traffic. Support\n5. Creating a high-quality walking route. We support this proposal but why is it limited to just one of the 13 routes in the City of Winchester Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP). Walking routes need to be safe and away from busy highways to avoid pollution.\nOther proposed routes allowing access to all areas of Winchester need to be revived.\nPavements need to be safe and trip free for all people to use. Support\n6. Creating safe cycle routes. We support this in principal but to encourage large numbers of cyclists to deliver the reduced traffic it will require high quality safe cycle routes providing direct, convenient routes to destinations. This should be a mixture of dedicated cycle lanes and roads that are not car priority. Simply painting a cycle symbol on an existing road will not\nhelp. Support\n7. Providing bus priority on key routes. We support Investment in public transport and in particular getting buses into the city centre faster than cars. Bus lanes and retractable bollards that sink into the ground for buses preventing cars from using the road. Buses have to be better and quicker than cars. Support\n8. Improve local bus services. We support improvements to bus routes including additional and more frequent services. It is a priority for a cheap, regular service from all areas of the district into the city. This will increase the numbers of buses travelling through Winchester so it is essential other traffic is reduced. There is no mention of a bus station which we think is a\nmistake. Relying on street bus stops for all the new services will restrict space for safe\nwalking and cycling. Support\n9. Improving deliveries into the city centre. We support improvements to freight delivery that reduce emissions and hope by removing car traffic there will be less conflict with deliveries anyway. Loading bays will keep these vehicles from blocking roads and reduce illegal\npavement parking. Support\n10. Setting up a freight delivery hub. We support a delivery hub which will consolidate deliveries made by electric bike or van. This goes for bulk deliveries into town but is just as appropriate for larger, heavier purchases delivered home or to a car park further out of town. Deliveries by cargo bike will require better cycle infrastructure and we shouldn’t rule out deliveries arriving by rail. The location of any hub needs to consider all these options. Support\nOverall we support the WMS but don’t believe that in its current form it has any hope of reducing traffic by any significant amount which is required. Fundamentally if you want to reduce traffic you\nhave to implement deterrents while at the same time offer a quality alternative. Massive public transport expansion is essential and it won’t happen by building P&R car parks or waiting for bus companies to put on more services. It requires additional sources of money. The Bus Back Better funding was entirely insufficient for this and has now been cut by a third. Councils have a lot of\noptions available to them which should be considered:\n● Close city centre car parks (leaving some spaces for blue badge holders). This is the most\nimportant and is something the WCC has promised in the past. Money can be raised for their subsequent reuse.\n● Increase the cost of residential parking permits from the 2nd and subsequent permit per household.\n● Car Clubs with cars available in residential areas. Focus on the 2nd household car which\nspends most of its time stationary. If everyone lived within 5 minutes of a car club they might\nnot invest in a 2nd car.\n● Councils have the power to introduce a workplace parking levy.\n● Free public transport systems are being introduced in various cities around the world but at the very least we would call for free bus passes for young people under 26. If they had free transport, they would be less likely to invest in a car",

Waste Disposal teams empty our bins and take it all away from our doorstep’\nBut what happens next? Councillor Malcolm Wallace gets literally hands on to investigate on our behalf\nMalcolm visited a local recovery centre in Portsmouth, to see the process. These facilities can handle 157,000 tonnes of recyclables each year. Our wheelie bin recyclables (mainly plastics, papers and tins) are sorted using a mix of technology and manual checks. The sorted materials are sent to specialist companies that create raw materials for new products. So what about the waste from black bins that can’t be recycled? This is mostly transferred to local energy recovery centres and burned to produce electricity. These facilities can output enough power for 53,000 homes. Collected garden waste is converted locally into soil conditioner and sold at every recycling centre. Malcolm says, “Did you know that less than 5% of Hampshire’s household waste goes to landfill – but we still need to do better to reduce waste incineration!” What’s your experience with local refuse and recycling collections? Please let us know.\nYou can read the full version of above in our November-December 2022 NEWSLETTER",

We have food and cleaning products in bulk that customers can fill their own tubs with, negating the need for new packaging each time they shop. We also stock an ever-growing range of plastic free homeware and personal care products. I started this business because I wanted to reduce my own harmful impact and I was trying to live a low waste lifestyle at home. After a while, I set about trying to find a way that I could offer others a place to shop this way more easily.\nQ: Are the public ready to purchase and shop ecologically? What are the differences, challenges, and advantages of this new way of shopping?\nI believe that people are ready and they’re willing to make it part of their habits. There is growing concern around plastic pollution, not just for those that study nature but everyone has some awareness now and would like to do their bit. The two main advantages of shopping with us is reduced plastic and food waste of course, but we are also comparable to the supermarket in terms of pricing. The challenge can be taking the first step, but fortunately this is often a lot easier than people imagine it to be.\nKatie chatting over a product with Winchester Green Party Joint Co-ordinator, Kate Needham\nQ: How do you see the future of your business and eco-shopping?\nImproving the ethical and sustainable standards of our business is our immediate goal. This year and beyond we aim to become carbon neutral and zero waste to landfill. We would like to grow in size to be able to offer more variety, at the moment we are limited by space but these things will come in time. Beyond our own shop, I’d like to see eco-friendly shopping become normal practice rather than something niche. It needs to be more accessible, but that should also come with higher standards that prevent greenwashing.\nQ: What do you think local or national government should be doing to help environmentally focused retailers such as yourselves?\nWe are all trying to do the best we can, as community groups, small businesses and as individuals but this is independent of our governments actions. We need a more joined up approach to sustainability and a willingness from leadership to make bigger, more actionable change. In terms of supporting eco-focused retailers, we struggle with the same issues that all independent businesses do. In recent years there have been a huge number of challenges to overcome, and the support has been noticeably lacking, even though SMEs make up 99% of the GDP!\nEarthian is at 9a Parchment St. Winchester – Visit their website HERE\nWe often hear ecological green product and service reviews from the point of view of the consumer. So it was great to hear an eco-retailers point of view and perspective on bringing more environmentally sound products to our shopping bag, and the challenges and opportunities they face. For sure the way we shop, and the way retailers sell will change, from products, to packaging, to packing avoidance, to purchasing. People like Katie are quietly driving the future of shopping with one eye firmly on our environment and what and how we consume, when in Winchester go and visit Earthian and check it out for yourself. A positive green highlight, shops like this are thankfully leading the way. Thanks Katie.",

Very few politicians can claim to have changed the course of the national debate in the way Caroline has. She has brought so much to us as a party, shown real integrity in her work and added a crucial dimension to our democracy in this country.\nHaving MPs who are genuinely dedicated to standing up for the climate and nature could not be more important than it is right now and that’s why we are striving to get more Green MPs elected at the next General Election so that we can build on Caroline’s achievements.” – Adrian Ramsay\nIf you would like thank Caroline, you can do so here, we know that so many of you have also been inspired by her.\nYou can also sign up to hear more about how you can get involved in the key constituencies where we are primed to win our next MPs.

Winchester Green Party have been one of main local organisations that have been petitioning the Fund to move away from investment in fossil fuels and, in September, several members picketed outside Hampshire County Council offices at a protest organised by Hampshire Pension Fund Divest.\nTherefore, it was welcome news that at the Winchester Council meeting last week a motion was passed recognising that Hampshire Pension Fund’s approach to fossil fuel investment needs to change. The leader of the Council will now write to the board of the fund to ask them to commit to divesting their fossil fuel equities and instead seek to invest in companies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, minimise climate risk and where possible provide local environmental benefits.\nCllr Danny Lee, who supported the motion, stated, ‘From insulating heat-leaking homes to facilitating mass public transport, councils are key to effect climate action, but this is undermined if local authority pension funds continue to fund fossil fuels. The climate crisis isn’t going away. It’s time to ditch financially risky holdings in gas, coal and oil, and invest in accelerating the transformation to a carbon-free future’.\nCllr Lee also proposed an amendment for the Council to consider the creation of a Green Fund for investment in Hampshire-wide ‘green’ projects. Although this amendment was not passed, it could be considered at a later date and is an opportunity to accelerate local investment.\nSee also\nWinchester Emissions and Carbon Neutrality Action >>\nOil drilling at Cheesefoot Farm – accererating climate change >>",

  "https_winchester_greenparty_org_uk/https_winchester_greenparty_org_uk_2023_12_06_objection-to-bushfield-development-application/content_116.html": "a copy of our full letter explaining the reasons for our objection\nBushfield army camp, once an emergency measure in WW2 that returned to the Church Commissioners about 40 years later, has since been rewilding itself for nearly 45 years. There have been multiple attempts for developing this site until the newest proposal.\nThe application states: The proposed uses are as follows: office (Class E), research and development (Class E), academic uses and academic accommodation (Class F1/Sui Generis) a hotel (Class C1) and other complementary/ancillary uses including a nursery (Use Class E), retail uses including shops (Use Class E) restaurants/cafes/bars (Use Class E), visitor space/exhibition space (Class F1), leisure and sports uses (Use Class F2).\nWe are very worried about these plans as:\nLocals doubt there is a need for these proposals,\nConstruction and increased traffic from estimated 4000+ car daily car journeys (two multistorey carparks with 1055 parking spaces included) will increase carbon emissions,\nThe increase in car traffic will make it more difficult to cycle and to cross the road on Badger Farm Road near Sainsbury’s, further along the way including on Romsey Road and St Cross Road,\nThreaten this area’s biodiversity, an area that has been left to rewild for longer than it was used as an army camp and that is now a habitat for dormice and valued wildlife,\nThe visual impact from multistorey buildings may reach far into South Downs NP and impact the surrounding heritage,\nNoise and light pollution will impact on nature and locals.\nFurthermore, there is concern that an outline planning permission once granted will take control away from local councils when further changes to the plans are made in the future.\nIt appears that the plans do not conform with the 2013 Local Plan, nor the Carbon Neutrality Action Plan. It is contrary to the WCCs and the Church of England’s Carbon Net Zero 2030 target as well as the UK Government’s Net Zero Development Plan. It also contradicts Winchester’s recently announced Nature Emergency.\nYou can find the planning application on www.winchester.gov.uk/planning by searching for the reference 23/02507/OUT. This is where you can make any comments and object. Here are some tips on how to give your objection extra impact:\nGive clear reasons for your objection\nExplain from your own viewpoint why you want to preserve the Bushfield area\nRefer your objections to policies included below\nFind further details below and make use of links attached to get help\nWho is behind this?\nWe understand that this land belongs to the Church Commissioners for England. In partnership with Legal & General and Gisborne they have organised several consultations that led to this outline planning application.\nWho is this development for?\nLocals have been very critical at meetings in the neighbouring Badger Farm parish about this engagement and how the proposed buildings and their function changed over the last 2 years. A petition has gained much attention this year.\nThe site was allocated in the 2013 Winchester District Local plan (Policy WT3) as an ’employment site’ and has since been included in the Regulation 18 Local Plan – Winchester Town Development Allocations as ‘high quality flexible business and employment space, an innovation/education hub and creative industries’. Student accommodation, a hotel and retail do not fit with this description. This location, isolated from the city centre, is not suitable for student accommodation. Why do we need student accommodation at this site if the Uni of Winchester is not interested in such? Furthermore, there is fear that it would create extra pressures on the Badger Farm surgery and possibly other public services.\nLocals claim that there are empty spaces for business available closer to the city centre and in the Winnall business estate. It is highly unlikely that it will attract people from Winchester who commute to London to work in these premises that are planned here. The number of job vacancies in Winchester in comparison to the size of this development suggests that this site would have to attract people to commute from elsewhere which is not of any use for people living in Winchester.\nFinally, it appears unlikely to attract businesses outside the Solent Freeport and we can not see that this has been taken into account.\nSite Allocation and Emerging Planning Policy\nThe Bushfield Camp site is allocated in the current adopted Local Plan (LPP1) under Policy WT3 as an employment site. The Applicant has stated that “The Regulation 18 Local Plan includes new policy wording which seeks to recognise the changing nature of employment uses. The draft policy for Bushfield (draft WT5) now supports a high quality flexible business and employment space, an innovation/education hub and creative industries”. In our view the emerging Local Plan does not hold weight or provide ‘direction of travel’ as the Regulation 19 consultation is not due to be published until the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Applicant has stated that “…the adopted Policy WT3 does not list out specific use classes that the development must align with, nor does it preclude the provision of other uses (supporting hotel accommodation, leisure, or education facilities etc.) which are all employment generating uses”. In our view, the proposed use of the site diverges significantly with the adopted policy. We contend that Policy WT3 permits the construction of a 100 bedroom hotel and 525 bed student village.\nThe Applicant has referenced emerging Local Plan Policy H9 (Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA)). We contend that this policy also does not hold weight regarding this application. The policy is not applicable as the proposed student village is not PBSA and the application has not demonstrated a shortfall in accommodation from an existing education provider.\nAs the proposed development does not comply with policy and site allocation requirements and represents a significant departure from the Local Plan. It is our view that the LPA must notify the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister of this departure if it intends to approve the application.Proposed Site Use\nThe Spatial Strategy within the Local Plan states that the allocation of land at Bushfield Camp is provided to realise the aspiration for Winchester to “diversify its economy through the promotion of its creative and cultural industries, linked to its Universities”. In our view the proposals, which are for a large-scale major development, do not align with this aspiration, or what could be classed creative and cultural industries and rather than evidencing links with local universities, the plans propose global affiliations with leading corporations.\nPolicy WT3 requires that “any development should deliver necessary social, economic or environmental development which could not otherwise be accommodated within or around Winchester…”. We contend that due to the contraction of the public sector, changes due to increasing numbers of people working from home, and sites needing redevelopment, that the proposed development would be better located within the city centre, and not a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation and within proximity of the Compton Street Local Settlement Gap.\nLocal Plan Policy WT3 requires that the development “does not compete or detract from the town centre, is compatible with the provision made elsewhere through this strategy, and reflects other policy statements prepared by the Council including the Vision for Winchester”. In our view, the development will detract from the city centre, especially the proposed hotel, which is likely to compete with hotels in the town centre. Our view is supported by the NPPF and Policy DM7 – “hotels should normally be directed towards the town centre in the first instance”. Neither Policy WT3 nor emerging draft Policy WT5 permits the development of a hotel.\nThe Applicant has stated that the “NPPF seeks to ensure a sufficient choice of education places are available ‘to meet the needs of existing and new communities'”. In our view, the NPPF is not applicable as the development is not aimed at meeting local education needs\nIncreased car traffic\nThe application fails to address the scale of transport Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions it will cause. The reference to CP10 is meaningless without more practical proposals that address more usefully the growing urgency of climate policies. Many key policies are overlooked and their implications ignored.\nWCC must reduce all emissions sharply to achieve net zero by 2030 and transport emissions are nearly half of these.\nCompared with 2022, the modelling suggests traffic volumes will increase by between 17% to 37% on roads around the development by 2039. The application does not attempt to show how the increase due to the development itself can be limited neither to help achieve the WCC net zero target by 2030, nor even to achieve the government’s Net Zero Development Plan target of reducing 2022 emissions by 76% to 85% by 2039.\nNo attempt has been made to quantify the extent transport emissions associated with this development will undermine Winchester’s Carbon Neutrality Action Plan (CNAP). Using government conversion factors we calculate that the modelled increase in traffic will produce 6.15 KtCO2e extra emissions annually. To achieve net zero emissions by 2030 there will have to be overall cumulative reductions of 67 KtCO2e in Winchester District transport emissions each year until 2030. As this proposal increases traffic related carbon emissions, further reduction would need to be found elsewhere.\nThe Sustainability Statement makes a number of vague proposals that are relatively unformed and weak about mitigating the damage caused by increased transport emissions but does not demonstrate satisfactorily the extent to which these proposals will contribute to emissions reduction.\nThe framework travel plan has no targets for increasing the share of EVs. The proposals include plans for a “…minimum of 3kW chargers for at least a quarter of total car parking spaces, with an aspiration to provide 100% EV charging capacity in the future.” Parking for 8 hours on site would only charge the average EV by less than half of its battery capacity. This is clearly not in line with government plans to increase EV use.\nThe traffic modelling suggests there will be about 4500 daily journeys to and from the site. There are plans for 1050 parking spaces. It is difficult to reconcile these two figures. The proposals do not appear to be coherent.\nImpact on active travel\nThe framework travel plan has no targets for achieving modal transfer to increase the share of walking, cycling and public transport access.\nIt appears that the applicant has not fulfilled the obligation under the Local Plan: “Promotion of non-vehicular access to and within the site, to ensure integration with the surrounding areas and to minimise and mitigate its impact on the strategic highway network.”\nGiven the very large scale of the development with projected 8399 trips per day (Transport Assessment, section 5.4), the applicant needs to invest more to increase the low number of 212 anticipated daily cycle trips. We agree with Active Travel England that the modal share targets (car/van 79.7%, walking 5.7%, cycling 3.2%, bus 3.6%, and train 2.0%) are unambitious. Instead, the plans should be in line with the government target for 50% of short journeys in towns and cities to be walked, wheeled or cycled by 2030.\nAny permission for development of the site must be conditional on meeting LTN 1/20 standards for the main cycle path.\nTo the North:\nThe proposed cycle route from the Bushfield roundabout via the site to the north is welcomed but an unsealed surface as suggested would make this less suitable for cycling given the gradient. An unsealed surface makes cycling more dangerous around sharp bends together with a significant gradient due to its terrain. There are concerns that the path will not be wide enough to minimise conflict with pedestrians. A high-quality route would have a sealed surface and environmentally-sensitive lighting (to allow year-round use) and be sufficiently wide to avoid conflict with pedestrians.\nThe main site cycle path terminates at the northern site boundary, near the railway footbridge to Whiteshute Lane. There are no plans included on how this path will link towards the centre of Winchester. For these plans to be in accordance with the Local Plan funds and agreements should be included to provide these onward links.\nTo the West (Badger Farm and Olivers Battery):\nPlans to link with neighbouring residential areas of Badger Farm and Olivers Battery, including a supermarket, GP and dentist, are not satisfying and at best useful for leisure purposes. These paths become muddy and overgrown and are not suitable for commuting to work by cycle or walking for shopping purposes.\nThe plans fail to provide for a cycle route as per LTN 1/20 nor a suitable route for pedestrians. A provision of these however would increase active travel.\nTo the South (Compton and Shawford):\nThe application fails to include adjustments for Bushfield roundabout to encourage safe cycling as per LTN 1/20 section 10.7 on roundabouts, 5.9 on horizontal curve radii, and Summary principle #18: “Cycle routes must flow, feeling direct and logical. Users should not feel as if they are having to double back on themselves, turn unnecessarily, or go the long way round. Often, cycling schemes – when crossing a main road, for instance – require cyclists to make a series of ninety-degree turns to carry out a movement that a motor vehicle at the same location could do without turning at all. Schemes should be based on a proper understanding of how people actually behave rather than how they might be expected to behave.”\nThis creates a deterrent to cycling. Instead, the applicants should develop a design that follows state of the art examples from the Netherlands or the Manchester model.\nThe proposed crossing of Badger Farm road is not safe for cyclists and pedestrians. It includes a refuge island built to “HCC Standard Detail HCC11/C/075 Type 8a” that is only suitable for pedestrians and only on roads with a 40mph speed limit or lower. It is not appropriate for a shared-use crossing that connects a bridleway to a shared-use path (used by cyclists, pedestrians, mobility scooters, wheelchairs, and equestrians), crossing a 60mph road. The crossing is equally unsafe for those who like to reach the bus stop on the other side of this busy road.\nWe are concerned about the lack of a footway and segregated cycle path along Badger Farm Road, given the high speeds and potential pedestrian traffic to the nearby Sainsbury’s supermarket.\nAlthough there are proposals for a private shuttle bus, it fails to provide details on how this is linked to other bus routes, what frequency there is planned throughout day and night and how it links to the P&R parking, supermarkets, train stations in Winchester and Shawford, schools etc. The design of the bus stops is poor with little or no shelter. Routes to current bus stops are difficult to reach via long and unpleasant routes, i.e. requiring crossing a busy roundabout to reach Otterbourne Road for the Blue Star bus.\nThe proposals should follow standards as stated in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 104, 110, 112, 113, as well as the National Design Guide (Paragraph 82, Planning practice guidance for beautiful, enduring and successful places, 2021): “Priority is given to pedestrian and cycle movements, subject to location and the potential to create connections. Prioritising pedestrians and cyclists means creating routes that are safe, direct, convenient and accessible for people of all abilities. These are designed as part of attractive spaces with good sightlines, and well-chosen junctions and crossings, so that people want to use them. Public rights of way are protected, enhanced and well-linked into the wider network of pedestrian and cycle routes.”\nIt is disappointing that this application concentrates primarily to accommodate access by car, instead of promoting most access by active travel, resulting in a major traffic increase estimated to at least 4500 extra car journeys a day. This is another reason for the planning application to be rejected.Brownfield or Greenfield\nThe whole site includes primarily greenfield and some brownfield with partially demolished buildings and some tarmacked roads and squares. We like to point out that the smaller brownfield area has rewilded during the last 40-50 years since the closure of the army camp. This is a longer period than the time it was used by the army.\nThe whole area has attracted locals for its value for walking in the countryside with great views towards St Catherine’s hill, St Cross Hospital and the Cathedral. Without doubt this supports their physical fitness and wellbeing.\nRisk to Biodiversity\nIt is well known that brownfield, if left alone over decades as here, starts rewilding and can host a greater variety of wildlife then farmland which is usually labelled as greenfield. Many invertebrates have complex life cycles, needing different things at different stages, so they often require two or more habitats close to each other – a ‘mosaic’ of habitats. Brownfield sites are one of these precious mosaics in the wider landscape, providing habitat variety that is rare in the agricultural countryside. www.buglife.org.uk/resources/habitat-hub/brownfield-hub\nHazel Dormice, Common Lizards, Invertebrates and many bird species have been spotted on Bushfield land. The construction of this development, with construction ongoing for 11 years, will disturb their habitat and therefore contribute to the decline of threatened species within an ecosystem that has grown over more than 4 decades.\nDormice are known as a ‘flagship’ species, meaning that they are found in a habitat that is usually suitable for a wide range of other species too. The protection of dormice will help to protect species such as the common lizard, slow worm, badger, warblers, fieldfare, tawny and little owl, and woodpecker.\nThe data to describe the ecological value of Hazel Dormice appears to be out of date as it is based on the 17 year old Conservation Handbook when Hazel Dormice was more common. The State of Dormice Report 2023 however concludes that “dormice are locally extinct in 14 English counties within their historical range; in a further six they are known only from reintroduced populations”. The State of Britain’s Dormice Report 2023 states that “between 2000 and 2022, the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP) shows the population has fallen by 70 per cent”.\nThe development proposals state that there is 33.5ha of suitable dormouse habitat on site which is estimated to accommodate 13 individuals. The proposals include the removal of 7.43ha of confirmed and potential dormouse habitat, however only 2.28ha appears to be provided in compensation, which would cause a loss in habitat of 5.15ha. In addition, the activities linked to the development including noise and light pollution and an increase in human activity will further impact on the Hazel Dormice population as they are active at night.\nNatural England have stated in the paper ‘Definition of Favourable Conservation Status for Hazel or Common Dormouse’ that 12-13% increase in mixed deciduous woodland is required for the species to gain favourable conservation status. The developer should provide compensation for lost habitat due to the development (7.43ha), plus the recommended increase in suitable habitat (4.36ha), plus a quantified compensatory area of habitat due to the degradation of suitable existing dormouse habitat.\nThe habitat will need to replace like for like in terms of species and will need to connect to wider green infrastructure through linear hedgerows. In addition, proposals will need to compensate for the delay of the new habitat to become suitable due to the time it takes for planted shrubs and trees to bear fruits and flowers and for suitable links to grow between upper and lower canopies.\nThe plans state that vegetation removal will be carried out under ecological supervision and take place outside of the sensitive peak breeding season (June to August). However, it fails to protect the peak bird nesting season (March to July).\nIn our view the proposals do not comply with Section 15 of the NPPF (conserving and enhancing the natural environment), or Local Plan Policy CP16 or WT3, as the proposals fail to adequately protect or enhance or restore the Hazel Dormouse Habitat, or the onsite Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation. There is also likely to be significant recreational pressure on the River Itchen SAC and SSSI and St Catherines Hill SSSI from the proposed development. The proposed phasing also does not comply with Policy CP15 (Green Infrastructure) which requires that green infrastructure is provided at “the earliest feasible stage”, in our view the mitigated woodland and grassland habitat needs to be created years in advance of the habitat removal.\nPolicy WT3 requires development of the site to have a ‘conservation led approach’. In our view, the proposals, which include a 525 bed student village, 100 bed hotel, sports facilities, shops, cafés, and bars, which are to be built on land that is currently designated as a Site of importance for Nature Conservation, cannot be said to be a conservation led approach. The development is clearly too ambitious for the fragile ecology located on the site and is led purely by economic interests. The application admits that “Bushfield is an employment-led, mixed use development…” and that the applicant is seeking to get the “best possible return” on the site.\nFinally, WCC unanimously voted to support a motion to declare a Nature Emergency in September 2023 which underlines that this application should be rejected.Climate Change\nWinchester City council declared a climate emergency in 2019 with the aim for the wider district to be carbon neutral by 2030. The proposals in this application, however, are not in line with these plans. Construction and life cycle as well as all the impacts including traffic should be carbon neutral.\nVisual impact on South Downs NP\nThe planned development will be visible from the South Downs NP.\nNoise and light pollution\nThe plans will undoubtedly increase noise and light pollution during construction and afterwards. This would have a negative impact on locals. It will also change the habitat of sensitive wildlife. This is of particular concern to nocturnal animals like dormice.\nWater Supply and Wastewater\nWe worry that this development will put further strain on the overstretched water supply for Winchester. Water extraction from chalk aquifers is already at a limit that led Southern Waters to plan to recycle wastewater and revert it back from Waterlooville to Winchester. These plans fail to outline where the extra water for this development can be sourced from.\nDespite the possible inclusion of a water treatment works there remain concerns on where the water will be drained to. The extra volume of water, even if it was cleaner, would put extra strain on the mains sewer at Morestead WwTW which would increase the likelihood of so-called storm overspills.\nThere are details missing on the design of a Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) including evidence and reassurance that the proposed SuDS does not lead to deterioration in water quality affecting the Itchen and groundwater.\nObjection to Bushfield Development Application 23/02507/OUT\nWe like to see reassurance according to the motion unanimously supported by WCC in July 2022 “To protect our local rivers & waterways by taking account of the cumulative impact of pollution including sewage discharge”.Outline planning application\nWe are concerned that an outline planning application limits opportunities for the council and local people to participate in more detailed plans. The application seeks to exclude Access from the Reserved Matters, meaning that, if the application were accepted, there would be very limited scope for correcting errors and inadequacies introduced at this early stage.\nFurthermore, we reject that this application gives too little time for people to study the application in detail to be able to respond fully.\nAlternatives\nWe appreciate that the Church Commissioners as the owners of this land have a duty to look after the land and to get a return for their pension funds. However, they also follow an ethical policy which includes safeguarding God’s creation. The Church of England has agreed an ambitious goal to become carbon neutral by 2030.\nTherefore, this land could offer a prime opportunity to use the land as a carbon sink. This could include further rewilding and tree planting. The small brownfield land could be used for an installation of a combined solar and wind farm with combined energy storage while encouraging biodiversity.\nThe land could be used for educational purposes to observe and measure the rewilding process. Pupils from surrounding schools could learn about biodiversity, renewable energy etc. in a study centre like in Minstead in the New Forest.\nThe land could also offer room for a ‘Wild Church’ in the open.\nThese alternatives would benefit locals, be in keeping with church and local policies and provide an annual financial return for the Church Commissioners.\nSummary\nThis planning application should be rejected by WCC as it is in the wrong place, lacks benefits for the local community, contradicts recent plans to reduce carbon emissions, destroys habitat for species that are threatened by decline, fails to promote active travel modes, increases traffic congestion and will change the South of Winchester with its heritage sites forever.",

The motion was based on a Local Government Association initiative.\nCllr Malcolm Wallace, who supported the call for the ban, said, ‘Disposable vapes are an unsustainable product, so an outright ban is the best solution to the problem. They are very difficult to recycle without special treatment and so can end up littering our streets or going to landfill.’ A report by Material Focus in 2022 states that: 1.3 million single use vapes are thrown away every week or 5.4 million per month. While each vape contains just 0.15g of lithium, the scale of the waste means about 10 tonnes of the metal, equivalent to the batteries inside 1,200 electric vehicles, is ending up in landfills. As well as this, the vapes can be hazardous for waste collections as the lithium batteries can become flammable when crushed and cause bin lorry fires. Whilst the Council acknowledged the role vapes play in aiding adults to stop smoking, vapes are not risk free, especially to those who have never smoked. Cllr Danny Lee has been raising awareness about the effect vaping is having on children and young people. He states, ‘Several local parents have approached me with concerns about the health implications of vaping on their children. Many vapes are designed and marketed to appeal to children and we will continue to call for more regulation on the display and marketing of vaping products.’",

A Winchester Green Party Walk and Talk. Sitting high in the hills above Hambledon in the Meon Valley something special is happening, a coming together of people and planet via a passionate environment friendly farming family, the Crossley’s. It was a pleasure to attend a really informative Green Party Walk and Talk meeting with our superb host, George Crossley, a young next generation farmer, taking over running his family farm alongside his parents.\nClick photo for full size The Rushmere Farm focus is organic farming and carbon neutrality. This is no mere experiment this is business and as such has to turn a profit, the family turned their back on chemical farming and after a few years have now, credit to them, succeeded. The hard facts are that in Britain only a few percent of farmers are organic farmers, George took risks, yields initially dropped, costs rose, but now those years of investment are paying off, with better more nutritious respected products, and a local landscape benefiting. The Crossley’s are leading the way, more will follow as we all better understand the threats to our environment, and the benefits of healthier better quality food. After years of hard work transforming from traditional farming, Rushmere Farm is now carbon negative and has been officially recognised for its organic produce.\nGeorge is a wonderful champion of green agro-ecology, as you’ll see in the photos he has visitors engaged with his informative in-the-field presentations and has pertinent facts and data mentally to hand. He happily answers all our questions. When asked what he would like to see or hear from our political representatives, George mentions better clear labelling of our food so customers understand what they are purchasing, and continued vital support to allow organic farmers to be competitive. Local Green Party Councillors Malcolm Wallace and Danny Lee were on hand to listen and learn. The farm though primarily agriculture, has diversified.\nWe met at the farms workshops where presentations, workshops, and all manner of related meetings are held. We then (we were warned to bring our wellies) are led out around and onto the fields. George stops regularly to tell us what we’re looking at. We saw crops growing alongside wild flower patches, the flower strips are home to insects that keep other crop attacking insects at bay. I was surprised to learn that these predator insects are quite territorial and don’t fly far, thus the reason for integrating wild flower homes alongside crops. We are shown areas that are rested, and had the yield reductions explained alongside the offset cost reduction of not having to use expensive chemicals. We’re led into woodland where a surprise meets us, a woodland workshop where people come together to build furniture and socialise, this also for refugees and asylum seekers in association with Friends Without Borders and the British Red Cross.\nGeorge was bombarded with questions, we all share his obvious passion for farming, food, and our environment. It was a rare pleasure to have our questions patiently answered whilst surrounded by wheat waving in the falling evening sun after a day of heavy downpours. School was never like this, but perhaps it should be? Then we’d all have a real appreciation for the quality of food on our plates, how it got there, and the champions and guardians of our countryside who deserve our respect and support.

Studies have shown that by 2050 England would use up 104% of the country’s entire carbon budget on just building houses if building follows a business-as-usual approach. Therefore, it is vitally important that how we build houses changes, both to minimise the carbon impact of the building itself plus the on-going impact from heating our homes.\nThe draft Winchester Local Plan is scheduled to come out for public consultation from 02-Nov to 14-Dec and everyone is encouraged to provide their feedback. A separate SDNP Local Plan is being updated that covers the South Downs National Park and important to remember 40% of Winchester District is in SDNP.\nThe updated SDNP Local Plan is expected to come out for public consultation next year.\nMalcolm says: “The draft Winchester Local Plan is now out for public consultation until 14-Dec .

Any proposal to support or allow fracking, or the extraction of oil or gas in any form, goes against Winchester City Council’s plan and the Council’s Climate Emergency declaration.”Cllr. Malcolm Wallace’s introduction to the Motion in full:\n“The motion before the Council today is two-fold. Firstly, to oppose as a matter of council policy any initiatives to develop fracking for shale gas. Secondly, to respond to the County Council’s consultation on the refreshed Minerals and Waste Plan stating our opposition to fracking and to the extraction of oil and gas.\nCurrent Government policy is for a moratorium (or temporary prohibition) on fracking. However, as we have seen over the past few months, the Government position in this areais fluid. Therefore, it is important that this Council confirms Winchester’s position.\nAs you are aware, fracking is a way of extracting gas or oil which is trapped inside rocks. To get the gas or oil out, the rock has to be fractured. A mixture of water, sand and chemicals is pumped down the well at very high pressure. This fractures the rock and, when the pressure is released, the gas or oil flows back up the well.\nClick to watch Malcolm presenting his Motion to the Council in full (youtube)\nThere are many risks surrounding fracking:\nFracking risks contaminating water supplies – In England, groundwater is used to supply a third of our drinking water. According to the British Geological Survey,\n“Groundwater may be potentially contaminated by extraction of shale gas both from the constituents of shale gas itself, from the formulation and deep injection of water containing a cocktail of additives used for hydraulic fracturing and from flowback water which may have a high content of saline formation water.”\nFracking poses risks to public heath – In the UK, 20 leading medical experts\nwrote to the British Medical Journal stating that “the arguments against fracking on\npublic health grounds are overwhelming”.\nFracking poses a risk to the local environment – The area of landscape disturbed\nby fracking is typically 8 to 11 times that of conventional gas drilling.\nA draft Government report states that “shale gas development may transform a previously pristine and quiet natural region, bringing increased industrialisation”.\nFracking does not lead to a jobs boom – The 6-year proposed fracking project in\nLancashire was anticipated to create just 11 jobs at each of the two sites, according to the fracking company’s application. This includes on-site, indirect supply chain and induced effects.\nFracking is unlikely to reduce energy bills – Even Lord Browne, the former\nchairman of fracking firm Cuadrilla, said that UK shale gas would not have a material impact on gas prices.\nFracking in the UK has triggered many small earthquakes – More than 120\ntremors were recorded during drilling at a Cuadrilla site in Blackpool, including one\nwhich lasted almost 100 hours.\nFinally, and most importantly, fracking is incompatible with tackling climate\nchange. And this is the point that ties to the second part of the motion regarding\nopposing oil and gas development in our area.\nPolicy 24 of the draft Minerals and Waste Plan states that: Oil and gas development will be supported subject to environmental and amenity considerations. Frankly this position (even with the caveats) is shocking.\nIn May 2019 the UK Government declared a Climate Emergency. In June 2019 Hampshire County Council declared a Climate Emergency. And yet both groups are still producingpolicies that are contrary to these declarations.\nLast summer, the High Court found the UK Government’s climate strategy unlawful as it doesn’t show how the UK’s legally-binding carbon budgets (our Net Zero commitment) will be met. Now we have Hampshire County Council carrying on with a business as normal approach, ignoring the basic requirements for decarbonising our economy.\nScientists agree that if we are to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, the majority of fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground. At the same time, the Government’s own net zero review that was published last week identified the massive opportunities to both the economy and to communities from switching to clean, green energy.\nThere is absolutely no justification for further oil and gas development, and it is time that policies are put in place to support the transition that is needed.\nI propose this motion to Council and hope you will support it.”",

We note the parlous state of HCC’s\nfinances as a consequence of over a decade of austerity and budget cutting by the Conservative Government.\nThe Green Party supports a radical transformation of society for the benefit of all and for the planet. This budget is\nentirely focussed on economic growth and financial rectitude and does little to address or recognise the need to\nradically overhaul systems and structures in order to create economic, social and environmental wellbeing. External\ncosts resulting from the imposition of further draconian cuts are not reflected in this budget. Neither is there any\nattempt to reflect the value of natural capital or carbon accounting. On all of these bases we consider the budget\nprocess to be flawed.\nResponding specifically to each of your proposed measures:\n1. Lobbying\nWe strongly support sustained and effective lobbying. This should not be limited to lobbying the current\nconservative government (which has not listened and is the source of these problems) but should include opposition\nand cross party bodies; and working with the LGA to compel government to restore funding to enable society to\nfunction properly. We would also encourage HCC to lobby for an overhaul of the council tax system to make it\nprogressive depending on size and value per inhabitant.\n2. Using Council Reserves\nWe strongly support the use of Council reserves. These should be used now for gaps in the budget. The funds are for\nthe current population and should not be kept for future possible projects when core services are at risk. This is the\npriority source of income and should be the first port of call before any loss of service or reduction in\nquality/scope/scale.\nYour duty is to the residents of Hampshire now; beyond operational/insurance reserves, you should use the money\nyou have to fund the shortfall – this is the current populations entitlement, not that of future generations. It is\niniquitous to hold on to multi-million pound reserves while implementing measures which will cause deterioration of\nthe quality of life of Hampshire residents.\nYou have excluded transport capital projects from this consultation. We strongly support scrapping these projects.\nJust a year ago we found reference to the following transport project :\nApproves an increase in the scheme value for the M27 Junction 9 project within the Universal Services capital\nprogramme of £1.325m from £23.1m to £24.425m to be funded from a combination of developer contributions\n(£0.725m) and the corporate capital inflation risk reserve (up to £0.6m) pending the conclusion of funding discussions\nwith National Highways.\nThe Climate Change Committee 2022 Progress report recommended that the Department for Transport and National\nHighways must “rigorously assess the emissions impacts of [road-building] plans and thoroughly consider alternative\napproaches”. In the light of this and other clear evidence against road building in a climate emergency, this scheme,\nand other capital transport projects, should be cancelled, releasing much needed capital funds for plugging gaps and\nfor public transport projects instead.\n3. Generating income from services\nWe support the generation of income from services, if this is possible without prejudicing providing services to\nresidents.\n4. Introducing and increasing costs\nWe are strongly opposed to introducing and increasing costs for existing services, with the exception of parking –\nparking charges should be increased in all cases in order to encourage a reduction in car use, which is essential for\ncarbon reduction. Parking income should be used to give people who live outside Winchester an alternative to use\nthe car, better bus and cycle infrastructure.\nWe would urge you to Introduce local pollution and congestion taxes (e.g. ULEZ style charges for M3, road tolls etc)\nas a way of generating income but more importantly to reduce air pollution, curb the use of cars and reduce\ncongestion.\nParking charges and road-use tax of whatever form could move the subsidy from road freight and private cars (i.e.\nthe externalities usually reckoned at about three times the total tax and duty take from road users) to cross-\nsubsidise efficient public transport and move it from a vicious circle of decline to a virtual circle of growth.\n5. Reducing services\nWe strongly oppose any reduction in service. Replacing paid workers with volunteers is no way to run adult social\ncare services. Absolutely no further cuts to bus services or to library services which have both been devastated over\nthe past 10 years. School Crossing Patrols must not be cut – this will deter active travel and further endanger\nchildren.\n6. Increase Council Tax\nHaving the second lowest council tax in England in one of the most affluent areas does not seem right. If the\npopulation of Hampshire is relatively wealthier, it can afford to pay more council tax.\nWe support an increase over 4.99% with a referendum; and an encouragement to increase council tax charges to the\nwealthiest where possible.\nWhilst this will impact everyone, there are a number of discounts & exemptions in place for vulnerable residents.\nWe would also support the introduction of a 100% premium charge for second homes/holiday homes from April\n2025.\nNo mention is made in the consultation of increasing business rates – these too should be increased for medium and\nlarge businesses located in retail parks, out of town developments, supermarkets and other large complexes\naccessible only by car.\n7. Change structure to 1 tier\nRecognising the political difficulties of achieving this, we would recommend that efficiencies and sharing of\nresources through informal and collaborative relationships be explored without the structural change which seems a\nlong way off happening. It is important that decisions continue to be made at the closest practical level to those\naffected by them.\nOn behalf of Winchester Green Party\nKate Needham – Co-Chair\nMax Priesemann – Co-Chair",

He wants his children and grandchildren to grow up and enjoy a happy future and he believes that ‘The future is Green or not at all’.\nRichard grew up in a village and he understands the unique benefits and issues of village life. He is a keen environmental campaigner and would be a strong voice to speak up for local residents.\nMax Priesemann\nBadger Farm and\nOlivers Battery\nI enjoy living in Oliver’s Battery. It is a great place in Winchester close to the countryside.\nI care for our nature. We got given this planet to live and to protect it for future generations. Our wellbeing depends on it.\nYoung and old have suffered much from Covid pandemic, physically and mentally. As a doctor, I know that much more needs to be done for local people’s health.\nMy Oliver’s Battery junction was well supported but HCC have ignored it. We get effected by increasingly dangerous traffic. Streets are covered by a patchwork of potholes. We still only have 3 buses a week serving Olivers Battery. This needs to change.\nStop destroying nature with the wrong houses. We should build more council homes for those who can’t afford it, but only on real brownfield sites. Misuse of properties for investment purposes needs to be tackled.There is much to be done – Please vote for me!\nRichard Cannon\nBishop’s Waltham\nI moved to Bishop’s Waltham from Ashford in Kent five years ago.\nI am passionate about wildlife and nature and have seen the terrible demise in population of many creatures caused by poor agricultural policies, loss of habitat, woodland and climate change.\nBeing a keen walker and Wildlife Photographer has given me the pleasure of speaking to many people and to hear the many issues and concerns we have.\nRoad noise, pollution and safety are a priority issue along with ensuring local business’s are supported and our Countryside is maintained and improved where needed.\nOur Village, our County, our Country and Planet are in urgent need of environmental change and putting wrongs to rights. We must act now and the Green Party are the Party who will do just that, our many Councillors around the Country have been extremely successful in changing things for the good.\nDanny Lee\nCentral Meon Valley\nDanny has lived in Hampshire for more than 45 years and moved to Droxford in the Central Meon Valley two and\nhalf years ago. He welcomes challenging work and has the skills and experience needed to get things done. His expertise in leading large programmes and multi-national projects with diverse groups has successfully delivered challenging projects. This has been as a Royal Navy Officer, a sustainable design-and-build company Director, and with the Environment Agency.\nRecently he worked with the ‘Petersfield Action on Climate Change’ for the adoption of improved green building\nstandards which led to the creation of ‘Climate Change and Sustainable Construction’ supplementary guidance for the East Hampshire Local Plan.\nHe now works as a Citizens Advice advisor; a trustee for the ‘Winchester Action on the Climate Crisis’ and area co-ordinator for Energise South Downs – promoting community energy. These volunteering opportunities strengthen hisprevious experiences and ability to support the local community.\nDanny, if successful as a Winchester Green Party Councillor, looks forward to the opportunity to work for the\nresidents of Central Meon Valley and with Cllr Malcolm Wallace to strengthen an independent voice for the\ncommunity.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nLucinda Graham\nColden Common/Twyford\nLucinda was a teacher of art for many years. She now spends her free time working with clay, modelling figures for family members and friends. One such recent creation is a bust of Greta Thunberg, whom she admires for her astonishing bravery in speaking truth to power, a great source of hope to all like Lucinda who have long felt despair at the failure of governments to confront the looming Climate Crisis. Locally her concerns are for traffic-related air pollution, unsafe roads and the lack of safe provision for cyclists.\nLucinda is registered disabled and feels immensely grateful for the help she has had from the NHS, agencies such as the CAB and many friends. She sees this kind of fair and caring community as just an important part of the Green vision of the future as its commitment to the protection of Nature and the planet.\nBeata Parry\nDenmead\nI have been a resident of Swanmore since 2010. Before then I lived and raised my 5 children in the beautiful Blue Mountains, NSW Australia – an area declared as a World Heritage Site. Living in such a wonderful place inspired me to appreciate nature and wildlife and strive to protect it. I enjoy gardening – growing my own vegetables & fruit, using composting to help recycle waste and improve the soil, planting to provide friendly environments for wildlife. I am also a keen walker, observing the magic of seasonal changes & how it affects growth and habitats. Spending so much time outdoors made me realise how precious our planet is and how much it is changing. We all need to make more efforts to protect it. I feel strongly about reducing car pollution, eliminating chemicals from gardens & plastic in our homes. I am hoping to educate the next generations to reuse rather than buy new, recycle what we already have and reduce the amount of plastic, artificial fibres, etc. in everyday use. I believe the Green Party is the only party fully committed to make these changes.\nLorraine Abraham\nSt. Barnabas\nI have never stood as a candidate before, but I am inspired to do so now. As a grandmother I think about the future and the significant environment and climate challenges we all face, both local and\nglobal. The scale of these problems can seem daunting, but I seeGreen Councillors across the country working to improve the environment and the lives of people in their communities. Listening\nto people in Winchester, I hear concerns about our throw away culture and that they are keen to see local initiatives to reduce waste and encourage reuse. They want to see greater action to enable\nwalking, cycling and viable public transport and the use of more affordable renewable energy. By listening to local people andworking through our political system the Green Party can contribute\nto real change on these vital and urgent issues.\nCharlotte Harley\nSt. Bartholomew\nAs a member of the Green Party since 2019 and having grown up in Winchester, Charlotte is passionate about putting Green issues at the forefront of council policies.\nHer priority is to ensure that new buildings and developments are designed with the environment and local community front of mind. Charlotte is committed to ensuring that families and young people have access to safe green spaces and that these are protected and maintained.\nHer focus is implementing sustainable changes that will create a greener city and thriving community, with a commitment to the natural world and future generations\nReece Chadwick\nSt. Luke\n‘I have lived in Winchester almost half a decade now. The issues my neighbours have, I too share, and like them, I am also frustrated by how our council and councillors have neglected the people it serves.\nThe reason for why I have decided to run for councillor of St.Luke’s ward is because like my neighbours, I also want change and for the people we elect to be more community orientated and to do things for the benefit of every one of us.\nAll I care about is creating a happier, better, and safer community for each and every one of us’\nKate Needham\nSt.Michael\nWe are in a climate and biodiversity emergency. Local services have been cut and we have lost so much. I worry about what the future will be like for my grandchildren. I would like them to be able to paddle in the sea and local streams without fear of becoming sick. I’d like them to breathe cleaner air and be surrounded by more green spaces and nature. To be able to cycle more safely and to be able to afford to live here when they are older. We need to vote more greens into positions of power and influence in order to take action now for a greener, fairer world and a future we can all look forward to.\nGiles Gooding\nSt. Paul\nI have lived in Fulflood for more than 20 years and have been actively involved in the local community for most of this time.\nI volunteer with the Winchester Scouts and campaign on green issues with Friends of the Earth, WinACC and GreeningFulflood and also launched FreecycleWinchester in 2006.\nThe City of Winchester is choked by cars affecting the heath of its residents and visitors. Much has been promised to reduce traffic but little has been delivered.\nThe Council needs to increase its Green Voice to get the Movement Strategy back on track and prioritise pedestrians and bicycles over cars. I want to seea cleaner, healthier, fairer Winchester for all.\nNigel Prior\nSouthwick & Wickham\nI live in Wickham now and have been a part of this community for nearly two decades. I carry out several volunteer roles in the south Hampshire area and have done so for a decade or more.\nI care about our communities. Rural, village, town and city life in our area are all under threat as we continue to expand our presence, building more and more houses and roads on our vital green spaces. I am, I believe fairly well known across the Winchester district and until recent years have tried to stay ‘A’ political.\nHowever the damage we as human beings have done to this our one and only planet has drawn me towards environmental responsibility, equality, justice and solving the total disgrace that has become of our vital public services due to continued underfunding over the past 13 years.\nBuilding a safer environment for all is now my passion. Reducing our CO2 emissions and general impact on the planet is now critical to our survival as a human race.\nPolly Perry\nUpper Meon Valley\nI am trustworthy and reliable and love making a difference to people’s lives. I’m hardworking, a good communicator and ready to speak up for what’s right. My business is based in Bramdean, so I spend much time walking in the beautiful countryside around there.\nIt is really important to me that our countryside is protected from unnecessary overdevelopment and that our chalk streams (which are the envy of the world) are protected from issues with raw sewerage and pollution. As Council budgets are cut, I want to make sure that available funds are directed fairly towards providing and maintaining the services we need in often forgotten rural areas. We must think of the future!\nNicholas John\nWhiteley & Shedfield\nWhen we practice sustainability in our daily lives, it impacts positively on our own wellbeing as well as the workplace -meaning that personal wellbeing and environmental sustainability need not be mutually exclusive goals it should be shared.\nMy interest as a Green party member is to bring bold and innovative solutions to reduce waste and eco friendly solutions to the workplace and home. More than ever its about our wellbeing something politicians constantly over look, we need to reduce cars, plant more trees and join the Green Party the only party thatscares for our wellbeing.\nJulia Stolle\nWonston / Micheldever\nJulia Stolle has been living in Hampshire with her family for 2 decades. Like you, she loves her walks in the beautiful countryside but is concerned about the lack of public infrastructure, the increasing air pollution caused by the dependency on cars, increased risk of flooding due to overdevelopment and the underfunding of our schools, hospitals, and doctor surgeries.\nCurrent politicians still believe that more roads will be the answer when more roads only create more\ntraffic. A truly frequent and affordable public transport network is required so that people don’t have to travel by car anymore. Making cycling and walking safer will also help with mental health issues.\nJulia believes that insulating our homes, investing in green technology and subsidising solar panels on people’s homes will bring energy prices down and will create a fairer and more equal society.\nAndrew Pogson\nThe Worthys\nI have been interested in Green Polices and Politics since studying Meteorology at University.\nI moved to Kings Worthy three years ago and since then I’ve spent many hours exploring the wonderful surrounding countryside alongside my two Labradors.\nEven in this short time I have seen many changes that are concerning to me. The challenge of building for a sustainable future is particularly relevant here, where we must find ways to preserve our city’s heritage and natural environment.\nBy thinking more long term and planning with the bigger picture in mind. We can protect our local environment, boost our local economy and improve peoples quality of life. That is why I am proud to represent the Green Party this May.",

Suzanne White, Cllr. Malcolm Wallace raised a motion on the important issue of solar panels being installed on Council Housing.\nMalcolm stated “The Council must seize the opportunity provided by the development of more efficient, cost effective technologies as well as by the innovative solutions and business models offered by local companies that are tailored to the needs of councils’ housing….\nAs we have heard in the debate, these schemes are not without risks and challenges, in terms of upfront costs and ensuring equity of benefit across the tenant base for example. However, a feasibility study of the current market models will investigate what viable, practical options are available for Councils and is therefore worth exploring.\nIt is noted that the council’s retrofit programme will now include the possible options of solar PV and battery storage to be considered alongside the fabric improvements to the building to raise the energy performance ratings. Here is an opportunity to investigate how the council could scale up and crucially speed up this process of\ndecarbonisation of housing. By outsourcing to one of the local companies who are now running these schemes, there is very little extra staffing resource required. It could also have the added benefit of stimulating green business in our local economy.\nRead the Public Document pack HERE\nIn supporting this motion, we are showing leadership in making a very strong commitment to further reducing carbon and providing housing fit for the future. In the face of this uncertainty surrounding future local\ngovernment arrangements, we will send a clear message to council staff, residents and neighbouring authorities about our ambition to achieve the best possible housing for our tenants within any future combined unitary\nauthority.And so what about the tenants? From attending Housing committee meetings, it is notable how the council’s housing department put theneeds of our tenants at the heart of their decisions.\nThis motion gives usan opportunity to explore how solar panels could unlock further benefits for tenants- lower energy bills in the face of yet more price increases, more comfortable, healthy housing fit for the future, energy resilience in increasingly turbulent times.\nI am grateful to Cllr Wallace for his work over many months researching these schemes and to the officers and the housing portfolio holder who\ngave up their time to discuss and help shape the motion you are presented with. A truly collaborative effort which I hope you feel you can support.\nThank you.",

It was expected the new plan would originally be in place from August 2024. All developments, including large developments, will continue to be assessed against the current Local Plan.\n“The very high public response rate to last year’s consultation for the draft new Winchester Local Plan in combination with a raft of new Government legislation has led to this decision by the council.\n“This difficult position is beyond helpful in the face of the current climate, nature and economic crises with the urgent need for developments in the right places to better environmental standards.\n“A key question now is, can more rigorous environmental requirements be applied to developments before the delayed new Local Plan is approved by Central Government? After all, it is not impossible to find ourselves in a similar delaying situation in 2025 for reasons beyond the council’s control.”\nRest assured that both our Councillors, Danny and Malcolm Wallace, will be following this through, our City and surrounding area deserve to know what lies ahead.",

Climate Action for Newtown and Soberton (C.A.N.S), was born, with the main aim of reducing the carbon footprint of the parish.\nLooking at all the ideas suggested at the Climate Café, it was decided to form several subgroups to get started on some community projects. An Energy subgroup will be looking into the possibility of getting a thermal imaging camera to hire to locals to help them identify ways to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Some of the group will also attend some training to learn how to carry out feasibility studies for community energy projects in the village. A Waste Prevention group will start by helping local event organisers minimise and manage waste. Finally, a Biodiversity group will extend the work already started in the village of improving the diversity of wildflowers on the roadside verges.

The reforms prioritize centralized “super-councils” and regional mayoral offices, pulling power further away from local communities.\nLocal councils play a vital role in driving meaningful change on many issues such as energy-efficient housing, river pollution, social care reform, and local economic development. Empowering local councils, rather than sidelining them, is essential for effective local governance and close representation of communities.\nWhilst there are potential benefits from managing some areas, such as public transport, at a wider, strategic level, by shifting power away from councils, it risks deepening public disillusionment with politics and eroding trust in democratic processes.\nThe Green Party is calling for genuine decentralization, emphasizing that decisions should be made as close as possible to the communities they affect. The key requirements are:\n• Local decision-making: Ensure decisions are made at the closest possible level to the people affected.\n• Community trust: Empower local communities to shape their own futures.\n• Fair investment: Provide councils with adequate funding to drive meaningful change.\n• Proportional representation: Implement fair voting in local elections.\nGreen Party MP Ellie Chowns voiced her concerns during a parliamentary debate, stating, “I welcome the elements of this White Paper that are about devolution, but we have to recognize that some elements are about concentration.” She warned that replacing local tiers with mayoral authorities risks creating a “democratic deficit”, especially given the low voter turnout (30% on average) in mayoral elections.\nChowns pressed the government to address this risk and urged for the introduction of proportional voting systems in local elections. The Green Party’s overarching message is clear: devolution must genuinely empower local communities, not distance them from decision-making processes. They pledge to continue advocating for local councils to retain and expand their role in leading green transformation across the country.\nLocal Response from Central Meon Valley Councillors…\nCentral Meon Valley Councillors Danny Lee, Malcolm Wallace, and Suzanne White have committed to minimising the impact of the proposed changes on local decision-making and democratic accountability. They emphasized the need for local input on key priorities, including housing, environmental protection, local economy and infrastructure improvements.\n“As plans develop, we will work hard to ensure the impact on local decision-making and democratic accountability is minimised,” the councillors stated. “This includes ensuring local inputs into prioritisation of the right homes in the right places, supporting nature, climate, local economy, and transport improvements.”\nCllr Danny Lee added, “The timelines for the reorganisation of Winchester and the Meon Valley are still being worked on, but the Government has committed to collaborating with local councils to develop and implement transition plans. Specific timelines for the dissolution of existing councils and the establishment of new unitary authorities will be determined during this phase. So, for now it is business as usual”\nFor more information on the White Paper and the Local Government Association’s https://www.local.gov.uk/parliament/briefings-and-responses/devolution-white-paper-day-factual-briefing\nError: Contact form not found.",

They have selected Lorraine Estelle.\nLorraine said, “I am honoured to have been chosen as the Green Party’s candidate for Winchester. In recent years, more and more people have realised that far from being just about the environment, the Green Party stands for a way of doing politics differently and for pragmatic, proven policies that can transform our country – and that Green Party politicians can be trusted to have the integrity people expect.”\n“It’s clear for everyone to see that our country is in a total mess: politics as usual hasn’t worked – we need a new approach for real hope and real change. That’s why the Green Party has grown so rapidly. Since Malcolm Wallace was elected as our first Green Party Councillor in the Winchester District, we have doubled the number of councillors year on year, including the first councillor seat at Hampshire County Council only a few weeks ago.”\n“Addressing the cost-of-living crisis also means rapid action to tackle both the climate and nature emergencies. Tackling these crises together will make local residents and businesses better off. Our plan for a new UK law to address the full extent of the climate and nature crises, in line with the most up-to-date science, will be front and centre of our policies. Harmony is needed between the social, environmental and economic triple challenges to build a much fairer Britain. These three essentials must be taken forward together.",
