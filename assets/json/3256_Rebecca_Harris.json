But after Labour MPs voted against the amendment, the Government will have powers to do so at a whim.\nThe smoking ban forms just part of Labour’s war on pubs which is increasing business rates by £5,500 for the average pub and £5,528 for 20 pubs across Castle Point.\nThis tax rise comes on top of the National Insurance Jobs Tax which will increase the cost of employing staff by £7,200 for the average pub with eight employees.\nThe Conservatives have also forced the Government into guaranteeing that it will not threaten the imperial pint as part of its programme of EU alignment.\nPubs have warned that Labour’s war on pubs could push up the price of a pint by as much as 40p.\nDame Rebecca is urging people to sign a petition by the Conservatives to Save the Local and urge the Government to end Labour’s war on pubs. The petition can be found here: https://www.whatlaboursaid.com/save-our-local.\nCommenting, Dame Rebecca said:\n“Labour have launched a nanny state war on pubs that is driving up taxes and red tape on your local and they have now given themselves the power to ban smoking in pub gardens.\n“This is an attack on pubs and pub goers which is why the Conservatives have launched a petition to Save the Local from Labour’s war on pubs.\n“By signing the petition, you can help to Save the Local, support the local economy and keep the price of a pint down.”\nCommenting, Shadow Business and Trade Secretary Andrew Griffith said:\n“Labour’s plans for an effective pub ban on smokers serves no-one but their nanny state ideals whilst harming pubs at the heart of communities across Britain.\n“Pubs are a great British institution which you can help to support by signing our petition to Save the Local. Under new leadership the Conservatives will always back Britain’s pubs.”",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_access-cash/content_53.html": "UPDATE JUNE 2023\nThe Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 has now received Royal Assent. Supported by Rebecca at every stage this places free access to cash into law.\nThe vast majority of people and businesses are set to be no further than three miles away from withdrawing cash under a new framework by the Treasury, setting the minimum expectations on banks to protect services for people and businesses wanting to withdraw or deposit cash.\nAs part of this move, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been provided new powers by the government to protect the provision of cash access services. This includes protecting cash access without any fees for those who hold personal current accounts. The FCA will use these newfound powers to make sure banks and building societies are keeping up to these standards – and have the power to fine them if they do not.\nWhile the country is moving further away from using coins and notes with the number of online payments rising from 45% to 85% in the past ten years, cash can still be an integral part of many businesses and people’s lives.\nAs it stands, the vast majority of people living in urban areas can access cash deposit and withdrawal services within one mile; with rural-dwellers around three miles away. Today’s policy statement makes clear that the FCA should use its powers to maintain this level of coverage, while recognising that needs may differ by location and change over time.\nIt also makes clear that – if a service is withdrawn and a replacement service is needed – this should be put in place before the closure takes place.\nThe FCA is also required to ‘have regard’ to local deficiencies in cash access. The policy statement sets out that the regulator should consider factors such as the opening hours and distance to cash access services, as well as the need for in-person assistance.\nLaws introduced in the Financial Services Act 2021 have delivered cashback in over 2,500 shops across the UK – without any need to buy something in store – through the LINK network.\nUPDATE MAY 2022\nThe Government recognises the importance of cash to the daily lives of millions of people across the UK, particularly to those in vulnerable groups, and has announced that it will legislate to protect access to cash in the Financial Services and Markets Bill.\nThe new Financial Services and Markets Bill announced in the Queen’s Speech will support consumers by protecting access to cash. It will ensure the continued availability of withdrawal and deposit facilities across the UK, and that the country’s cash infrastructure is sustainable for the long term. The Bill builds on the Financial Services Act 2021, which was the first step in amending the UK’s regulatory regime outside of the EU.\nIn May, the Government published a summary of responses to the Access to Cash consultation. This set out the Government’s intention to establish the Financial Conduct Authority as the lead regulator for retail cash access and provide it with appropriate powers for ensuring that designated firms continue to ensure the provision of deposit and withdrawal facilities across the UK. The FCA’s powers will allow it to address cash access issues at both a national and local level.\nHM Treasury will publish its expectations in a policy statement, which the FCA will be required to have regard to in carrying out its functions. The Government intends to enable HM Treasury to specify baselines for reasonable access to cash withdrawal and deposit facilities across the UK, including in rural and urban areas, initially on the basis of current cash access provision.\nAround 96% of the population are within two kilometres of a free-to-use cash access point. This includes free-to-use ATMs, bank branches and Post Office branches.\n\"Access to cash remains vital to the day-to-day lives of individuals in our local communities across Castle Point.\nI welcome that the Financial Conduct Authority has been made ultimately responsible for ensuring the cash system works for consumers and businesses. Following this, in September 2020, the FCA published guidance setting out expectations that firms should consider the impact of branch and ATM closures on their customers’ everyday banking needs and consider the availability and provision of alternatives. I also strongly welcome that the Government legislated through the Financial Services Act 2021 to facilitate the widespread adoption of cashback without a purchase.\nI understand that Ministers remain closely engaged with financial regulators during this time to monitor and assess risks around cash acceptance and access resulting from COVID-19. I welcomed the news that legislation will be brought forward to protect access to cash.\nThe Treasury is committed to protecting access to cash for those who need it and I welcome that a Call for Evidence was published in October 2020 which sought views on the key considerations and regulatory oversight of the cash system. The Call for Evidence has now closed and on the basis of responses a consultation has now been launched as the next step in legislating to protect access to cash and ensuring the sustainability of the UK’s cash infrastructure. The Access to Cash consultation sets out proposals to further legislation, and I look forward to seeing the positive outcomes of the consultation.\" - Rebecca, March 2022\nATMs\n- Key findings of a report led by the University of Bristol in partnership with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), are: Free access to cash is readily available on almost all (99 per cent) of UK high streets within 500 metres. Just over three-quarters (77 per cent) of neighbourhoods have some form of free access to cash within 500m.\n- At present, LINK, the scheme responsible for ATM provision in our country, provides a top-up subsidy for free-to-use ATMs in remote areas. I was glad to hear that the upper limit on these top-up subsidies rose from 30 pence to £2.75.\n- LINK has promised to protect free ATMs more than one kilometre away from the next nearest free ATM or Post Office.\n- LINK has also committed to protecting free access to cash on high streets that do not have a free-to-use ATM or Post Office counter within one kilometre.\n- This is expected to benefit up to 3,500 free-to-use ATMs across the country. I also welcome that, as of September 2019, there were approximately 45,000 free-to-use cash machines across the UK, which represents a 13 per cent increase from a decade ago.\n- UK Finance launched its Community Access to Cash initiative to help local communities to identify and secure access to cash and payment services. This follows UK Finance’s engagement with consumer representatives, local authority representatives and market participants on the cash needs of local communities.\n- The Payment Systems Regulator has previously used its power to hold LINK to account over its commitment to communities, ensuring that there is a continued high level of access to cash.\nBank Branches\n- It is vital that all customers, wherever they live, can still access over-the-counter services. I am glad the Government is supporting the Post Office’s relationship with the banks. An agreement enables 99 per cent of banks’ personal customers, and 95 per cent of banks’ business customers, to withdraw cash, deposit cash and cheques, and make balance enquiries at a Post Office counter across a network of 11,600 branches.\n- I welcome that the Financial Conduct Authority has published draft guidance outlining their expectation of firms when they are deciding whether to reduce their number of physical branches or free to use ATMs. The FCA made it clear that firms should consider the impact of any planned closure on their customers’ banking and cash access needs and consider possible alternative access arrangements.\n- I am pleased that Post Office and UK Finance are working together to increase publicity of Post Office banking services and ensure more customers can benefit from them.\nFurther work is ongoing to prepare future legislation designed to protect access to cash, to ensure that the UK’s cash infrastructure is sustainable for the long term.",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_campaigns_roadworks/content_46.html": "Rebecca has continued her persistent campaign to reduce overrunning roadworks across the Borough and see the removal of lane restrictions and temporary traffic measures.\n2023/24 UPDATE:\nShe has focused in particular on the Balfour Beatty works at the A13 Saddlers Farm junction which choked the main entry way into our Borough for years. It was only when Rebecca requested a meeting with a Managing Director of Balfour Beatty that an apology was offered and a timeline for their removal was agreed. Rebecca, alongside her fellow motorists, was relieved to see the back of these permanent cones and barriers and finally see the end of these works. You can see more of her work on this here: www.rebeccaharris.org/news/rebecca-harris-mp-gets-commitment-sadlers-farm-works-balfour-beatty-parliament\nCadent and Essex & Suffolk Water are also responsible for some road closures we have seen across the Borough in recent months. Rebecca has been straight on the case and working with them and county councillors has seen roads re-open far sooner than originally planned. Rebecca welcomed Cadent's multimillion pound investment to upgrade the gas supply in the Borough so it is hydrogen-ready and will reduce the number of emergency works needed, which cause even more disruption. She continues to discuss with them how to do this whilst minimising the impact on residents.\nRebecca also welcomes the £17.4 million of additional funding that was committed to Essex Highways, including £5.4 million from the Government for pothole repairs in 2023/24. This money has meant 11 more highways crews have been hired across the county, leading to a 90% rise in the number of repairs taking place last year. Following the reallocation of HS2 funding, Essex will also receive an additional £121 million for pothole repairs over the next decade, on top of the money already agreed. This will make a huge difference in Castle Point, allowing for thousands more pothole repairs.\nRebecca has long campaigned for the Third Road off Canvey and hopes that Castle Point Council, who can bring forward a final proposal, will re-establish the Third Road Taskforce which she convinced them to set up in 2021.

The ‘Canvey Big Local Million’ worked with local mental health support charity, Trust Links, on a project to turn it into a real hub for the local community.\nThe plans for the Gunny include a community building, play areas, outdoor gym facilities, picnic benches raised vegetable beds and pergola.\nThe new trees already planted on site will be kept and a wetland area and wildflower meadow added. Trust Links will also be running therapeutic gardening sessions for local residents.\nThe project has received local grant funding and I was pleased to support a successful application for a grant of £300,000 in 2023 to get the additional funding needed to realise the vision.\nIt has taken a lot of hard work by many dedicated people to get this project off the ground and I can’t wait for the Gunny to be turned into a beautiful new space for the whole community.\nYou can find out more about the plans via this link: www.trustlinks.org/gunny-project",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_universal-credit/content_69.html": "Universal Credit - Supporting Low Income Families\nThe Government’s approach throughout the pandemic and the rise in energy bills following Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine has been to support all families –particularly those on low incomes – through a range of measures including the furlough scheme, the Energy Price Guarantee where the Government paid on average half of people's energy bills and over £100 billion in cost-of-living support. In 2024/2025 we will spend £138 billion on working age and children welfare, £89 billion on benefits to support disabled people and people with health conditions and £35.3 billion on housing benefits.\nThis Government is extending support for the lowest paid and most vulnerable. Universal Credit and other disability-related benefits rose by a further 6.7% in April 2024 and the Local Housing Allowance for housing benefits rates have risen to the 30th percentile of local rents for 2024/25 benefitting 1.6 million households by £785 on average. The Government also issued a series of Cost of Living Payments throughout 2022 and 2023 worth £13 billion to 8 million households on the lowest incomes to help with rising costs. The total support package was one of the largest in Europe, which has prevented 1.3 million people from falling into absolute poverty.\nAs part of the Government's record expansion of free childcare, parents on Universal Credit with one child under 17 are now able to claim up to £1,015 a month, with parents of two children or more eligible for up to £1,739 to help pay for childcare costs. The Holiday Activities and Food programme provides healthy meals, enriching activities and free childcare places to children from low-income families, benefiting their health, wellbeing and learning and since 2022 has provided 10.7 million days to children and young people in this country.\nAs well as this support, the £2.5bn Back to Work plan will help over a million long-term unemployed, sick and disabled people break down barriers to work, with the Chance to Work Guarantee freeing up claimants to try work with no fear of losing their benefits. The National Living Wage has also risen by 9.8% to £11.44 per hour, meeting the Government's manifesto commitment to raise this to two-thirds of median pay.\nUniversal Credit Reform\nUnder Labour the welfare system was broken, 1.4 million people spent years trapped on out-of-work benefits–with many receiving more than the average wage.50,000 households were allowed to claim benefits worth over £500 a week or over £26,000 a year–higher than the average wage at the time. Under Labour the welfare system punished work–people could lose over £9 of every £10 extra they earned. The benefit system was so complicated that for some people, there was virtually no financial incentive towork.\nUniversal Credit was the biggest and most fundamental reform to the welfare state since its creation. It is a modern benefit based on the sound principles that work should always pay and those who need support receive it. Universal Credit is paid on a monthly basis to align with the way in which the vast majority of employees are paid, and with how service providers and utility companies collect payments. A package of support including budgeting advice and Alternative Payment Arrangements exists for claimants.\nUniversal Credit Helpline\nAccording to the Universal Credit Service Claimant Survey, 98 per cent of claims are made online and over half did not need help from others. All Jobcentres across the UK have free Wi-Fi and there are computers available to support customers with making their claim online. I am glad that for people who are still unable to access or use digital services, or are not able to travel, assistance to make and maintain their claim is available via the Freephone Universal Credit helpline. If a vulnerable claimant requires, a home visit can be arranged to support someone in making and maintaining their claim.\nHelp to Claim\nHelp to Claim continues supporting our claimants. Help to Claim provides free, confidential and impartial support to help people make a UC claim. People using the service can get advice on anything to do with applying for the benefit, including gathering the required evidence, filling in the application or preparing for their first jobcentre appointment. People can also access support online, over the phone and face-to-face through local Citizens Advice bureaus",

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_news_castle-point-mp-pledges-support-breast-cancer-moonshot-project/content_47.html": "Dame Rebecca Harris, Member of Parliament for Castle Point, has signed her support to the Lobular Moon Shot Project to get Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer the research funding it needs.\nInvasive Lobular Breast Cancer is the second most common type of breast cancer and an estimated 3.75 million people will be diagnosed with this cancer in the next 10 years. Yet, it currently has no specific treatment and behaves very differently to the more common type of ductal breast cancer.\nAfter meeting Victoria Atkins, the Conservative Health Secretary, it was very clear why the Lobular Moon Shot Project needed to be funded. She agreed to fund the £20 million 5-year research project to address the unmet clinical need of lobular breast cancer and ultimately save the NHS millions. This was to be part of the Conservative Government’s 2024 Women’s Health Strategy.\nSince the election, however, the Project has received no indication from the current Labour Health Secretary Wes Streeting that this vital research is funded and he has not responded to any letter about this. Over 260 MPs from across the House of Commons are now calling on the Government to confirm this funding.\nCommenting, Rebecca said: “I am pledging my support to the Lobular Moonshot Project to improve research into lobular breast cancer. I am lobbying the Labour Government to confirm the funding planned by the Conservative Government, so that we can improve our knowledge and treatment of this disease and ultimately save lives.”\nManchester Breast Centre are ready to complete this vital research and to improve knowledge of the basic biology of lobular breast cancer so that specific and effective treatments can be developed for the disease. They just need the funding. £20 million is less than £240 per person who will be diagnosed with the disease in the next 10 years in the UK alone.\nSusan Michaelis and her team of volunteers have raised over £90,000 to enable the first vital research steps to be taken. They are now seeking the £20 million investment from the Government.\nSusan stated: “The first small steps that Manchester Breast Centre have taken in January are historic. MBC and their collaborative team can do this work to improve outcomes for millions of people.\nBefore the 2024 UK election, the then Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Victoria Atkins, confirmed she had agreed to fund the £20 million Lobular Moon Shot Research Project. The Project is now asking the new Secretary of State for Health, Wes Streeting, to allocate the funding needed so this unmet clinical need can be addressed.\nOver 260 MPs from every political party in the new parliament are calling on the Government to do so. This research project will help saves lives, improve outcomes and ultimately save the NHS millions.”",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_motorists/content_55.html": "October 2023 - Supporting Motorists - Plan For Drivers\nI recognise that the majority of people in the UK use their cars to get around and are dependent on that freedom. For this reason, the Government has announced a new plan to support people who drive, by keeping motoring costs under control, outlining 30 measures that will see smoother journeys, end unfair enforcement, crack down on inconsiderate driving and crucially make parking much easier and less frustrating for local residents. You can read the Plan online\nUltimately, I believe that the Government is committed to ensuring that decisions impacting motorists are both proportionate and made with the consent of local residents so that drivers are able to go about their everyday lives without unnecessary impositions.\nFuel Duty\nI have supported the Government’s actions since 2010 which has seen fuel duty frozen for 13 consecutive years saving drivers over £65 billion. At the Budget earlier this year, the Government announced continued support by maintaining the rates of fuel duty at the same levels for an additional 12 months, extending the temporary 5p fuel duty cut and cancelling the planned inflation increase for 2023-24. That represents a saving for drivers this year of overall around £5bn and for the average car driver around £100 and around £200 since the 5p cut was introduced. The Government will make further announcements on spending decisions at the Autumn Statement due to be held on 22nd November 2023.\n2035 Ban on Sale of New Petrol and Diesel Cars\nI am supportive of measures so that we will reach net zero together but they must be in a pragmatic, proportionate and realistic manner that will ease the burden on working people, rather than at the people’s expense and risk unnecessary high costs and burdens. That is why I support the decision to delay the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035. The alteration to 2035 brings us into line with most other countries and allows for more time to develop the extensive electric charging network, which is well underway with 44,000 charging points nationwide, for the battery technology to become even cheaper and the range improving so that households make the switch from petrol and diesel with convenience and reliability.\nSpeed Limits & Low Traffic Neighbourhoods\nThe Government has updated guidance on 20mph speed limits in England to prevent their blanket use in areas where it’s not appropriate, and amending guidance on low-traffic neighbourhoods to ensure local consent. As part of the review of low-traffic neighbourhoods, the Government will consider measures for existing anti-driver policies that did not secure local consent. The plans also aim to stop councils from using CCTV cameras to limit drivers unfairly, consulting on ways to prevent schemes which aggressively restrict where people can drive.\nULEZ (Update Sept 23)\nWhile I understand that air pollution does pose an environmental risk to human health, I do not agree that it should be done through expanding the ULEZ as the Mayor has now done. As specified in the ‘ULEZ Scheme Integrated Impact Assessment’, the Mayor’s own independent impact report, the expansion of the ULEZ is estimated to have a negligible beneficial impact on improving air quality in outer London areas.\nIt will have a detrimental impact on local businesses and the people of Castle Point, who aren’t able to vote in the London mayoral election but are directly affected by his decision. Despite the hundreds of millions of pounds proposed to be raised annually, the Mayor has announced a limited scrappage scheme to help Londoners prepare for expansion. This is purely a money-grabbing exercise hiding behind the guise of air pollution, it is unacceptable and does not have my support.",

This will allow the NHS to continue to focus on reducing waiting times and bring the NHS’s resource budget in 2024/25 to £164.9 billion. This means that NHS funding will increase from 2023/24 and equates to a real-terms increase of 13% since 2019/20. Our NHS is set to be in receipt of £1 billion more per week than in 2016.\nAn additional £3.4 billion of capital funding was also announced at the 2024 Budget to aid the NHS’ technological and digital transformation between 2025/26 and 2027/28. This will slash the 13 million hours lost due to outdated It systems, will use AI to cut in half the form filling currently done by doctors, will digitise operating theatre processes allowing 200,000 more operations per year, will help read scans more accurately speeding up 130,0000 results and ensure all hospitals use electronic records.\nREDUCING WAITING LISTS\nThe Government and NHS has published a series of recovery plans. These cover;\n- Operations and Elective Care - www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/delivering-plan-for-tackling-the-covid-19-backlog-of-elective-care/\n- Urgent and Emergency Care - www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/B2034-delivery-plan-for-recovering-urgent-and-emergency-care-services.pdf\n- GPs and Specialists in Primary Care - www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/delivery-plan-for-recovering-access-to-primary-care-2/\nThe NHS is performing a record number of appointments, tests and procedures well above pandemic levels. The Government’s Health and Care Act 2022 has created new Integrated Care Systems which convene all local NHS services, social care providers and the local authority to commission new services to ensure the needs of the area are met far quicker. This will reduce pressure in A&E across the country as more people receive the preventative healthcare they need, keeping them out of hospitals altogether.\nThe Government is improving A&E and ambulance performance, with targets for 76% of patients being admitted, transferred or discharged within 4 hours by March 2024 and improved ambulance response times for Category 2 incidents to 30 minutes on average over 2023-24. Further improvements against both measures back towards pre-pandemic levels are planned for 2024-25.\nNationwide, £1 billion has also been invested to provide an additional 5,000 hospital beds, 800 ambulances on the road and over 10,000 are now being treated through new virtual wards so that people can be monitored from their own home. The £1.6 billion Better Care Fund in discharge funding will make sure that patients are able to leave hospitals as soon as they are able to reduce bed blocking and reduce waiting times.\nLOCAL ACTION\n108 Community Diagnostic Centres have also been created across the country which have delivered 3.8 million tests and procedures and our closest will be based in Southend and Pitsea. In our area, we have also seen a further £8 million invested into A&E services alongside a surgical day unit at Southend Hospital and a further £110 million investment at Basildon, Broomfield and Southend Hospitals. Once opened, the day unit will offer a further 5,600 procedures a year, helping reduce patient waiting lists.\nThe Canvey X-Ray has also finally re-opening, I know many residents have been eagerly waiting for this news and I urged the NHS teams to get this up and running as quickly as possible and I was pleased to be shown the completed work. Along with the other new additional services being offered at the Canvey Primary Centre it will make a huge difference to people right across the Borough accessing these vital services, reducing waiting times, allowing more tests to take place and most importantly all happening closer to home.\nNHS LONG TERM WORKFORCE PLAN\nThe NHS Long Term Workforce Plan was announced last year and is the first of its kind – a plan asked for and created by the NHS itself and backed by £2.4 billion of government investment to ‘Train, Retain, Reform’.\nIt sets out really ambitious proposals including a doubling of medical school places, increasing GP training by 50% and dentists by 40% and an aim for 130,000 fewer staff leaving the profession over the next 15 years by making the NHS a more attractive career to pursue. Most recently, the Government abolished the lifetime allowance on pensions to make sure those who want to work within the health service are not penalised for doing so.\nThe Government has now delivered its manifesto commitment of an additional 50,000 nurses working in the service who are performing a record number of procedures. The plan also includes proposals to recruit 60,000 more doctors, 170,000 more nurses and 71,000 more healthcare professionals by 2036/37. There is also an additional £7.5 billion allocated to social care for 2023-25 to ensure they have the resources needed to care for a growing number of people.\nNHS PAY UPLIFTS\nI know that we all value the work that the NHS carries out and so I am pleased the Government last year accepted in full the recommendations of the independent pay bodies. This meant that most doctors and dentists received a 6% pay rise last year. Over 1 million staff, including nurses and paramedics, received a pay rise of 5% and two one-off payments worth on average over £2,000. Junior doctors also received a 10.3% uplift, with the offer of further discussions about improving working conditions, to end the strikes we have seen. The discussions for the 2024/25 pay settlement are now underway.\nPHARMACY FIRST PROGRAMME\nPatients can now get treatment for seven common conditions directly from their local pharmacy, without the need for a GP appointment or prescription. The Pharmacy First scheme was launched by the Government and NHS England at the start of 2024 to give patients quick and accessible care and ease pressure on GP services. This will enable community pharmacists to supply prescription-only medicines, including antibiotics and antivirals, to treat seven common health conditions without the need to visit a GP – Sinusitis, Sore throat, Earache, Infected insect bite, Impetigo, Shingles and uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections in women.\nDENTAL RECOVERY PLAN\nThe Government’s new plan aims to make sure everyone who needs to see a dentist, particularly those who have been unable to access care in the past two years, will be able to do so.\nDentists will be offered a ‘bonus’ to take on more NHS patients which will create more than 2.5 million new appointments in the next year. They will also be offering ‘golden hello’ cash incentives for dentists to come and work in areas that are under-served. This will allow around 1 million new patients access to NHS dental treatment, who may previously have been unable to access the dental care they need. From later this year, up to 240 dentists will be offered £20,000 to stay and deliver NHS care for at least three years in areas where recruitment and retention of dentists is difficult. This plan is supported with £200 million to ensure everyone has fast and fair access to a dentist when they need one.\nSMOKE-FREE GENERATION\nSmoking is the single biggest entirely preventable cause of ill-health, disability and death. It leads to 80,000 deaths a year in the UK, and is responsible for 1 in 4 cancer deaths, and over 70% of lung cancer cases. Smokers lose an average of ten years of life expectancy. Firstly, the Government will create the first smoke-free generation so children turning 15 this year or younger will never be legally sold tobacco through the Tobacco and Vapes Bill. The age of sale will be raised by one year each year to prevent future generations from ever taking up smoking, as there is no safe age to smoke.\nTo reduce the appeal of vapes to children, the Government also announced new powers will be introduced to restrict vape flavours and packaging. The powers will also allow government to change how vapes are displayed in shops. They will also bring in quicker and simpler £100 fixed penalty fines for shops which sell vapes illegally to children. Trading standards officers will be empowered to act ‘on the spot’ to tackle underage tobacco and vape sales. This builds on a maximum £2,500 fine that local authorities can already impose. Vaping alternatives - such as nicotine pouches - will also be outlawed for children who are increasingly turning to these highly addictive substitutes.\nMENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT\nThe Government is investing £2.3 billion of additional funding a year to expand and transform mental NHS health services, so an extra 2 million people can get mental health support. More than £400 million to improve mental health facilities, including by giving patients the privacy of their own bedroom. An additional £150 million will be used to build new facilities to support mental health urgent and emergency care services, including £7 million for specialised mental health ambulances and funding for new crisis cafes, crisis houses, mental health urgent care centres and health-based places of safety. Funding for mental health is expected to increase to 8.9% of NHS funding.\nThis will also help an additional 345,000 children and young people to access NHS-funded mental health support. Spending on mental health services for children and young people has also increased, with spend of around £1.1 billion planned in this financial year. There is a Mental Health Support Team attached to almost all of our schools in Castle Point and this means they are receiving help from a dedicated NHS team to deliver this service.\nThe draft Mental Health Bill is intended to modernise the Mental Health Act so that it is fit for the 21st century and works better for people with serious mental illness. The draft Bill has completed its pre-legislative scrutiny and Ministers are considering the Committee’s recommendations carefully and will introduce the Bill when parliamentary time allows.",

I will continue to support vulnerable pensioners through the winter months as best as I can and urge everybody who is above state pension age to check if they are eligible for Pension Credit.”\nDame Rebecca Harris MP spoke in the debate in the House of Commons arguing against the changes to the Winter Fuel Payment, highlighting the significant impact this will have on vulnerable pensioners in Castle Point who rely on this money to help heat their homes. You can find her full speech by pressing here.\nIn total, 347 Labour MPs, including the Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, voted to cut the payments despite real warnings that pensioners would be forced to choose between heating and eating this winter.\nAfter the vote, which only came about after strong pressure from Conservative Party, Dame Rebecca Harris said she would continue to fight to help protect vulnerable older people in Castle Point during the winter and will continue to lobby the Government to change their plans.\nAs the Winter Fuel Payment is set to be means-tested and delivered to those on Pension Credit, Rebecca wants to make sure every single pensioner in Castle Point who is eligible is receiving this. Many people assume it is automatic and that you don’t have to apply for it so they never check, only to discover they can receive thousands of pounds in support when they do. The DWP estimates that £1.7 billion of Pension Credit went unclaimed in 2021/22.\nPension Credit, which can mean over £3,900 support a year, is there for those above State Pension age and on a low income to lend a hand with your everyday expenses - boosting your weekly earnings and giving you access to extra benefits.

Or by visiting: www.gov.uk/pension-credit/how-to-claim Please share this information with anybody you know over the state pension age as they may be eligible.\nDame Rebecca is deeply concerned that the Chancellor has publicly stated that taxes will rise in the Autumn Budget and the impact this will have on residents across Castle Point and will continue to push for lower taxes and continue to press the Government to protect pensioners.",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_winter-fuel-payment/content_65.html": "\"I completely disagree with the Labour Government’s decision, which will affect thousands of pensioners across Castle Point. I believe the decisions taken by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have been entirely wrong and unfair. The choice to means-test eligibility for the Winter Fuel Allowance will mean losses of up to £300 for around 10 million pensioners.\nThe Conservative Party is completely against this plan. My colleagues and I are actively lobbying the Chancellor to rethink her decision. If Labour’s proposals are put in front of Parliament, I will vote against them. There was no requirement for the Labour Government to do this.\"\nDame Rebecca Harris MP, August 2024\nLabour Ministers have claimed to have inherited the worst set of circumstances since the Second World War in their attempt to justify this raid on pensioner’s incomes by taking away the Winter Fuel Payment from 10 million pensioners. Yet when the Conservatives took over from Labour in 2010, the economy was in a much worse state.\nIn 2010 unemployment was at 8% - the Conservatives nearly halved it to 4.4%; the deficit was 10.3% of GDP - it is now 4.4% and is forecast to fall to 1.2%; Inflation was at 3.4% and today it is back at 2%. After 14 years of a Conservative Government Labour inherited the fastest-growing economy in the G7, low inflation, low unemployment and 12 months of consecutive wage growth.\nDespite claiming a black hole in the public finances, the new Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already spent £8.3 billion of taxpayers’ money on a public energy company, £7.3 billion on a national wealth fund and around £10 billion on inflation busting public sector pay deals, without asking for any improvements in productivity in return. I believe it is entirely wrong to make pensioners pay for these decisions.\nIt was the Conservative Government who introduced the Triple Lock in 2011, which I voted for. The State Pension was uprated by 8.5% in April, meaning pensioners received up to a £900 cash boost. This follows a 10% increase in 2022/23. Since April, the basic State Pension has risen by £3,736 since 2010, ensuring pensioners’ have the income they need to live in dignity.\nThe Labour Government laid The Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations 2024 to enact these changes to the Winter Fuel Payments on 22nd August. Under Parliamentary procedure the Government does not have to provide time for this to be debated, despite the heavy criticism. A survey this week found that 59% of people are against this cut.\nThe Conservative Party have taken the steps to submit this Early Day Motion to ensure that this matter is debated before Parliament, allowing Members of Parliament to put forward the views of many of their constituents. These regulations also reveals that the Labour Government have taken this decision despite there not being a full impact assessment produced as “no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.” The motion has been signed by Rishi Sunak MP, Jeremy Hunt MP, Mel Stride MP and Claire Coutinho MP.\nRebecca stood on a manifesto at the recent general election that was committed to the Triple Lock Plus, which would have introduced a new age-related personal allowance that meant pensioners never paid tax on their state pension. On current plans, Labour will drag the state pension into income tax for the first time in history and should this happen, Rebecca will oppose this.\nFinally, as the Winter Fuel Payment is set to be means-tested and delivered to those on Pension Credit, Rebecca wants to make sure every single pensioner in Castle Point who is eligible is receiving this. Rebecca has long campaigned for the uptake of Pension Credit, as many people assume it is automatic and that you don’t have to apply for it so they never check, only to discover they can receive thousands of pounds in support when they do. The DWP estimates that £1.7 billion of Pension Credit went unclaimed in 2021/22.\nPension Credit, which can mean over £3,900 support a year, is there for those above State Pension age and on a low income to lend a hand with your everyday expenses - boosting your weekly earnings and giving you access to extra benefits.

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_ulez-expansion/content_50.html": "The London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)\nThe ULEZ was introduced by the Mayor of London to help improve air quality in the city, as the most polluting vehicles pay a levy in order to use the roads. Of those vehicles that are subject to the levy, most pay a standard rate of £12.50, while heavier vehicles such as lorries, buses and coaches, pay £100. Transport within London is devolved to the Mayor of London. There is no legal requirement for the Mayor to consult either central or local Government on the decision to expand the ULEZ. The Mayor expanded ULEZ across all London boroughs from 29th August 2023. The expanded zone covers the same area as the Low Emission Zone. Further information on vehicles that meet the ULEZ standards, how to pay the charge, and discounts or exemptions, can be found on the TfL website at the following link: https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone\nAlthough I appreciate the objections on the matter, unfortunately, the decision to extend the ULEZ is solely for the Mayor of London. I completely agree with many of the points made about the impact of the expansion of the ULEZ on those who commute into London and small businesses. However, there is no legal requirement for the Mayor to consult either central or local Government on the decision to expand the ULEZ.\nWhile I agree that air pollution is a big environmental risk to human health and we are determined to tackle it, the Government does not agree that it should be done through expanding the ULEZ as the mayor is suggesting. As specified in the ‘ULEZ Scheme Integrated Impact Assessment’, the mayor’s own independent impact report, the proposed expansion of the ULEZ is estimated to have a minor to negligible beneficial impact on improving air quality in outer London areas.\nIt will have a detrimental impact on local businesses and the people of Castle Point, who aren’t able to vote in the London mayoral election but are directly affected by his decision. Despite the hundreds of millions of pounds proposed to be raised annually, the mayor has announced a limited scrappage scheme to help Londoners prepare for expansion. The scheme will only be open to certain residents and Londoners, not those from outside London who are affected and travel daily, including many local residents. These hard-working people will not be touched by that scheme at all and many small and medium-sized businesses and hardworking people in Castle Point will be left to bear that heavy burden alone. This is purely a money-grabbing exercise hiding behind the guise of air pollution, it is unacceptable and does not have my support\nAlthough I and many of my colleagues in Parliament have voiced our objections to Mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans, the Government sadly does not have the power to veto his decision.Rebecca Harris MP (January 2023)\nEssex Councillor Lee Scott, cabinet member for highways maintenance and sustainable transport at Essex County Council, said:\n“Essex County Council will not allow any other areas to use the County Council’s land for cameras or other equipment related to the proposed expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone.”\nSign the petition: https://action.conservatives.com/stop-drivers-tax/",

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_hs2/content_67.html": "October 2023:\nThe Government has announced that we will deliver HS2 between Birmingham and Euston in central London as planned – but we will take every pound that would have been spent extending HS2 beyond this and instead invest the full £36 billion in transport improvements that will benefit far more people, in far more places, far more quickly – we are building NETWORK NORTH.\nFor too long, we have been getting transport infrastructure wrong. Our great towns, cities and rural areas are not achieving their true potential. Our new vision for transport will focus on the forms of transport that matter most to people, that best drive growth and jobs, and truly levels up our country. HS2 has become a significant part of the problem: costs have more than doubled, it has been repeatedly delayed, the pandemic has completely changed travel patterns, the economic case is far weaker and it continues to crowd out transport spending that would benefit the rest of the country. In short, the facts have changed and we need to change our approach if we are to change the country.\nThis change is transformative with every region of our country will have more transport investment from Network North as a result of this decision – every penny committed to the Northern leg will go to the North, every penny committed to the Midlands leg to the Midlands, and every penny saved from our new arrangement for Euston station will be spread across every other region in the country.\nFollowing the reallocation of HS2 funding, Essex will now also receive an additional £121 million for pothole repairs over the next decade, on top of the money already agreed. This will make a huge difference in Castle Point, allowing for thousands more pothole repairs.\nFebruary 2020:\nI welcome that at a time when the construction sector faced uncertainty during the coronavirus outbreak, the Government’s subsequent decision to authorise ‘Notice to Proceed’ for Phase One of HS2 has provided certainty for construction companies, communities along the route, and the wider UK supply chain supporting this transformational project.\nI am also particularly pleased about the Government’s determination to see a line drawn under the failures of HS2 Ltd.’s management, transparency and cost control to date. A dedicated Minister with specific responsibility for oversight and accountability of HS2 has been appointed and they will present regular reports to Parliament to enhance transparency.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) has formally ordered the redesign of the HS2 terminus at Euston station, following recommendations made in the Oakervee Review in 2020. The review recommended that the station should be scaled back to provide a solution based around 10 HS2 platforms, a single stage build and increased oversite development, as the planned two-stage build would prolong the construction of the HS2 station, incurring further cost. I understand that all three recommendations made in the review have been worked into the redesign of the station. HS2 Ltd.’s role will also change. The complex Euston station element will become the responsibility of a new body.\nHS2 & Environment\nHS2 will play an important role in the UK’s transition to a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. I understand that HS2 will offer some of the lowest carbon emissions per passenger km, seven times less than passenger cars and 17 times less than domestic air travel in 2030. Indeed, HS2 is expected to help reduce the number of cars and lorries on the road and cut demand for domestic flights. It is estimated that the total carbon emissions produced by both constructing and operating Phase One for 120 years would be the same as just one month of the UK's road network.\nI am also pleased that a green corridor will be created alongside the railway. This will involve the planting of seven million new trees and shrubs, including over 40 native species, along the Phase One route from London to the West Midlands. An overall £70 million funding package has also been made available to enhance community facilities, improve access to the countryside, and help improve road and cycle safety in towns and villages along the HS2 Phase One route.\nThere are approximately 52,000 ancient woodland sites across England, and of these, 43 will be affected by Phases One and 2a of HS2. It is worth noting that more than 80 per cent of the total area of these 43 sites will be untouched by HS2 and remain intact. I want to reassure you that HS2 is using a combination of approaches to compensate for the ancient woodlands lost during construction. This includes translocation of soil to other woodlands to improve their biodiversity, planting new woodland and restoring existing ancient woodland.\nThe HS2 Woodland Fund – overseen by the Forestry Commission – funds projects to support the creation, restoration and enhancement of woodland on private land or in partnership with multiple landowners. I understand that the Government has committed £7 million to establishing this Fund, and that the first £1.6 million for Phase One has already been allocated to supporting approximately 115 hectares of new native woodland creation, and the restoration of around 160 hectares of of plantations within ancient woodland sites.\nHS2 Ltd and its contractors are obliged to comply with all relevant legislation on nesting birds. Indeed, all birds, as well as their nests and eggs, are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and all HS2 vegetation clearance is accompanied by measures to prevent any breach of the law. When habitat clearances need to be undertaken during bird nesting season, these clearances are carried out in accordance with guidance from trained ecologists, in line with Natural England guidance.\nA Working Method Statement is completed before clearance work starts and appropriate ecological supervision is also provided. Work can also only commence when an ecologist has finished a pre-commencement site survey and given a Permit to Clear. All work needs to be monitored by the on-site ecologist, and the ecologist can halt works if necessary. Buffer Zones are implemented if breeding birds are present during works, to allow work to continue in the surrounding area.\nUseful link: Read the ‘HS2: Our Story & Key Facts’ booklet, which contains information on HS2 journey times and routes:",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_campaigns_domestic-abuse/content_40.html": "Due to the actions of this Conservative Government we now have truly world-leading legislation on the statute book to tackle domestic abuse and violence against women and girls. Rebecca has supported all the measures that have been brought forward.\nDOMESTIC ABUSE ACT 2021\nIn 2021, Rebecca was the Whip in charge of making sure the Domestic Abuse Act was passed into law and during this she heard directly from survivors, charities and women’s groups about the horrors they faced or continue to see. Rebecca considers it one of her proudest achievements to have guided it through Parliament.\nThe Act:\n- Creates a statutory definition of domestic abuse, emphasising that domestic abuse is not just physical violence, but also emotional, controlling or coercive, and economic abuse.\n- Establishes in law the office of Domestic Abuse Commissioner and set out the Commissioner’s functions and powers. The office is currently held by Nicole Jacobs.\n- Places a duty on local authorities in England to provide accommodation-based support to victims of domestic abuse and their children in refuges and other safe accommodation.\n- Creates a statutory presumption that victims of domestic abuse are eligible for special measures in the criminal, civil and family courts.\n- Extends the offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress (known as the “revenge porn” offence) to cover threats to disclose such material.\n- Creates a new offence of non-fatal strangulation or suffocation of another person.\n- Enables domestic abuse offenders to be subject to polygraph testing as a condition of their licence following their release from custody.\n- Places the guidance supporting the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (“Clare’s law”) on a statutory footing.\n- Provides that all eligible homeless victims of domestic abuse automatically have ‘priority need’ for homelessness assistance.\nDOMESTIC ABUSE PROTECTION ORDERS & NOTICES\nThe Act introduces a new civil Domestic Abuse Protection Notice to provide immediate protection following a domestic abuse incident, and a new civil Domestic Abuse Protection Order to provide flexible, longer-term protection for victims.\nProtection Notices will provide immediate protection following an incident and the Orders will focus on longer term protections including compulsory attendance for perpetrator behaviour change programmes, electronic monitoring and mandatory disclosures of perpetrator name and address changes. These will be piloted in areas across the country from June 2024.\nTACKLING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS\nIn December 2020, the Home Secretary opened a Call for Evidence to hear directly from the public on tackling violence against women and girls. Following the national outpouring of grief as a result of the tragic case of Sarah Everard, it was re-opened and received more than 180,000 responses. This was unprecedented and made for essential but grim reading. As a result, more than £500 million has been invested into the Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy in July 2021 and the complementary Tackling Domestic Abuse Plan in March 2022.\nIDVAs & ISVAs\nThis Government is providing strong protections for victims. By 2025 funding for victim support services will have quadrupled compared to 2010, with the expansion of Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs) and Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs). This additional funding will mean the number of IDVAs and IDSAs posts increases by 300, to over 1,000, by 2024/25.\nThese individuals have a significant role in providing high-risk victims of domestic abuse with a tailored and person-centred safety and support plan so that victims and their families are protected from abusive behaviour. This includes risk assessment, safety planning, advocacy, emotional support and empowerment. We know that when victims are supported by them, they are nearly 50% more likely to stay engaged in the system, which helps enable justice to be delivered.\nThe Victims and Prisoners Bill introduces new statutory guidance for these roles that will include a deliberately broad definition of ISVAs and IDVAs and will place a duty on them to have regard to the statutory guidance.\nVICTIMS AND PRISONERS BILL\nThe Victims and Prisoners Bill is also progressing through Parliament which Rebecca is supporting, delivering another manifesto commitment.\n- Placing the overarching principles of the Victims’ Code into primary legislation, to send a clear signal about what victims of crime can and should expect from the criminal justice system.\n- Placing a duty on relevant bodies to promote awareness of the Victims’ Code so that victims are aware of and understand their entitlements both before victims choose to report a crime, and throughout the victim’s journey in the criminal justice system.\nThis legislation will reform the parole system to better protect the public and ensure those behind bars with a whole life order are barred from marriage. Many are wrongly not offered the opportunity of making a Victim Personal Statement and many feel ill-informed by the police and justice system. Therefore, the Bill will place a duty on both to collect data on their compliance with the code, of which this is part, and introduce regulations to standardise this so local areas are clear what they should be doing, where they aren’t and outline how to improve it.\nIt will also allow victims to have the right to a face-to-face meeting with the prosecution team in the face of a ‘not guilty’ plea by the perpetrator to ensure they are fully aware of the process ahead of them and allow victims to feel far more at ease and ask any questions or voice concerns they may have. This will include outlining the possibility of providing video evidence. The Government has changed the law so that rape victims can pre-record their evidence which is available nationwide and that domestic violence victims are spared from being cross-examined by their perpetrator.\nLEGAL AID REFORMS\nThe Government is ensuring legal aid is available to all that need it. The income and capital thresholds are being raised meaning 3.5 million more people will be eligible for support in the magistrate courts and 2.5 million more through the civil court system. Specific changes also mean that barristers are able to be paid to provide their clients with the option of pre-recorded evidence, with the numbers using this method expected to treble because of this change. Of course, this will mean the courts need to be capable of facilitating this which is why the £1.3 billion court modernisation programme has been progressing to allow for the greater use of modern technology in our courtrooms.\nSAFETY OF WOMEN AT NIGHT FUND & SAFER STREETS FUND\nSince the Safer Streets Fund launched in 2020, the Government has invested £185 million through five rounds of the Safer Streets Fund and the Safety of Women at Night Fund across England and Wales. The funding will go towards the rollout of additional CCTV, street lighting, alleygating and improving the security of properties at risk of neighbourhood crime for burglary hotspot areas and remote locations and on the night-time economy and working with local businesses to keep women safe and raise awareness of violence against women and girls in local pubs and bars.\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL\nThe Criminal Justice Bill includes provisions which will mean offenders with a conviction of controlling or coercive behaviour sentenced to longer than 12 months will be automatically eligible for collaborative management by the police, probation and prison services, who will have a legal duty to manage the threat of the individuals involved.\nSENTENCING BILL\nThe new Sentencing Bill which will create a new duty to impose Whole Life Orders, a sentence meaning an individual will never be eligible for parole, on the most heinous crimes and add murder involving sexual or sadistic conflict to this list to ensure that life means life.\nPRIVATE MEMBERS’ LEGISLATION\nMost recently, as the Private Members Bill Whip, Rebecca has been pleased to assist the passage of the Child Support Collection (Domestic Abuse) Act 2023 which will mean extra protections are now put in place meaning the CMS will be able to intervene in cases where abuse is evident using its power to collect and make payments, avoiding any need to contact the perpetrator involved.\nShe also supported the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Act. The Act creates tougher sentencing for offenders that harass, alarm or cause distress due to the perceived sex of the victim-survivor so that it carries a maximum prison sentence of 2-years for the offence of public harassment.\nFURTHER PLANNED MEASURES\n- Adding those convicted of coercive or controlling behaviour to the Violence and Sex Offender Register.\n- Adding violence against women and girls to the Strategic Policing Requirement, placing violence against women and girls on the same footing as serious organised crime and child sexual abuse.\n- Expanding the hugely successful ‘Ask for ANI’ scheme\n- Expanding the Disclosure Scheme for information on a partner and any previous offences they may have so that this is available within 28 days than the current 35.",

One of their responsibilities is making sure the maximum number of their party members vote, and vote the way their party wants.\nOther whip duties\nWhips frequently act as tellers (counting votes in divisions). They also manage the pairing system whereby Members of opposing parties both agree not to vote when other business (such as a select committee visit) prevents them from being present at Westminster.\nWhips are also largely responsible (together with the Leader of the House in the Commons) for arranging the business of Parliament. In this role they are frequently referred to as 'the usual channels'.\nThe Whip\nEvery week, whips send out a circular (called 'The Whip') to their MPs or Lords detailing upcoming parliamentary business. Special attention is paid to divisions (where members vote on debates), which are ranked in order of importance by the number of times they are underlined.\nThree-line whips\nImportant divisions are underlined three times - a 'three-line whip' - and normally apply to major events like the second readings of significant Bills.\nDefying a three-line whip is very serious, and has occasionally resulted in the whip being withdrawn from an MP or Lord. This means that the Member is effectively expelled from their party (but keeps their seat) and must sit as an independent until the whip is restored.\nSmall majorities and whips\nThe job of the whips becomes more important if the majority of the party in government is small.

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_news_dame-rebecca-harris-mp-speaks-against-daws-heath-green-belt-development/content_3.html": "Yesterday, I spoke for local residents at a planning appeal to build 173 houses on Green Belt in Daws Heath. We should not have to give up our farmland to meet an arbitrary housing target set by the Government, especially when they are requiring inner city and more urban areas to build less homes.\nThis is an opportunistic land grab by developers who know that Councillors have committed to saving Green Belt sites like this in their draft local plan, which I understand they are still planning to release in a matter of weeks. I was pleased to stand with residents and local councillors in opposition to this opportunistic attempt at land grabbing by developers and I sincerely hope the planning inspector dismisses this appeal.\nYou can find a full copy of my speech below:\n\"Firstly may I say thank you for allowing me to speak on behalf of my residents and indeed for kindly agreeing to allow me to speak so early in today’s proceedings so I can get back to my duties representing residents in Parliament as soon as possible.\nThis is the third time in a year I have spoken in this chamber on behalf of my residents to defend the Green Belt in Daws Heath. Sir, they quite rightly feel that the Green Belt central to the semi-rural character of Daws Heath is under siege.\nSir, you will no doubt be aware that common sense and sound argument prevailed on both of those previous occasions. Your colleagues agreed that development on the Green Belt is inappropriate and I sincerely hope you will be able to come to the same judgement and preserve the Green Belt in Daws Heath for future generations to appreciate.\nThe arguments I wish to make against this appeal and in many instances the specifics of the Appellant’s case, fall around six key areas:\n1) Status of the land as Green Belt\n2) The Green Belt functions the site fulfils\n3) The traffic generated by the development\n4) Specific concerns about flooding and drainage\n5) Concerns about wildlife\n6) The status of the withdrawn local plan and the emerging new local plan the Borough Council are currently working on\nBefore I begin my substantive points though Sir, I wish if I may to make a few comments about the opening remarks by the appellant’s (the developer’s) barrister.\nFirstly, he referred to the circa 700 annual housing target imposed by the Deputy Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. Angela Rayner MP as housing ‘need’. Sir, that is not a housing ‘need’, that is a target set by a politician in Westminster based on political objectives. The objectively assessed need outlined by the Council is the true need figure. Although the Deputy Prime Minister may direct you, or the Borough Council, to adhere to her own annual housing figure, it should not be referred to as ‘need’. It is an arbitrary local target set by a politician far from here.\nCounsel for the appellant also stated that over 50% of the Borough is Green Belt. Although that is true on paper, a lot of the Green Belt is inaccessible to anyone but lapwings because it is marshland. The percentage of the Borough that is Green Belt that could potentially be built on is significantly lower.\nMoving on to my main points.\nFirstly, I am deeply concerned by the outrageous assertion made by the appellant in points 2.1 to 2.4 and in several other places throughout their Statement of Case, that because Policy GB1 from the 1998 adopted local plan was not saved by the former Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Hazel Blears in 2007, the relevant Green Belt designation and protections contained within the adopted 1998 Castle Point Local Plan do not apply.\nSir, this is the second time I have seen an appellant push this assertion during a planning appeal to justify building on local Green Belt in the space of a year. The first time, was during the appeal that took place between 4th-7th June last year for an application to build 455 homes on pristine Green Belt on ‘Land east of Rayleigh Road, Thundersley’, little more than a stone’s throw away from the site of this appeal. It is a case that the Borough Council have included in their evidence for consideration so I will not quote the application number. In a judgement delivered on the 22nd August last year, that appeal was dismissed and the appellant’s highly flawed assertion that Green Belt designation in Castle Point has not existed since 2007 was not mentioned once in the judgement, indicating this assertion was completely dismissed. I urge you Sir to find in accordance with that precedent. For your benefit, I will briefly run through the arguments I submitted against this assertion at that appeal. I apologise to those who have already heard them as clearly the appellants haven’t.\nIn September 2015, I made a lengthy submission on behalf of residents in a four-day planning appeal, an appeal for a proposed circa 265 home development on Green Belt South of Jotmans Lane in Benfleet. After a lengthy legal battle we were successful. The appeal reference was APP/M1520/A/14/2216062 and in the decision notice from the Secretary of State for that appeal, a decision notice incidentally legally tested at the Court of Appeal, Sections 10-11 state:\n“In reaching his decision, the Secretary of State has had regard to section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 which requires that proposals be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. In this case the development plan consists of the saved policies of the Castle Point Borough Council Local Plan (LP), adopted on 17 November 1998. Policy GB1, which dealt with control of development in the Green Belt, was not saved. The Secretary of State has taken into account the Court of Appeal’s decision that notwithstanding the failure to save LP Policy GB1, the Green Belt designation, shown on the Proposals Map, persists.”\nThis in itself references section 5.1 and 5.2 from the Inspector’s report accompanying the decision notice for said appeal which states:\n“The statutory development plan for the area includes the saved policies of the Castle Point Borough Council Local Plan, adopted on 17 November 1998. The appeal site lies within the boundaries of the Green Belt, as defined on the Proposals Map. The Saving Direction, dated 20 September 2007, did not include Policy GB1 which dealt with the control of development in the Green Belt. The Court of Appeal decided that notwithstanding the failure to save LP Policy GB1, the Green Belt designation, shown on the Proposals Map, persists. In the absence of any Local plan policy controlling development in general in the Green Belt, the Council makes no reference to the development plan in its reasons for refusal, nor does it rely on it in evidence. Instead, the Council has been largely guided by the approach set out in the National Planning Policy Framework, and the subsequent Planning Practice Guidance.” End Quote\nIncidentally, the Court of Appeal decision referred to in that judgement was a successful decision against a planning appeal for land at Glebelands in Thundersley which the Council, myself and hundreds of local residents fought against a few years before then.\nSir, the reason why that decision is particularly relevant is that again, here for this appeal right now, the Borough Council Development Control Committee also makes no reference to the 1998 development plan in its reasons for refusal, nor does it rely on it in evidence. The great emphasis that the appellant has placed on the fact that GB1 from the 1998 plan was not saved is a complete red herring at best or a deliberate attempt to undermine all Green Belt sites across the Borough at worst and I contend irrelevant to the main arguments surrounding this case.\nIn their statement of case, when it comes to the planning balance the appellant seems to be putting all their eggs in one basket, the basket being this argument that the application is in accordance with the 1998 adopted local plan, openly stating that the presumption in favour of sustainable development or tilted balance test need not apply. Sir, you can quite clearly see on the proposals map contained in the 1998 plan that the Court of Appeal agreed was relevant, that this site we are discussing today is consequently, unequivocally in Castle Point’s designated Green Belt and therefore should be protected as such.\nJust as I was when I made these arguments in June of last year, I remain deeply worried that a ruling that accepts the appellant’s assertion that Green Belt designation hasn’t existed in Castle Point since 2007 in any meaningful way, sets a dangerous precedent completely at odds with the sentiment behind the Secretary of State’s decision on the Jotmans appeal in 2017. It would have serious consequences for any future appeals and potentially weaken the protection that land designated as Green Belt in the 1998 adopted plan enjoys, which incidentally is ALL of the land that local residents and the Council currently identify as Green Belt.\nSir, reading the Statement of Common Ground for this appeal it would seem that the Borough Council are willing to concede this point to the appellant, however Sir I am not and I don’t believe any resident who in Castle Point would want that point conceded either today.\n2)\nSir, the application site clearly fulfils many of the functions of Green Belt:\n- It checks the unrestricted urban sprawl of Daws Heath\n- It safeguards the countryside from encroachment\n- It prevents neighbouring settlements from merging into one another, in this case Hadleigh and Daws Heath\n- Its existence assists with urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of brownfield land in the existing urban periphery of Castle Point\nThe very existence of the site as undeveloped Green Belt means it meets the first two purposes by default, as indeed does any site in the Green Belt.\nThe Council in their Statement of Case make a strong argument for the importance of the site in preventing the merger of Daws Heath and Hadleigh. A birds eye view, available through Google, shows that if the site is developed there will be an unbroken string of houses along the bow of Daws Heath Road between house numbers 469 and I believe 479. There is a gap in the housing of about 30 yards on the east side of the road, but this is negated by the fact there is a property on the other side of the road making the ribbon of housing between this site and Hadleigh unbroken.\nSir if this application is granted, as there would be that continuous ribbon of housing along the road, it would undermine the purpose of the Green Belt immediately to the south of this site and to the south of Solby Farm on the other side of Daws Heath Road, as the settlements of Daws Heath and Hadleigh will have already effectively merged in planning terms. It therefore weakens the permanence of the new Green Belt boundary that would be established by this development and makes the Green Belt land to its south and south west far more vulnerable to development in the future.\nWhile I cannot support the Borough Council’s concession about Green Belt policy in the 1998 plan as it relates to this application, I fully support the Council’s arguments about the openness of the Green Belt made in their Statement of Case on the site and the loss of visual amenity. Castle Point as a Borough has a semi-rural feel that is crucial to its character. This is because between every major settlement in the Borough and indeed between them and settlements in neighbouring Boroughs, there is at least one field or a patch of woodland between them. I would say this is particularly the case for Daws Heath where I know local residents truly treasure the village feel of their community. Undermining the openness of the Green Belt with this application risks irretrievably damaging the character of Daws Heath in that respect and that should be taken into account.\nI am slightly baffled that in their Statement of Common Ground, the Castle Point Borough Council and the appellants seem to have agreed that this site does not fulfil the function of promoting the recycling of local brownfield land, when I and I am sure many local residents would very much contend that it does.\nThe large number of new flatted developments and the intensification of sites already in the urban area is a testament to the success of the local Green Belt. Developers will always prefer virgin greenfield land compared to brownfield land simply because there are no overheads from demolition. Effectively banning development on the Green Belt forces developers to recycle underutilised brownfield land and that is exactly what we have seen here in Castle Point.\nSir, there is no doubt that this site fulfils many functions of Green Belt and if this appeal is won, it would cause very substantial harm to not just this site, but potentially other local Green Belt sites as well, and I believe it should be soundly rejected.\n3)\nMoving onto transport, I share the many sensible concerns of local residents about the increase in traffic that Daws Heath Road itself would face as a result of this development. Looking at the mix of housing, from experience, I believe we are looking at an extra 300 cars on our local roads if not more, as well as the associated delivery vehicles etc.\nSir, the vast majority of vehicle movements along Daws Heath Road have to also pass through one of three junctions, The Woodman’s Arms junction on Rayleigh Road in the North West, the Junction with London Road by St James the Less Church in Hadleigh Town Centre in the South, or the T junction with no slip roads at the end of St Michael’s Road onto the national speed limit A127 dual carriageway in the North East. All of these junctions are already very congested at peak times and the vehicle movements generated by the development will only make the situation worse.\nSir I am pleased to hear you are planning to include a site visit in your itinerary for this enquiry. I urge you to pay a visit at rush hour to the Woodmans Arms junction and the junction of Daws Heath Road and London Road. It would not be safe for anyone to stand at the junction of the A127 and St Michael’s Road however. That I feel is the only way you will get a true representation of just how overloaded those junctions are already at peak times.\nAs I have stated in previous planning appeals for development on Green Belt in Daws Heath, the A129 Rayleigh Road around the Woodmans Arms and Rayleigh Weir junctions is one of the most congested roads in Castle Point. Both junctions are already severely overcapacity at peak times and frequently close to gridlock throughout most of the day. Rayleigh Weir is the southern boundary of the Rayleigh Air Quality Management Area and several concerns have been raised about the nitrogen dioxide levels in the locality. Adding further congestion to Rayleigh Weir and the A129 is only going to exacerbate the problem and I cannot see any specific mitigation measures included in the appellant’s planning application.\nThe T junction at the end of St Michael’s Road is a junction based on an ancient right of way that would not meet modern safety standards for new junctions if it were to be installed today. I am very concerned about even more pressure being put on that junction through developments such as this.\nThe junction of Daws Heath Road and London Road is a junction that sees a lot of pedestrian footfall and is often congested as it is where two lanes merge to one on the London Road, which as the A13, is one of the two main routes East-West for the whole of South Essex. This junction also suffers from congestion, and extra vehicle movements from this development if it is approved, would only make it worse.\nNow, I fully acknowledge that the developer may well allocate money via a ‘Section 106 Agreement’ for road and junction improvements, but no possible junction improvements will deal with the central problem of the increase in traffic volume that will be added to our already over-congested road junctions that local residents are forced to use every day.\n4)\nAs well as concerns about the extra traffic the new homes will generate, I also have concerns regarding the drainage of the site and the possible effects of extra built environment on the nearby Prittle Brook.\nSir, on the 20th July 2014 dozens of my residents across Castle Point were flooded in the middle of the night, a significant number of them in Hadleigh, when the Prittle Brook and its tributary to the South of this site overflowed and flooded people’s houses. My office was receiving calls from terrified residents asking for help as the emergency services lines were engaged and they were watching helplessly as water flooded into their homes from their back gardens and up through surface water drains.\nI appreciate that if this appeal were to be granted, the appellant would have to incorporate a ‘Sustainable Urban Drainage System’ into the development. Sir I know from harsh experience how nearby development, even with sustainable urban drainage systems in place, can lead to flooding around the Prittle Brook. Residents less than half a mile away who have a tributary of the Brook running at the end of their gardens have experienced flooding where they had not had it before since the building out of the nearby Ashcroft Place development for example.\nSir, the main point I wish to make here however, is that Anglian Water made the following comment on the original application;\n“Desktop analysis show that the proposed development will lead to an unacceptable risk of flooding downstream. A feasible drainage strategy must be achieved. The preferred method of water disposal would be sustainable urban drainage.\"\nSir this is I believe the first time I have ever seen a water company take the trouble to raise such a concern at application level, which tells me a lot about the serious level of concern they must have about the application. It is certainly Sir, the first time I have ever seen an application with such a stark comment regarding comment regarding flood risk, reach the appeal stage.\nSir I have looked at the sustainable urban drainage scheme listed in the evidence for this appeal and to my absolute horror the scheme itself drains into Prittle Brook! Sir the utility company responsible for surface water drainage has said this development will lead to an unacceptable risk of flooding downstream and the proposed sustainable urban drainage system does nothing to mitigate it and I believe that is reason enough to throw out this appeal alone.\nBefore I move on from flooding and drainage I wish to add that the Hadleigh and Benfleet areas contain a series of unmapped underground streams that feed into either Prittle Brook or the Thames. I have lost count of the times when I have been contacted directly by residents, or discovered through knocking on their doors, that they have issues with water coming up in their road or in their back gardens that neither Essex County Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority or Essex and Suffolk Water and Anglian Water as the local water companies can explain. Sir I believe the proximity of the Prittle Brook means that development on this site may well disturb an unmapped underground waterway and I do not believe the appellant has explored this possibility enough in their evidence.\n5)\nSir I have fought hard during my time in Parliament to improve animal welfare and so wildlife preservation in planning is something I take a particular interest in. The residents of Castle Point have done a very eloquent job of raising their concerns about the negative effect on local wildlife this development may have in their public comments on the original planning application and I don’t wish to repeat an argument that has already been so well made.\nWhat I will add however is that I believe utmost consideration should be given to the objection submitted to the original application by the Essex Badger Patrol. They stated that this proposal will:\n“encroach on badger habitat resulting in displacement and inconvenience for local residents as badgers seek new foraging areas”.Local residents come to me with problems about badgers causing a nuisance in this area enough already thank you without displacing them and causing more!\nSir, that is a legitimate objection to this development that I do not believe has been properly addressed in the appellant’s evidence and I ask you to take it into the utmost consideration here today.\n6)\nFinally Sir, the last substantive points I want to make on behalf of residents relate to the status of the draft local plan withdrawn in 2023 and the emerging local plan that the Borough Council are due to take to Regulation 19 consultation in a few weeks.\nSir, the last draft local plan was withdrawn by Castle Point Borough Council precisely to prevent the development of this site and other large single plots of Green Belt around the Borough. In withdrawing the last draft plan, I know several Councillors and large numbers of the concerned public were of the understanding that it would no longer carry weight in planning decisions. I therefore am very disappointed and not a little surprised on behalf of residents that the developers refer constantly to the withdrawn plan throughout their case.\nThe appellant and the Council both agree that the policies in the withdrawn local plan have no weight. I can see why the appellant wishes to argue that the evidence used to justify the last plan has weight because reading it you could be forgiven for thinking that it was evidence compiled that is specifically designed to support development on sites like this in the Green Belt. Sir if that evidence is to be attributed weight in these proceedings, that should not outweigh the democratically expressed wish of local councillors to disregard the policies that ‘evidence’ was used to support.\nSir, looking at the timing of the appeal it is clear to me that the appellant is looking to exploit the fact that while the Council do not have a published draft local plan in place that can be afforded legal weight in planning appeals, they are vulnerable to piecemeal speculative development on the Green Belt. Sir, I understand that draft plan is due to be published by the Borough Council in a matter of weeks. If the Council choose to protect Green Belt sites like this in that plan, which I and I am sure an overwhelming majority of local residents are hoping they will, then I believe that decision contained in the draft plan will be given significant weight. On behalf of residents, I believe it is a shame then that this appeal is happening now and not then.\nSir, point 3.16 in the appellant’s statement of case states that currently “There is no short-or-medium term strategy to address this persistent and ongoing chronic lack of local market and affordable housing within the borough.” That is true for now, but I am confident it will not be true in a few weeks time when the Council have released their draft plan.\nSir, I urge you to consider that a draft plan from the Borough Council is mere weeks away and I urge you to not prejudice this long awaited plan before it is even released by agreeing this development on Green Belt.\nAnd finally Sir, I urge you to let my residents have their voice heard through their elected Councillors as to the future shape of the Borough they live in through the development of a local plan and not allow opportunistic developers to deprive them of that voice through speculative planning applications such as this.\nThank you for giving me the time to speak on behalf of the residents I represent in Daws Heath and indeed around the whole of Castle Point. Sir, I sincerely hope you will reject this appeal and preserve this important local Green Belt site and with it the semi-rural character of Daws Heath and indeed the Borough as a whole. Castle Point’s new local plan is weeks away from being released, that is the vehicle to see the homes we need delivered in our Borough, not planning appeals on speculative planning applications on our Green Belt such as this. Thank you very much.\"",

I will continue to fight these measures every step of the way.”\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has confirmed the consequences of Labour’s reckless choices. Under Rachel Reeves, the economic outlook has sharply deteriorated, leaving working people in Castle Point to pay the price.\n- Growth cut in half. Forecast GDP growth for 2025 has collapsed to just 1%, with the OBR citing structural weakness in the economy – much of it driven by poor productivity and falling business confidence.\n- Inflation rising again. Inflation is now expected to rise to 3.2% this year - more than double the forecast level when the Conservatives left office in 2024 and above the Bank of England's target.\n- No growth in living standards. Real GDP per person remains below pre-pandemic levels, with households facing stagnant wages, rising prices and higher taxes.\nJust months after her first budget, the Chancellor has been forced to return to Parliament. This Emergency Budget is not a plan – it is an admission of failure and a direct result of the economic chaos created in Downing Street.\nCommenting, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Mel Stride said:\n“Labour inherited the fastest-growing economy in the G7 — and in just months, they’ve brought it to a standstill. Growth halved, inflation rising, taxes at record highs and unemployment on the up.\nThe British people are working harder, paying more, and getting less.

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_campaigns_sodium-valproate-compensation/content_13.html": "Rebecca has been campaigning for the women and their families who have been affected after taking sodium valproate during pregnancy.\nSodium Valproate was first licensed in the UK to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder in 1972, despite the fact it was known to be harmful to a developing foetus in animals. Several women and children raised their concerned that exposure to sodium valproate during pregnancy had caused serious harms and that there had been no or an inadequate warning of the associated risks. It has now been definitively linked to autism and learning disabilities in children when taken during pregnancy.\nRebecca has been campaigning alongside the women and their families affected by this so that they receive the financial compensation they rightly deserve. Rebecca was formerly a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Valproate before her role as a Government Whip and has met with members and representatives from INFACT, the national valproate campaign on several occasions.\nCUMBERLEGE REPORT:\nIn 2018, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Jeremy Hunt MP subsequently announced a review led by Baroness Julia Cumberlege. The Cumberlege Review or the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review laid bare the consequences of a healthcare system that does not listen to the experiences of women and made for sober reading.\nFollowing this, the Conservative Government accepted the vast majority of her recommendations and oversaw the introduction of a new statutory duty of candour requiring NHS trusts to inform patients when their safety has been compromised, new legal protections for whistleblowers and the launch of the new NHS Patient Safety Strategy.\nHEALTH AND CARE ACT 2022:\nThrough the Health and Care Act 2022, which Rebecca supported, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body has been established, a new independent body which will look at claims of serious safety issues. We also now have the first-ever Women’s Health Strategy for England to address the historical imbalance for women’s healthcare and this will have a huge impact on outcomes and patient safety.\nMHRA RECOMMENDATIONS:\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has introduced a new recommendation that sodium valproate is not offered to new female patients under the age of 55 if they have never taken it before and if it is, then it should only be prescribed after 2 specialists have independently looked at the patient’s case and determined that no other medicine is available for them. For those women who are already taking it, 2 specialists will need to independently consider and document that no other medicine is effective or tolerated and that the patient should continue to receive it.\nThe NHS and MHRA has also established the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, ensuring that women are fully aware of the risks of taking sodium valproate during pregnancy. They have also now introduced the Medicines and Pregnancy Registry which monitors the effectiveness of this programme by holding data on all women and girls of childbearing age who are taking this and making sure they are accessing the necessary support through the services available.\nCOMPENSATION:\nConservative Ministers worked with NHS Resolution to launch a new specific Claim Gateway for sodium valproate and mesh implants, allowing people to bring forward medical negligence claims, including sources of independent legal advice. You can check if you are personally eligible for this here: https://resolution.nhs.uk/sodium-valproate/\nAs part of the Cumberlege Review recommendations, the Conservative Government appointed Dr Henrietta Hughes OBE as the first Patient Safety Commissioner for England to focus on holding the NHS and Government to account, to champion patients and improve safety of medicines and medical devices. She was asked by Conservative Ministers upon taking this role to undertake a review of those affected after taking sodium valproate to understand the scale of its impact and provide options for redress.\nThe Commissioner has now delivered her report and Rebecca had spoken to the previous Health Minister about this. The Conservative Government had written to the Patient Safety Commissioner in May 2024 to provide an initial response to the report, highlighting the need for primary legislation to make redress payments, and that more work was required to consider the financial redress options proposed.\nWe now have a new Labour Government and so Rebecca has written to the new Patient Safety Minister, Baroness Merron and asked her what plans Health Ministers and the Department of Health and Social Care have more widely to bring forward this legislation. Rebecca will continue to raise this until the Labour Government have responded in full to the Commissioner’s report, so that the women and families affected by sodium valproate gain the compensation they rightly deserve.",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_business-innovation-and-skills-select-committee/content_22.html": "Rebecca was a member of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee from July 2010 to March 2015. The Committee was appointed by the House of Commons to examine the administration, expenditure and policy of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and its associated public bodies.\nThe remit of the Committee reflected the responsibilities of the Department of Business, Innovation, and Skills and included issues such as the Government's relationship with Royal Mail, competition policy, higher and further education, business competitiveness, and trade promotion.\nAs part of her role, Rebecca participated in a number of high profile campaigns such as:\nPubs\nOne Government policy to come under the scrutiny of the BIS Committee was that of pub reforms. Of particular concern to Rebecca and the other members of the committee was the issue of tied pubs. Following advice from the Committee, the Government made a number of substantive reforms to its original proposal. These changes ultimately led to a change in the law which would now allow landlords to buy their beer on the open market and not from breweries at inflated prices. The new legislation also allows landlords independent rent reviews instead of being tied to rates set by breweries.\nRebecca understands the importance of pubs as central hubs of the community. She recognises the difficulties faced by small business owners and has been active in her support for reform of the pub industry in favour of hard working publicans.\nRoyal Mail\nOne of the most high profile areas to come under the scrutiny of Rebecca and her colleagues on the BIS committee in recent times has been the issue of the Privatisation of Royal Mail. Rebecca voted strongly in favour of this policy. The committee praised the Government for meeting its objectives in terms of delivering a privatised Royal Mail service, although it did question whether taxpayers received value for money in relation to the initial share price. The full report of the Privatisation of Royal Mail can be found on the parliamentary website here http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmbis/539/53….\nPay Lenders\nThe Business, Innovation and Skills Committee held an evidence gathering session on the regulation of payday loan companies following the Committee's report in 2012 on Debt Management. During this session, Rebecca grilled several representatives of payday lending outfits, the regulatory and consumer advice bodies, as well as members of the Financial Conduct Authority on the role and scope of payday lending in the UK.\nThis is an issue that Rebecca has long championed. Giving loans with a representative APR of over 5800% is not responsible. Encouraging people to defer on their payments is not responsible. Targeting vulnerable groups like students and the unemployed is not responsible. These practices need to stop and Rebecca believes that her work as part of the BIS Select Committee has gone a long way to reigning in the excesses of some of these unscrupulous firms.\nRebecca has continued her campaign and welcomed the recent regulations that came into force in April 2014, that will see Payday lenders monitored by the Financial Conduct Authority, including new rules that will force lenders to carry out affordability checks on customers.",

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_gaza/content_61.html": "The people of Gaza are facing a humanitarian disaster and I understand that many people have been moved by the plight of innocent Palestinian civilians. Of course, I would like to see the end of the war through a humanitarian pause and a sustainable permanent ceasefire and I fully support the delivery of aid into Gaza to support the civilians there.\nThe UK is working via all diplomatic channels, bilaterally and collectively in the region to ensure that this conflict can be brought to a halt to reach a sustainable permanent ceasefire. The Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary have frequently visited the region since the start of the conflict to speak to all leaders so that we can see the necessary progress for a sustainable ceasefire. The only way this will happen is that Hamas must agree to release all of the hostages they still hold, they must no longer be in charge of Gaza and they should end all threats of further attacks. Instead, the Palestinian Authority must provide the necessary governance in the region backed by substantial international aid. All sides must then reaffirm their commitment to a two-state solution. This is the only way a sustainable outcome will be reached.\nThe UK Government has also repeatedly stressed that Israel must take every precaution to minimise civilian casualties, in line with international humanitarian law, to ensure that the campaign is targeted against Hamas terrorists and military infrastructure. We must see discipline, professionalism and restraint from the Israeli military. I agree that ordinary civilians must be safe and able to access food, water and medical care. Ministers have been clear that the UK would not support a major operation in Rafah unless there is a very clear plan for how to protect people and save lives. We have not seen that plan so, in these circumstances, we would not support a major operation in Rafah.\nMay 2024 - Humanitarian situation in Gaza\nThe UK has more than trebled aid to £70 million for the Occupied Palestinian Territories partners including the British Red Cross, UNICEF, the UN World Food Programme and the Egyptian Red Crescent Society. This is in addition to the existing £27 million of assistance the Government had already committed. £4.25 million of this aid has been set aside to help ensure life-saving support to vulnerable women and girls through the United Nations Population Fund. This support is expected to reach around a fifth of adult women in Gaza, with up to 100 community midwives, around 20,000 menstrual hygiene kits and 45,000 clean delivery kits.\nFour humanitarian flights, enabled by the RAF, have delivered a total of 74 tonnes of aid to Egypt. These deliveries have included lifesaving items such as wound care packs, tents, blankets, mattresses and vital equipment including forklift trucks, belt conveyors and lighting towers. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary Ship Lyme Bay also delivered 87 tonnes of UK and Cypriot aid from Cyprus to Egypt earlier this year. The UK and Qatar working together delivered a shipment containing 17 tonnes of family-sized tents. The UK and Jordan delivered 4 tonnes of aid by air to Tal Al-Hawa Hospital in northern Gaza, including medicines, fuel and food for hospital patients and staff. The UK RAF has airdropped over 10 tonnes of food along the northern Gaza coastline. This included water, rice, cooking oil, flour, tinned goods and baby formula for civilians. 150 tonnes of UK aid, including more than 13,000 blankets and 840 family-sized tents entered Gaza in March through the Jordanian land route.\nThe World Food Programme is distributing more than 2,000 tonnes of UK-funded food aid. This includes fortified wheat flour for bakeries, hot meals and ready-to-eat food parcels. The food parcels will feed more than 275,000 people in Gaza. Most recently, UK aid has been successfully delivered to the Gaza shore, in the first delivery across the US-built temporary pier. The first of 8,400 shelter coverage kits have arrived, with more aid including 2,000 additional coverage kits, 900 tents, 5 forklift trucks and 9,200 hygiene kits, will follow in the coming weeks. This clearly demonstrates the huge efforts the Government is making so we continue to provide the humanitarian support the people of Gaza desperately need.\nI want to reassure you the Foreign Secretary has met with leaders in the region, including the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, on several occasions to push for aid deliveries to rise to 500 trucks per day to match the high levels of need. Israel should now do everything possible to clear the backlog of aid waiting in Egypt and open key crossings, including the Port of Ashdod and the Karem Shalom for far longer periods.\nApril 2024 - World Central Kitchen aid workers\nI was appalled and deeply saddened by the news of the airstrike that killed World Central Kitchen aid workers, including 3 British nationals, in Gaza. These were people who were working to deliver life-saving aid to those who desperately need it. My thoughts and sincere condolences are with their families and friends at this incredibly distressing time.\nOn 2 April, the UK Minister for Development and Africa summoned the Israeli Ambassador to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, where he set out the UK Government’s unequivocal condemnation of this incident. On the same day, the Prime Minister spoke to his Israeli counterpart and demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation into what happened.\nI know that the UK Government is carefully reviewing the initial findings of Israel’s investigations into the killing of the World Central Kitchen aid workers and welcomes the suspension of two officers as a first step. Their inquiry so far has highlighted failures in deconfliction processes and the unacceptable conduct of the IDF personnel involved. This must never happen again. These findings must be published in full and followed up with a wholly independent review to ensure the utmost transparency and accountability.\nThe Foreign Secretary has underlined the need for Israel to ensure effective deconfliction in Gaza and ensure effective systems to guarantee the safety of humanitarian operations. The UK continues to raise this with Israel at the highest levels.\nFebruary 2024 - Ceasefire votes in Parliament\nThis war is being fought between the terrorist group Hamas and the democratic state of Israel, while of course, I would like the fighting to end the UK Parliament does not have any legislative power to force a ceasefire. Signing Early Day Motions or voting for an amendment for a ceasefire will not bring about a It is completely false to claim otherwise. Even if every single MP in Parliament voted for a ceasefire - the war would not stop, that is a fact.\nAs you may know, on the 21st February, an Opposition Day Debate secured by the SNP chose to debate this important issue. Unfortunately, the Speaker broke convention by selecting the Labour Party amendment which effectively meant that the SNP motion would have been amended by Labour and this motion written by the Labour Party could have been the main one voted on. While all three main parties support some kind of ceasefire in Gaza, the Speaker did not give the chance for a vote on the Conservative Government's motion either. If I was given the chance I would have supported the Government's amendment which stated:\nThis House...“supports Israel’s right to self-defence, in compliance with international humanitarian law, against the terror attacks perpetrated by Hamas; condemns the slaughter, abuse and gender-based violence perpetrated on 7 October 2023; further condemns the use of civilian areas by Hamas and others for terrorist operations; urges negotiations to agree an immediate humanitarian pause as the best way to stop the fighting and to get aid in and hostages out; supports moves towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire; acknowledges that achieving this will require all hostages to be released, the formation of a new Palestinian Government, Hamas to be unable to launch further attacks and to be no longer in charge in Gaza, and a credible pathway to a two-state solution which delivers peace, security and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians; expresses concern at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and at the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah; reaffirms the urgent need to significantly scale up the flow of aid into Gaza, where too many innocent civilians have died; and calls on all parties to take immediate steps to stop the fighting and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.”",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/https_www_rebeccaharris_org_campaigns_canvey-islands-third-road/content_56.html": "I have campaigned for a Third Road off Canvey throughout my entire time as the MP for Castle Point and it remains one of my top priorities. With new jobs at the DP World Port and the development of the old Coryton site, plus the economic disadvantage of regular gridlock on Canvey, I believe the economic case for a Third Road is compelling. I have consistently called for a Third Road and over the years had many meetings to try to get the project off the ground.\nI lobbied the then Leader of Castle Point Council to set up the Third Road Taskforce and bring Essex County Council as the highways authority for Canvey and Thurrock as the highways authority for Coryton around the table. He agreed, and in April 2022 a Castle Point Borough Council led taskforce was set up and the Councils had agreed to take part to work up proposals, as did the South Basildon and East Thurrock MP Stephen Metcalfe. Named the ‘Canvey West Access Taskforce’, its aim was to come up with a fully costed proposal and business plan for another access that I could then take to the Government and lobby for the funding to make it happen.\nA new administration made up of a coalition between the Canvey Island Independent Party and The People’s Independent Party took over at Castle Point Borough Council in May 2022 and I am sorry to say that they have not held a single taskforce meeting since. This is a source of great frustration to myself and many residents, as we had all the right people sitting around the table to get a workable proposal together and yet the opportunity to get moving on it over 18 months ago was wasted. In fairness, Castle Point Borough Council have stated they are now pursuing a third access via the Association of South Essex Local Authorities. I am afraid however I have not seen any evidence that the matter is progressing.\nIt is clear a third access for the island is needed, and I as the local MP continue to stand ready to go into bat for the funding with the Government when a business case and plan has been put together. I am afraid however that that plan must come from the group of local authorities that would need to be involved and I have seen no sign of that happening any time soon.\nIn October 2019, I held a joint meeting with Essex County Council in Parliament. I convinced the Business Minister of the case and he's agreed it should happen and has told the Department of Transport he is backing it. With that green light I wanted to pull together a Taskforce to drive the project forward.\nPreviously in 2016 I met with the Chancellor, along with other South Essex MPs, at Number 11 to discuss infrastructure needs for the region. I was delighted that the Chancellor raised the issue of a third road for Canvey when I spoke with him. I successfully lobbied the previous Chancellor, George Osborne, to include a commitment to ‘look at the case for the Canvey Island Third Road’ in the 2016 Budget. I have encouraged Essex County Council to make the economic case to the Treasury for the project following the announcement in the Budget. As the lead highways authority, Essex County Council is responsible for delivering major highways projects across Essex.\nBefore that in 2013 I hosted the Ministerial visit of Brandon Lewis MP to Canvey to see James Heyes Recycling, Thames Ambulance Group and talk about the campaign for the all-important Third Road off Canvey. Communities and Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis MP visited two private firms with public contracts on Canvey and to hear the economic and regeneration case for the third road off of Canvey Island.\nThe Minister visited the family run James Heyes Reycling on Northwick Road which holds many contracts for waste recycling across Essex before visiting a possible site for a third road at the end of Northwick Road. He then met Directors and employees of the Thames Ambulance Group at their HQ on Charfleets industrial estate before meeting the Leader and Chief Executive of Castle Point Borough Council to hear the technical regeneration case for a third road first hand.\nFollowing that I also secured a meeting with local Councillors and Council officials to discuss the matter at the Department of Transport with the Secretary of State.",

The scheme, started in 1989, is a privately run initiative developed to give members the opportunity to experience first hand the ethos and culture of the Defence community.\nThroughout the two day visit the peers, MPs and MEPs attend a series of presentations on the role of the military in a modern democracy and the strategic context for defence. The scheme provides a mixture of discussion groups on the realities of conflict and practical sessions on handling weapons and equipment.\nThe visit offers parliamentarians the chance to meet with senior members of the Defence Academy personnel for informal discussions across a range of issues, as well as including briefings from representatives of service charities such as SSAFA and Help for Heroes. Rebecca is firmly of the view that Members of Parliament have a duty to have a greater understanding of the issues facing the armed forces.

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_north-benfleet-hall-farm-development/content_45.html": "I share residents' concerns about the potential of 1800 new homes being built on Green Belt at North Benfleet Hall Farm. If you have not already I would urge you to take part in the consultation here: croudace-northbenfleet.co.uk/feedback/\nYou can find my initial response to the developers below:\n\"I am writing on behalf of the people of the villages of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet, and the neighbouring Borough of Castle Point, to object to your proposal to cram in a development of 1800 homes on Green Belt at North Benfleet Hall Farm.\nSince I was first elected as a local MP in 2010, I have always stood with residents when they oppose the development of the treasured and unspoiled local Green Belt that is so central to the semi-rural character of the local villages and towns they surround. This is one such case.\nIn the eyes of local residents, the semi-rural village feel of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet is what makes the area a great place to live. In fact, it is why many residents moved there in the first place. This huge development risks wiping out the village feel so central to the identity of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet, in effect making the area into a dormitory town.\nThe Bowers Gifford Parish Council are opposed to development of this scale on this location and they have my full support. Whilst they take the measured approach of supporting a development of around four hundred to five hundred homes on part of the site, as the democratic body closest to the community and the families that live in the local area, they have deep concerns about the strain on every aspect of local infrastructure this development would impose, and its effect on the every-day life of residents who already live here. As a developer promoting this site I urge you to engage closely with the parish council and both listen to and act on their concerns.\nAs you are aware, the local planning authority Basildon Borough Council are in the process of putting together a new Local Plan. I understand that Basildon Borough Council are facing huge pressure to build from central government, not least due to the Deputy Prime Minister creating a mandatory housing target far greater than their previously objectively assessed housing need. I also understand that new government legislation that could see farmland being compulsory purchased for development and move to reclassify some Green Belt as ‘Grey Belt’ has put pressure on local landowners. However, Basildon Borough Council have not yet finished their plan and the Council lists a number of negative planning factors related to the use of this site for housing in their site assessment report. These include concerns about pollution, distance from economic centres, proximity to protected habitats, and flood risk.\nOne of the biggest issues of concern, not just for residents in Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet, but also for the residents of Canvey Island, South Benfleet and Thundersley, is road infrastructure and transport. The local road network is creaking already and neither Pound Lane, nor Sadlers Farm, will be able to take the extra traffic movements from this site without significant investment that you make no mention of.

I would be grateful if you could extend that invitation on my behalf.\nIf and when you decide to submit a planning application for this development, I will go into detail on behalf of residents at that stage depending on the specifics of the application, but these are issues that clearly make the principle of such a large scale development on that site unviable.\nIn the meantime, I am grateful that you have begun to consult with local residents and stakeholders so early in the process. I am also grateful that you have taken on board my request for further consultation events.\nOn behalf of the residents of Bowers Gifford, North Benfleet and the whole Borough of Castle Point, I would be very grateful if you would take on board the concerns of local residents with the principle of the proposed development and pass onto the developers the message that local residents are wholly opposed to development of such a huge and unviable scale on that site.\"",

If you have not already I would urge you to take part in the consultation here: croudace-northbenfleet.co.uk/feedback/\nYou can find my initial response to the developers below:\n\"I am writing on behalf of the people of the villages of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet, and the neighbouring Borough of Castle Point, to object to your proposal to cram in a development of 1800 homes on Green Belt at North Benfleet Hall Farm.\nSince I was first elected as a local MP in 2010, I have always stood with residents when they oppose the development of the treasured and unspoiled local Green Belt that is so central to the semi-rural character of the local villages and towns they surround. This is one such case.\nIn the eyes of local residents, the semi-rural village feel of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet is what makes the area a great place to live. In fact, it is why many residents moved there in the first place. This huge development risks wiping out the village feel so central to the identity of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet, in effect making the area into a dormitory town.\nThe Bowers Gifford Parish Council are opposed to development of this scale on this location and they have my full support. Whilst they take the measured approach of supporting a development of around four hundred to five hundred homes on part of the site, as the democratic body closest to the community and the families that live in the local area, they have deep concerns about the strain on every aspect of local infrastructure this development would impose, and its effect on the every-day life of residents who already live here. As a developer promoting this site I urge you to engage closely with the parish council and both listen to and act on their concerns.\nAs you are aware, the local planning authority Basildon Borough Council are in the process of putting together a new Local Plan. I understand that Basildon Borough Council are facing huge pressure to build from central government, not least due to the Deputy Prime Minister creating a mandatory housing target far greater than their previously objectively assessed housing need. I also understand that new government legislation that could see farmland being compulsory purchased for development and move to reclassify some Green Belt as ‘Grey Belt’ has put pressure on local landowners. However, Basildon Borough Council have not yet finished their plan and the Council lists a number of negative planning factors related to the use of this site for housing in their site assessment report. These include concerns about pollution, distance from economic centres, proximity to protected habitats, and flood risk.\nOne of the biggest issues of concern, not just for residents in Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet, but also for the residents of Canvey Island, South Benfleet and Thundersley, is road infrastructure and transport. The local road network is creaking already and neither Pound Lane, nor Sadlers Farm, will be able to take the extra traffic movements from this site without significant investment that you make no mention of. This also needs to be taken in the context of the development of the Castle Point Borough Council Local Plan, which again thanks to central government housing targets, is likely to see significant development that will also add pressure to the already overloaded Sadlers Farm junction.\nI can think of no better way to illustrate the problem than to invite the directors of the development company to accompany me on a drive from the development site to Canvey Island seafront for an ice cream at 6:00PM on a working weeknight of their choosing. I would be grateful if you could extend that invitation on my behalf.\nIf and when you decide to submit a planning application for this development, I will go into detail on behalf of residents at that stage depending on the specifics of the application, but these are issues that clearly make the principle of such a large scale development on that site unviable.\nIn the meantime, I am grateful that you have begun to consult with local residents and stakeholders so early in the process.

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_my-view-nhs/content_75.html": "The Conservatives have been running our NHS for 48 of its 75 years, and I fundamentally believe it’s there for everyone in the country to rely on free at the point of use.\nThe NHS is still recovering from the pandemic but has 42,000 more doctors and 71,000 more nurses than under Labour with 250 more doctors and 400 more nurses for every month we’ve been in office. Resources matter, which is why, despite all the economic shocks we have faced, overall spending on public services has gone up since 2010 – in the case of the NHS by over 33% in real terms.\nRecord NHS Funding\nThe Spring Budget 2024 announced that the Government is protecting the day-to-day funding of the National Health Service in England, providing an extra £2.45 billion in 2024/25. This will allow the NHS to continue to focus on reducing waiting times and bring the NHS’s resource budget in 2024/25 to £164.9 billion. This means that NHS funding equates to a real-terms increase of 13% since 2019/20. Our NHS is set to be in receipt of £1 billion more per week than in 2016.\nIn our area, we have also seen a further £8 million invested into A&E services alongside a surgical day unit at Southend Hospital and a further £110 million investment at Basildon, Broomfield and Southend Hospitals. Once opened, the day unit will offer a further 5,600 procedures a year, helping reduce patient waiting lists.\nPrivate sector involvement in the NHS / ‘Privatisation’\nA Conservative Government will not privatise the NHS. The NHS will always be free at the point of use.\nThe use of private providers and the voluntary sector in the delivery of NHS services is not a new concept. The Labour Government between 1997 and 2010 introduced the independent sector and competition into the NHS. The focus throughout the NHS is to provide the highest quality of care to patients, and that is completely shared by the Government.\nThe most obvious example of this is local GP services. GP surgeries have always been private companies, but are paid for directly by the Government, ensuring they remain free to patients. Another example of the NHS using private companies to satisfy certain needs is their use of pharmaceutical companies to provide the medicine we and our families need.\nThe use of private providers in the NHS represents just over seven pence in every pound the NHS spends, an increase of just two and a half pence in the pound since 2010, and a slower rate of growth than under Labour. Charities and social enterprises, such as Macmillan Nurses, continue to play an important role in the NHS, as they have done for many years.\nThis is about offering patients more choice, control and driving up the quality of their care, and the idea that this will have a negative impact on healthcare and patients is wrong. Patients have already had choice for non-urgent hospital treatments like joint replacements for several years and this hasn't destabilised services.\nTrade Deals\nThe comments made by in the summer by the President of the United States about a potential US-UK trade agreement caused many people to worry that that the NHS would be “sold off”. This would never happen.\nWhen we hear ‘the NHS is on the table’, the instinct is to think we put at risk our valued, free at the point of need system in favour of the massively expensive, unequal, and inferior American system. That is something we would never want to do in this country.\nPresident Trump subsequently backtracked on his remarks when it was explained to him how it would have been mis-interpreted by British people. Following the US state visit, I am glad that the President clarified to his remarks, as he stated: \"I don't see it [the NHS] being on the table\" in negotiations.\nHowever, the NHS is a huge purchaser of medicines, mechanical equipment, and technology. Any future trade deal with the US could see us reduce tariffs on American goods, therefore reducing their costs. As such, a future trade deal with the USA could, for example, include the sale of scanners and drugs, however, this does not mean the NHS itself is on the negotiating table or for sale. Any resources purchased from America will only be used to improve the service provided by the NHS, while remaining free at the point of delivery for everyone.\nWhilst no trade deal relating to the NHS has been agreed with the US, should they play a role in improving the provision of health care, let me be abundantly clear: The Government will never change our NHS to an American private healthcare system.\nI wholeheartedly believe that the NHS should be free to all at the point of need, according to requirement and not ability to pay. Our NHS is a national treasure and I am strongly against its privatisation.\nUpgrading 20 hospitals and building 40 new ones\nOn top of more money for the NHS every year, we’re investing in hospitals so that our brilliant doctors and nurses have the facilities they need to give patients the best possible care. We’re providing £850 million for 20 hospital upgrades, £2.7 billion for the first six new hospitals, and seed funding so that work on 34 more can make progress. And 78 hospital trusts will receive state-of-the-art MRI, CT and mammography screening machines, so cancer can be detected more quickly to boost survival rates.\nMaking sure the NHS has the staff it needs\nUnder the Conservatives, there are over 21,000 more doctors and almost 17,000 more nurses on our wards. Over 1 million NHS staff – nurses, midwives and cleaners – are getting a well-deserved pay rise of at least 6.5% per cent and doctors will also see their pay increase. We’re also opening five new medical schools to make sure we can plan for the future with confidence as we train the next generation of NHS staff here at home.\nInvesting in the people at the heart of our NHS\n50,000 more nurses, with students receiving a £5,000-£8,000 annual maintenance grant every year during their course to help with their cost of living – and they won’t have to pay it back.\nEveryone will receive at least £5,000 with further funding in regions or disciplines that are struggling to recruit - such as mental health – and help with their childcare costs. We will improve staff morale with more funding for professional training and more supportive hospital management.\n6,000 more doctors in general practice and 6,000 more primary care professionals, such as physiotherapists and pharmacists. This is on top of the 7,500 extra nurse associates and 20,000 primary care professionals that we have already announced.\n50 million extra GP surgery appointments\nOur new funding will deliver 50 million extra general practice appointments a year, an increase of over 15 per cent. That means that if you need an appointment, waiting times will be shorter and you’ll get the service you deserve.\nThe NHS Visa\nOur NHS People Plan will ensure that we train and employ tens of thousands more NHS professionals here in the UK. But we also want to make sure that those from overseas who want to work in and support our NHS are encouraged to do so.\nThat is why overseas qualified doctors, nurses and allied health professionals with a job offer from the NHS, who have been trained to a recognised standard, and who have good working English, will be offered fast-track entry, reduced visa fees and dedicated support to come to the UK with their families.\nCharging overseas visitors who use the NHS\nI believe that overseas visitors should be able to access our NHS as long as they make a fair contribution, just as the British taxpayer does. The NHS is a national, not an international, health service and I commend the Government's determination to stamp out misuse of the system to ensure it remains free at the point of need in this country.\nI supported the Government's measures in February 2024 raising the Immigration Health Surcharge to £1,035 per person per year for most adults and £776 per person per year for students and children so that we continue to see the funds we need to fund our NHS",

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_waspi-womens-state-pension-age/content_71.html": "The Pensions Act 1995 legislated to equalise the State Pension age as a move towards gender equality. The Pensions Act 2011 included transitional arrangements limiting State Pension age delays. Parliament legislated for a concession worth £1.1 billion which means that no woman will see her pension age change by more than 18 months, relative to the original 1995 Act timetable. The Pensions Acts of 1995, 2007, and 2011 were all subject to public consultation and debate in Parliament and were all widely reported in the media. The changes in the 1995 legislation were communicated in leaflets, advertising campaigns, and individual letters. The up-to-date State Pension age was also provided to those who requested a Pension Statement.\nIn 2016 I met with local campaigners from Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) group who spoke to me about their experiences, and I raised their cases and complaints with the Government at that time.\nIn the 2019-2021 Judicial Review on changes to State Pension age, both the High Court and Court of Appeal supported the actions of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), finding it acted entirely lawfully and did not discriminate on any grounds. A copy of the judgment can be found here. In March 2021 the Supreme Court refused the Claimants' permission to appeal and while I understand it may be disappointing the Government confirmed it would not be reviewing the state pension age in response to the WASPI campaign.\nParliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman - April 2024 Update\nI was pleased to see the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) investigation into the way that changes to the state pension age were communicated to women born in the 1950s by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\nThis was a significant investigation by the Ombudsman, taking over five years to look at a subject spanning nearly 30 years, starting from the 1995 Pensions Act which legislated to equalise the state pension age gradually between men and women from 2010. The Ombudsman has not looked at the decision to equalise the state pension age, but at how that decision was communicated by the Department for Work and Pensions.\nThe PHSO’s report has now been laid before Parliament and I was reassured to see the Secretary of State confirm that the Government will now assess the findings in full and would update MPs on any further action that may be taken.

The bus fare cap had been due to rise to £2.50 but thanks to the Conservative Government’s decision to reinvest HS2 funding in ‘Network North’, it will remain at £2 across most of England until the end of December 2024.\nThe £2 bus fare has helped the cost of bus fares fall across England outside London by 7.4%, whereas in Labour-run London fares have risen 6%, in Labour-run Wales up 6.3% and SNP-run Scotland they have risen 10.3%.\nThis comes on top of the £4.89 million Government investment in bus services awarded to Essex County Council for 2024/25 as part of the £80 million Bus Services Improvement Plan and a further £140 million from the extension of the Bus Service Operators Grant.\nMay 2023:\nRebecca Harris MP Welcomes £4,890,976 of Conservative Government Funding to Extend the £2 Bus Fare Cap Across Essex\n- Millions of bus passengers across the country will continue to benefit from the £2 bus fare cap thanks to the Conservative Government.\n- Supported by £200 million of Conservative Government funding, bus routes across the country will continue to cost passengers no more than £2 until October this year, and a further £300 million has been announced to protect vital routes and improve services.\n- This means millions of passengers will benefit from cheap travel, as the Conservative Government supports people with the cost of living and works to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, stop the boats and cut waiting lists.\nRebecca Harris has welcomed £4,890,976 of Conservative Government funding for bus companies and Essex County Council to extend the £2 bus fare cap, as part of a £500 million investment to freeze bus fares nationally and improve vital local routes – ensuring passengers can continue to ‘Get Around for £2’ while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the sector.\nAlthough the initial cap – announced at the start of this year – was introduced as a temporary measure, the scheme has successfully encouraged many more people to use local bus services, benefitting local economies, supporting jobs, and helping passengers with the cost of living.\nA further £300 million has been announced to protect routes and services that are relied on for work, education, medical appointments, and shopping. As part of this, local transport authorities will receive £160 million to improve fares, services, and infrastructure, while £140 million will directly support operators in protecting essential services.\nCommenting, Rebecca Harris MP said:\n“Buses are vital to people across Castle Point, helping people to access work, education, shops, and appointments – and keeping the cost of fares down will make a real difference to the lives of the millions of people who use them every day.\n“That is why I am delighted the Conservative Government will be committing £500 million across the country, extending the £2 cap fare and protecting and improving vital local routes.\n“This will help people to keep costs down, as the Conservative Government work to halve inflation, grow the economy, and reduce debt.”\nCommenting, Transport Secretary, Mark Harper, said:\n“Taking the bus is the most popular form of public transport and millions of people rely on these vital services every day.\n“This half a billion pounds investment will help people save money amid cost of living pressures and continue to level up transport in all parts of the country, doing our bit to help halve inflation and grow the economy.”\nJuly 2022:\nRebecca met with the Commercial Director of First Essex Buses at the Hadleigh Bus Depot to discuss Thundersley residents' concerns over the alterations to the No.21 bus route.

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_conversion-therapy/content_62.html": "I support banning Conversion Therapy and the Government will bring forward plans for a ban shortly. The suggestion that being LGBT can be “cured” is both morally and medically wrong and the concept of conversion therapy has no place in our society. Being lesbian, gay or bisexual is not an illness to be treated or cured.\nI am glad that this view is shared by the head of the NHS, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the UK Council for Psychotherapy, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and the British Medical Association. Each of these bodies have concluded that such therapy is unethical and potentially harmful.\nLed by colleagues in the Government Equalities Office, research is underway to look at the experiences of those subjected to conversion therapy. I have received assurances that Ministers are thoroughly considering all legislative and non-legislative options in order to end conversion therapy practice for good, and will outline their plans in due course.\nThe Minister for Equalities, Kemi Badenoch speaking at the LGBT Conversion Therapy Debate on Monday 8 March 2021\n\"It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr Gray. May I start by thanking those who signed the petition for raising the important issue of conversion therapy, and my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Elliot Colburn) for introducing the debate? I also thank all colleagues for speaking so passionately about this issue. I know how important it is to so many parliamentarians, and it is right that we should have this time to debate it. I will endeavour to answer the various questions put this evening.\nI am pleased to be able to respond not just to acknowledge the importance of the topic but to say more about the Government’s approach to ending conversion therapy. We have a proud record of championing equal opportunity, and it is of great importance to me and the Government that everyone has the freedom to live their life as they see fit without fear or intimidation.\nI assure hon. Members that we are committed to ending conversion therapy in the UK and we take the issue very seriously. The Prime Minister reiterated recently that we want to end conversion therapy and underlined that the practice has “no place in a civilised society”.\nIt is indeed shocking to think that conversion therapy practices still take place in modern Britain, yet the 2017 national LGBT survey found that 5% of respondents—people in the UK—had been offered conversion therapy and 2% had undergone it. The national LGBT survey was launched in 2017 and received more than 108,000 responses, making it the largest survey of its kind in the UK. The aim was to gather more information about the life experiences of LGBT people in the UK and the biggest difficulties they face, including conversion therapy.\nAcknowledging that conversion therapy is wrong and should end is only the first step in tackling such behaviours. The Government want to ensure that we correctly identify and capture these harmful practices. To do that, we have been working hard to establish a clear view of what constitutes conversion therapy. “Conversion therapy” is often used as an umbrella term for a number of acts. On the most egregious end of the spectrum are acts of violence. Around the world, sexual violence, including rape, is used in sinister attempts supposedly to cure someone of an innate aspect of their person. People may also be beaten, or forced to fast or to take snake-oil medicines, all because of who they are and who they love. We are fortunate that in this country we have cultivated a robust criminal law framework for dealing with those types of conversion therapy.\nI would like to take this opportunity to be clear that if someone commits an existing offence in the course of conversion therapy, they will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, no matter what their reason for doing so is. At the extreme end of such practices, someone could face charges of rape or grievous bodily harm. At the other end of the spectrum are acts that are primarily delivered through the spoken word or through the guise of healthcare support, such as advertising and selling products, or charging a fee to undergo conversion therapy practices.\nThe Government have been clear that we do not intend to stop those who wish to seek spiritual counselling as they explore their sexual orientation, but there will be cases when a line is crossed, where someone is actively seeking to change another’s sexual orientation—an innate aspect of their personal identity—via coercion under the guise of spiritual support. The Government will exercise great care when considering what does and does not constitute conversion therapy, and how to intervene. Just because greater care is required, however, it does not mean that we should shy from protecting our most vulnerable from those practices.\nIt is clear that conversion therapy is associated with significant mental health problems and isolation from a support network. That, in turn, can lead to homelessness and abuse. We are also alive to the need to ensure that the action we take does not push those practices underground, which could ultimately cause more harm to those who are victim to them. Our response to the issue will ensure that we end those practices, not hide them.\nIt may help to explain the work that the Government are doing to tackle conversion therapy. Officials are undertaking a review of the current legislative framework to see how conversion therapy can be stopped by making use of existing laws and offences. As I have mentioned previously, many acts of conversion therapy are already illegal, including sexual violence and kidnapping, as well as inciting violence. People who engage in those criminal activities can and will be prosecuted for doing so. Where dangerous practices are not already unlawful, we are examining the best ways to stop them without sending them underground.\nThe Government believe that a comprehensive approach is needed to end the suffering that those practices inflict. We need to explore all measures to combat those abhorrent practices, ensuring that survivors have access to the help and care that they need. In addition to the work on legislative and non-legislative measures to end conversion therapy, we have commissioned research into the scope of practices and the experiences of those subjected to conversion therapy, so that we can fully consider the needs of all those whom it affects. That is important in our approach to establishing the most effective way to stop it happening. Once the findings have been reviewed, we will continue to engage with key stakeholders to ensure that we progress an effective approach as quickly as we can.\nI know that there may be questions around what a legal ban could include, and we have heard a number of views on that. We are actively considering that issue, on which we have been consulting widely to seek a broad range of views. We will continue that engagement to ensure that any action that we take is proportionate and effective. As I said earlier, I want to make it absolutely clear that we do not want to prevent LGBT people from seeking support on their own terms. People will always have the right to seek support from anyone and have conversations to rationalise and understand their own identity. We will not restrict the right to seek counsel when needed, but that does not mean that we will tolerate the use of conversion therapy described in the debate. We are working to understand the impacts on wider rights and freedoms of any Government action to tackle conversion therapy. The legal landscape is complex, and we want to ensure that we get our proposals absolutely right.\nWe will continue to engage with religious organisations and groups to understand how best support to LGBT people of faith. It is not the place of Government to dictate what is legitimate spiritual guidance, but it is the Government’s place to protect all their citizens, and we will not tolerate the use of harmful coercive practices under the guise of spiritual support. I am also pleased that all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies in the UK have agreed to tackle conversion therapy in healthcare settings. We will engage with experts to understand the best way of ending conversion therapy in these contexts in a targeted and proportionate way.\nIt is also encouraging to see jurisdictions around the world starting to take notice of the issue, and join us with their own commitments to ending conversion therapy. We are in conversations with international counterparts, both those who have introduced a variety of legislative and non-legislative actions and those who plan to. Although it is important to figure out what will work in a UK context, we may also look to our friends around the world to understand the effectiveness of different approaches. Hon. Members have mentioned, for example, that Germany has implemented a ban on conversion therapy for minors only, or when an adult has been coerced, and I understand that other countries such as Malta have also taken this route. However, we understand that different countries will take different approaches that best suit their needs. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach.\nThe safety of LGBT people in the UK in every aspect of their life is of the utmost importance to me, including in our work on conversion therapy. However, this is only part of the work we are doing to promote equality for everyone. The Government understand that colleagues across the House who have taken the time to attend the debate are passionate about the work that my officials and I are doing, so I wish to update them on all the broader LGBT work we are undertaking. In April 2019, we appointed Dr Michael Brady of King’s College Hospital to be the first national adviser on LGBT healthcare. This appointment shows the Government’s commitment to improving healthcare for all. I am very proud that in December 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care announced that men who have sex with men in a long-term relationship will be able to donate blood in England, following changes to blood donation criteria that will be implemented in the summer.\nI am also aware that waiting times for gender identity services are currently very long. We are taking meaningful actions to address the historical problems that have resulted in long waiting times, and I am pleased that we will establish at least three new gender identity clinics over 2021, with the first of these opened by the Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust in July. This is the first service of its kind established in the NHS in England for around 20 years.\nThere is so much more that I would say about the work that the Government are doing, but I am afraid that we are out of time. Our goal now is to end these harmful practices, and we are going to engage widely and listen carefully so that we can develop measures that end them for good. I know that all Members are keen to know the timetable. We continue to work to ensure that the actions we take are proportionate and effective, and will set out our next steps soon. We have heard a range of views and voices, and it is imperative that we continue a constructive dialogue to ensure that we get our proposals right. To answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams), officials from the Government Equalities Office have been in liaison with Welsh Government officials, and the Welsh Government have not requested devolved competence.\nPut simply, being LGBT is not an illness to be treated or cured. This is an issue that has cross-party support, and the call to end conversion therapy is backed by those in the health, counselling and psychotherapy industry. I am absolutely committed to ensuring that LGBT people can be truly safe and free to live their life as they wish, and this will be the next important step in ending conversion therapy for good.\nI take this opportunity to thank all colleagues who have spoken in today’s debate in support of ending conversion therapy. It is wonderful to see so many people united against this abhorrent practice, and I look forward to many more debates on the issue. I am happy to continue individual engagement, as I have already done, where there are further questions.\"\nUpdate: 11th May 2021\nAs set out in the Queen’s speech - which outlines the Government’s policies and proposed legislation for the new parliamentary session - at the state reopening of Parliament, the Government proposes to ban conversion therapy in England and Wales.\nHowever, a short public consultation will be opened before the legislation to ban conversion therapy is finalised, asking the public and interested parties how best to address the problem. The consultation will consider religious freedom and how to protect professionals, including therapists. The consultation will examine how to ensure professionals, such as therapists, can still help people fully explore their gender identity. The Government also wants legitimate forms of pastoral support to be allowed to continue.\nThe ban will apply to England and Wales, and a support fund for victims of the practice will also be made available. This will do exactly what the Government promised to do - banning LGBT conversion therapy in legislation and stamping out the last vestiges of this heinous practice.",

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_trade-act-2021/content_58.html": "JULY 2020: Following votes on the Trade Bill, Labour have been spreading disinformation about the NHS & food standards.\nThe Trade Bill only deals with continuity trade agreements carrying over from those already in place as an EU member, purely to ensure trade continues as before – it has nothing to do with future Free Trade Agreements. It will continue to be for UK Government to decide how to deliver health services, and their priority will remain how best to serve the interests of patients. The NHS will never be on the table in any trade deal under this Government, and that includes the price we pay for drugs.\nBackground\nThe Trade Bill is an important piece of legislation which has a number of practical functions. The UK has been working to reach continuity agreements with countries who we currently trade with through EU trade deals. The Trade Bill will enable these continuity agreements to be embedded into UK law so that the agreements can be fully implemented.\nIn addition, in leaving the EU, the UK will be acceding to the World Trade Organisation’s Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) in its own right. The Bill’s provisions will make sure the UK can implement procurement obligations under the Agreement, ensuring continued access to £1.3 trillion per year of global procurement opportunities for UK businesses.\nThe Bill will also facilitate the creation of a new independent Trade Remedies Authority (TRA), to deliver a new UK trade remedies framework, which among other things will include protections for UK businesses from unfair trade practices or unforeseen import surges. The TRA will also investigate the effects of different markets on the UK to ensure fair trade practice and avoid goods dumping.\nIt is important to make clear that the Trade Bill is a continuity Bill, and its functions are largely distinct from the Government’s future trade agreements programme. Indeed, the Bill cannot be used to implement new free trade agreements with countries such as the US. The Bill simply enables the 40 free trade agreements that the EU had signed with third countries before the UK exited to be transitioned. Separate work on the future trade agreements programme is also pressing ahead, with negotiations already underway with the US, Australia and New Zealand.\nMore trade is essential if the UK is to overcome the unprecedented economic challenge posed by coronavirus and succeed in the longer-term. New Free Trade Agreements are a powerful way to deliver greater prosperity, better jobs, higher wages, more choice and lower prices. Government analysis shows that ambitious trade agreements, such as with the US, could positively impact every part of the UK. There are gains to be had for almost every industry, from agriculture to businesses services.\nRigorous checks and balances on the Government’s power to negotiate and ratify new agreements also already exist, including through the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. Moreover, trade agreements cannot by themselves make changes to our domestic law. Any legislative changes required as a result of trade agreements would be subject to the separate scrutiny and approval of Parliament. Following the votes on the Trade Bill Parliament still retains any right to block any treaty from being ratified and will retain the right to reject any domestic implementing legislation necessary for a trade treaty.\nNHS\nI understand the concerns that many Castle Point residents hold, and I wish to make clear: The NHS is NOT for sale. The NHS will always be free at the point of use. This fear was brought up during the election and is simply anti-trade scaremongering by Labour. The Trade Bill cannot be used to implement future trade deals. It was absolutely not about the content of future trade deals and the future of the NHS, and it is misleading to claim otherwise.\nProtecting the NHS goes to the heart of our negotiations. Our detailed negotiating objectives for new free trade agreements include:\n- Protecting the right to regulate public services, including in the NHS\n- On investment maintaining the right to regulate in the national interest and continue to protect the NHS\n- Ensuring patent provisions do not lead to increased medicines prices for the NHS\n- Making sure that Government Procurement maintains existing protections for NHS health services.\nNHS will also be protected in any future trade agreement, including one with the US. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table, and nor will the services the NHS provides.\nREAD MORE: https://www.rebeccaharris.org/my-view-nhs\nFood Standards\nThe Trade Bill only deals with continuity trade agreements carrying over from those already in place as an EU member, purely to ensure trade continues as before – it has nothing to do with future Free Trade Agreements.\nRegarding the potential for future free trade deals with countries such as the United States, I am reassured by my Ministerial colleagues’ commitment not to compromise the UK’s high animal welfare, environmental, food safety and food import standards in any future FTA, including one with the US. Ministers do not intend to compromise the UK’s domestic welfare production standards either.\nOur import standards include a ban on all artificial growth hormones in domestic and imported products and set out that no products, other than potable water, are used to decontaminate poultry carcases. Imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone injected beef are not permitted into the UK. All imports must meet our strict food safety standards. When we leave the transition period, all high food safety standards will be carried over into UK law and Parliament will retain the final say over such standards.\nNew clause 11, and new clause 7 would have significant unforeseen consequences and could well endanger existing trade. For example, the UK operates trade on the grounds of adherence to sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements only and the UK does not require other countries who trade with us to follow our own domestic regulations, whether we trade on WTO terms or through preferential trade agreements. This is not a UK-specific position. Existing trade agreements in place around the world do not require partner countries to operate by another country’s domestic regulations and standards; doing so would be unprecedented. If the UK were to insist on its domestic regulations being applicable to imports then it would create new barriers to trade for our own exporters, including our own farmers. In addition, if the UK adopted such a position it would hurt developing nations where access to UK markets is key to lifting millions out of extreme poverty.\n\"The Opposition think they are talking about chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, but are they actually able to look people in the eye and say that cocoa from the Ivory Coast has been produced to at least as high environmental standards as in the UK? Are they able to say that beans from Egypt are being produced to at least as high labour standards? Are they able to say that tea from Sri Lanka comes with the same high labour standards? I think they are putting a lot of this country’s existing trade at risk.\"- Greg Hands MP: 20/07/20\nREAD MORE: https://www.rebeccaharris.org/standards-after-brexit",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_all-party-parliamentary-groups-0/content_7.html": "All Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) are cross party groups run by and for members of the House of Commons and House of Lords who informally meet together to discuss a particular issue of concern. There are hundreds of APPGs covering almost every interest and issue you could imagine. Throughout her Parliamentary career, Rebecca has been an active member of a number of APPGs, and these groups reflects some of the issues Rebecca feels passionately about.\nAPPG on Brain Tumours\nRebecca was the Chair of the APPG on Brain Tumours. The purpose of this group was to raise awareness of the issues facing the brain tumour community to improve research, diagnosis, information, support, treatment and care outcomes. Following the tragic story of Danny Green, an 11 year old Canvey resident who died from a brain tumor, Rebecca campaigned for more funding for Brain Tumor Research and was very pleased in 2018 when the Department of Health and Social Care and Cancer Research UK pledged an additional £45 million for the cause.\nAPPG on Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency\nRebecca was also the co-Chair of the APPG on Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency. Rebecca is a strong advocate for fuel and energy issues. The aim of this APPG was to maintain awareness in Parliament of fuel poverty issues through; monitoring and commenting on progress against Government targets to eradicate fuel poverty and advocating policies to deliver affordable warmth for vulnerable households.\nAPPG on Maths and Numeracy\nRebecca was a founding member of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Maths and Numeracy. This APPG sought to raise the profile of numeracy issues among Parliamentarians, and make recommendations on improving adult numeracy and the teaching of maths in schools. A proper grasp of maths and a decent level of numeracy are essential tools in the lives of everyone, and Rebecca believes that everyone should have the support they need to improve their skills.\nAPPG on Small Business\nHaving spent her career before becoming a Member of Parliament as a businesswoman, Rebecca is fully aware of the vital role that small business plays in our economy. Small businesses are the backbone of the United Kingdom. This group aimed to highlight issues faced by small businesses and their owners and to raise those issues in Parliament.\nAPPG for Visteon Pensioners\nThis APPG was set up to support the pensioners of the former Visteon UK after the bankruptcy proceedings against the company. Following a long four year campaign, Rebecca and a number of her colleagues celebrated a victory for the Visteon Pensioners when Ford agreed to enter into constructive and binding talks with the view to settle claims for losses with a multi-million pound deal secured shortly after.\nAPPG for Metal Theft\nThis group focused on the scourge of metal theft affecting the UK, consider its impacts and look at possible solutions to this issue. This group invited non-parliamentary membership from amongst the affected sectors and the wider community to effectively tackle the problem.\nAPPG on Air Ambulances\nThis APPG aimed to raise the quality of care, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Air Ambulance Services for Patients through closer engagement with political leaders and policy makers. This Group was influential in bringing about the cut in VAT on fuel for air ambulances announced by Chancellor George Osborne in the 2014 Autumn Statement. This was fantastic news for Essex Air Ambulance in Rebecca's constituency.",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_nhs-pay/content_76.html": "In these most difficult of times and with ever increasing pressures on the NHS, they work incredibly hard, always putting patients first and keeping them safe whilst providing the high-quality care we all expect. Many NHS staff are already benefitting from the most significant pay reforms in a decade, with similar reforms planned for other staff groups.\nNHS pay rises\nThe independent Pay Review Bodies make annual recommendations on pay rises for NHS staff. The Pay Review Bodies are made up of experts and their recommendations are based on comprehensive assessment of evidence from key stakeholders, including NHS system partners and trade unions. The Department of Health and Social Care has reached multi-year pay and contract reform agreements with trade unions across the NHS workforce.\n2024 Update\nThe NHS Long Term Workforce Plan was announced last year and is the first of its kind – a plan asked for and created by the NHS itself and backed by £2.4 billion of Government investment to ‘Train, Retain, Reform’.\nIt sets out really ambitious proposals including a doubling of medical school places, increasing GP training by 50% and dentists by 40% and an aim for 130,000 fewer staff leaving the profession over the next 15 years by making the NHS a more attractive career to pursue. Most recently, the Government abolished the lifetime allowance on pensions to make sure those who want to work within the health service are not penalised for doing so.\nThe Government has now delivered its manifesto commitment of an additional 50,000 nurses working in the service who are performing a record number of procedures. The plan also includes proposals to recruit 60,000 more doctors, 170,000 more nurses and 71,000 more healthcare professionals by 2036/37. There is also an additional £7.5 billion allocated to social care for 2023-25 to ensure they have the resources needed to care for a growing number of people.\nI know that we all value the work that the NHS carries out and so I am pleased the Government last year accepted in full the recommendations of the independent pay bodies. This meant that most doctors and dentists received a 6% pay rise last year. Over 1 million staff, including nurses and paramedics, received a pay rise of 5% and two one-off payments worth on average over £2,000. Junior doctors also received a 10.3% uplift, with the offer of further discussions about improving working conditions, to end the strikes we have seen. The discussions for the 2024/25 pay settlement are now underway.\nAgenda for Change\nThe Agenda for Change is supported by the majority of trades unions and their members, delivers pay awards and contract reforms over three years from 2018/2019 to 2020/2021.\nStaff (including nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and others) on the Agenda for Change (AfC) deal are already scheduled to receive pay rises, with the starting salary for a newly qualified nurse increased by more than 12 per cent by the end of the AfC time period, with all nurses receiving pay increases of at least 6.5 per cent and paramedics receiving up to 11 per cent.\nThe multi-year deal is already benefiting around one million NHS staff. Over the three years:\n- Staff below the top of their pay band will receive pay increases of at least 9%; pay for most staff at the top of their pay band will rise by 6.5%;\n- Those on the lowest salaries in the NHS are seeing some of the largest proportionate pay rises: the lowest NHS starting salary has increased year on year from £15,404 to £18,005 in 2020/2021. Many nurses and healthcare assistants have seen pay increases of at least 2.5 per cent.\n- Raising the starting salary for a newly qualified nurse by over 12% to nearly £25,000\n- The reforms agreed are not just about headline pay but changes that will help improve the working lives of our dedicated staff. For example, by supporting them to maintain their physical and mental health and wellbeing and introducing policies to help support staff to balance their working lives with family and personal commitments.\nI understand that the NHS Pay Review Body, covering AfC staff, will return to making recommendations for pay awards during 2021. I will continue to monitor this issue closely, and await the recommendations of the NHS Pay Review Body.\nJunior doctors are also benefiting from a multi-year agreement (2019/20 to 2022/23) which:\n- ensures all pay scales increase by at least 8.2% over the four years;\n- includes a new higher pay point for around 1 in 8 junior doctors to reflect their level of responsibility; increases enhancements for those working the most onerous shifts; and further strengthens safety and rest limits.\nThe reward package also includes a pension scheme which is one of the best available. Members of the scheme can generally expect to receive around £3 to £6 in pension benefits value for every £1 they contribute. The ambition is to reach similar multi-year pay and contract reform agreements with senior medical staff to reflect their roles as leaders in our NHS and attract and retain the specialists we need.\nIn addition to basic pay, staff can expect to receive additional premium rates of pay for working during unsocial hours, agreed overtime and for working in and around London. This can significantly increase the total take home pay received.\nI fully support the Government's announcement of a pay rise of 2.8 per cent, backdated to April 2020, in line with the recommendations of the independent pay review body for dentists and doctors. This pay rise is an important acknowledgment of the commitment and hard work of staff throughout this difficult time.\nGeneral Practice\nIn 2019 NHS England agreed with trade unions a five-year GP contract framework which fixed funding for the core practice contract for five years. The new contract provided funding clarity and certainty to practices and the settlement covers all aspects of practice income and expenses including practice staff pay. The full package for GP contract reform also sought to address workload by providing additional staff though the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme and also saw the introduction of the new state-backed scheme for GP indemnity. As self-employed contractors to the NHS, it is largely up to GP practices how they distribute pay to their employees, although salaried GPs employed within the majority of practices are expected to be on terms and conditions no less favourable than those in the salaried GP model terms and conditions including the minimum and maximum salary. Employers have the flexibility to offer enhanced terms and conditions, for example, to aid recruitment and retention. We anticipate good employers would set wage rates that reflect the skills and experience of their staff.\nDuring Coronavirus:\nNHS staff are playing an integral part of the national effort to combat coronavirus - and we owe them a great deal of gratitude for all that they do. The Government have agreed that staff should receive full pay if they are off sick with COVID-19, or if they must follow advice to self-isolate, in order to help protect NHS staff and patients from the spread of the virus. It is vital we care for those that we all rely on to care for us. The NHS has introduced a free-to-use staff support line and text service which all NHS staff can use for support, signposting and confidential listening from trained respondents. NHS staff have also been given free access to a series of apps to support their mental health and wellbeing.\nThe NHS Long Term Plan outlines the next steps in our mission to make the NHS a world class employer and deliver the workforce the NHS needs. The recently published NHS People Plan sets out the support that NHS staff should expect from their leaders and from each other. The plan sets out practical actions for employers and systems, as well as the actions that NHS England and NHS Improvement and Health Education England will take, over the remainder of 2020/21. It includes specific commitments around:\n- Looking after our people – with quality health and wellbeing support for everyone\n- Belonging in the NHS – with a particular focus on tackling the discrimination that some staff face\n- New ways of working and delivering care – making effective use of the full range of our people’s skills and experience\n- Growing for the future – how we recruit and keep our people, and welcome back colleagues who want to return",

After all, you are my employers and you pay my salary. The simple answer to the question of what I claim is- I don't.\nLike the rest of the public, I was shocked and appalled by the expenses scandal over 10 years ago. I chose to stand for election and being Member of Parliament for Castle Point has been an immense privilege. I have consistently been one of the lowest claiming MPs as I do not see why a Member of Parliament should be able to claim for costs incurred in the job which hard-working members of the public in other jobs cannot.\nThe only costs I claimed in the last session were my office admin costs, the salaries of my staff, and travel and subsistence costs for local youngsters on work experience. I try to offer work experience in my Westminster Office to as many young people from Castle Point as I can, and I know that several of them have since gone on to get good jobs - including two who now work for me full time.

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_environment-climate-change/content_70.html": "Climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face, and I can assure you that I recognise the importance and urgency of action on this issue.\nI am proud of the UK’s world-leading role in tackling climate change and the transition to Clean Growth, with the UK being the first country to legislate to eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050, and the fastest in the G20 to cut emissions. When we achieve net zero, the UK will have eliminated its contribution to climate change, which as of December 2019 accounted for 1.2 per cent of global emissions.\nThe UK has consistently over-delivered on our climate ambitions, with emissions 48% down on 1990 levels and we have seen the fastest decarbonisation in the G7. Technological advances are also progressing way ahead, with wind energy now costing 70% less than predicted in 2016 and we have continually used higher levels of clean energy than we could forecast. The UK is the only country in the world to have a target of 77% emissions reductions compared to 1990 levels by 2035. We remain on target. The UK has even surpassed the targets most countries have set for 2030, such as Australia, Canada, Japan and the US.\nTo continue this momentum, the Government has passed the Environment Act 2021 - a world leading piece of legislation which sets out in law plans to clean up the country’s air, restore natural habitats, increase biodiversity, reduce waste and make better use of our resources.\nIt will halt the decline in species by 2030 and require new developments to improve or create habitats for nature. It will help us transition to a more circular economy, incentivising people to recycle more, encouraging businesses to create sustainable packaging, making household recycling easier and stopping the export of polluting plastic waste to developing countries. These changes will be driven by new legally binding environmental targets and enforced by the new, independent Office for Environmental Protection which will hold the Government and public bodies to account on their environmental obligations.\nThe UK's action on climate change is not limited just to our own borders. I am encouraged that the UK will spend at least £3 billion of international climate finance on nature and biodiversity over five years. The funding will be allocated from the UK’s existing commitment of £11.6 billion for international climate finance and will deliver transformational change in protecting biodiversity-rich land and ocean, shifting to sustainable food production and supply, and supporting the livelihoods of the world’s poorest.\nThe UK’s Presidency of COP26 oversaw some of the largest global agreements on tackling climate change to date including over 90% of the world’s GDP commit to a net zero target, a pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030 signed by 105 countries and over 30 countries and some of the world’s largest car makers committing to work together to make all new car sales zero emission globally by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets.\nGreen Jobs\nNearly 400,000 people are working in the low-carbon economy and the Government is committed to creating thousands of highly skilled, well paid jobs up and down the country. For instance, I welcome that the Offshore Wind Sector Deal could see the number of jobs triple in this sector to 27,000 by 2030.\nThe Ten Point Plan, which will utilise £12 billion of Government investment, will create and support up to 250,000 green jobs. As part of this, the Prime Minister has announced £160 million investment into offshore wind which will create 60,000 jobs.\nThe Government also delivers the Rural Community Energy Fund, a £15 million programme, to support rural communities in England to develop renewable energy projects which provide economic and social benefits to the community.\nRenewables\nThe UK is a world leader in clean growth and with Government support, £92 billion has been invested by businesses in clean energy since 2010. Our renewable capacity has quadrupled since 2010 and the UK has the largest installed offshore wind capacity in the world thanks to our sustained investment in this crucial technology.\nThe Prime Minister has confirmed that the UK will be a world leader in offshore wind as we boost our previous target to deliver up to 30GW of offshore wind, to delivering 40GW by 2030. There is also a new ambition for 1GW of the new 40GW by 2030 target to come from floating offshore wind which is a brand new technology allowing wind farms to be built further out to sea in deeper waters, boosting capacity even further.\nIn addition, the UK's first new nuclear power plant in a generation, Hinkley Point C will provide 7 per cent of the country's energy needs, while renewable capacity has quadrupled since 2010, with capacity in offshore wind set to double throughout the 2020s.\nClimate and Ecological Emergency Bill\nThe Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill is being put forward by campaign groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Big Ask and Power for the People.\nI note that the Bill seeks to examine the UK’s global carbon footprint, such as indirect UK emissions in our supply chain which may affect developing countries. I am encouraged that the UK remains committed to environmentally sustainable development as set out in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. In January 2021, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will spend at least £3 billion of international climate finance on nature and biodiversity over five years. The funding will deliver transformational change in protecting biodiversity-rich land and ocean, shifting to sustainable food production and supply, and supporting the livelihoods of the world’s poorest.\nThe UK is on course to protect over half of our waters. We now have 357 Marine Protected Areas of different types and no activities deemed damaging to designated features will be allowed to take place in these areas.\nI do not believe citizens' assemblies have advantages over conventional policy making in this context. Previous experiences in Canada, for instance, included citizens in the decision-making process but they failed to produce impactful or long-lasting results. I know that a Climate Assembly UK was formed as a result of work conducted by Parliamentary Select Committees. Ministers have assured me the Government will be looking closely at the findings however I welcome that many of their recommendations, which were published in their report, are already either in place or in the pipeline as a result of the Government working towards net zero. Achieving net zero will affect everyone and it is important that we work together to achieve it.\nWhile I welcome the increased awareness and debate the this Bill brings, I do not believe it is required as work is already underway and tackling climate change is a priority.\nEducation\nIt is vital that young people are taught about climate change. This education starts in primary school, and continues in secondary school throughout both the science and geography curricula and GCSEs. Should students wish to specialise in this area, a new environmental science A level was introduced in 2017.\nThe Department for Education also supports energy efficiency in educational facilities through capital funding and programmes, both to reduce the carbon footprint and save schools money on energy. Almost £9 billion has been allocated in condition funding since 2015 to maintain and improve school buildings. Condition funding can be invested in projects which improve energy efficiency. In addition, interest free loans for energy efficiency projects have been made available through the Salix finance scheme.",

For most people, this fare is the same as a ticket bought on the day but customers can also benefit from Monday to Sunday price capping when travelling into and within London.\nCommenting, Rob Mullen, Managing Director at c2c, added:\n“I am delighted that so many of our customers are already choosing to travel using pay as you go with contactless. Right across the route we are seeing thousands of customers using contactless ticketing for their daily commute to work, trips to the shops and for weekend leisure activities.\n“The daily price capping feature for those taking journeys into and around London makes planning and travelling with c2c quicker, more convenient and easier than ever before.\n“Contactless is a great addition to our wide range of ticketing and payment options, and these early figures clearly demonstrate just how popular it is going to be.”",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_environmental-protections/content_74.html": "The Government has a plan for economic growth through investment zones. It is not true to claim we are attacking nature nor going back on our commitments. We have legislated through the ground-breaking Environment Act and will continue to improve our regulations and wildlife laws in line with our ambitious vision. The Environment Act 2021 will deliver one of the most ambitious environmental programmes of any country on earth. Through the Act, the UK will clean up the country’s air, restore natural habitats, increase biodiversity, reduce waste and make better use of our resources. It will halt the decline of species by 2030, clean up our air and protect the health of our rivers, reform how we deal with waste and tackle deforestation overseas.\nHabitat Regulations\nThe Environment Act 2021, which was brought forward by this Government, requires this and all future Governments to set a new, historic legally binding target to be set to halt the decline in species abundance by 2030, as a core part of our commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. Through the Nature Recovery Green Paper, Ministers are exploring proposals to create a system which will better enable the delivery of that target, and which better reflects our domestic species and habitats.\nI would like to assure you that none of the proposals outlined in the Green Paper reduces protections. The proposals seek to make it easier for everyone who engages with protected sites to understand our goals for our sites, reasons for protecting them, and how sites can be effectively managed to achieve nature recovery. The ambition is to create a system that better reflects the latest scientific evidence including the impacts of climate change, the domestic and international importance of our species and habitats, and our significant goals to recover nature, both on land and at sea.\nI understand that the current process highlights where sites are in poor condition. Instead, Ministers want to find opportunities to create a system that better reflects the latest science and finds solutions to help drive nature recovery, maintain protections, and create more upfront certainty and clarity for all. The working group recommendations for a “clearer decision-making framework” and “strategic solutions” reflect this.\nThe National Planning Policy Framework is clear that great weight should be given to conserving and enhancing the landscape and scenic beauty in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Specific strong protections are enshrined for protected areas or assets of particular importance within the framework, including Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Green Belt, irreplaceable habitats, and designated heritage assets.\nUnder proposed changes to the planning system, the process used to assess the potential environmental effects of relevant plans and major projects will be improved through a requirement to prepare Environmental Outcome Reports. This will put protecting our environment and pursuing environmental improvements at the forefront of assessments. This is in addition to changes to the National Planning Policy Framework, which has been updated with a new expectation that all new streets are tree-lined, alongside measures to improve biodiversity and access to nature through design.\nYou may also be interested to know that the Environment Act introduces mandatory net gain for biodiversity into the planning system. This will ensure that new houses are not built at the expense of nature and deliver thriving natural spaces for our communities. Planning for nature recovery will also be improved through Local Nature Recovery Strategies, while Nature Recovery Networks will be established to join up nature sites and create wildlife-rich places.\nEnvironmental Land Management Scheme\nAs part of the Agricultural Transition Plan, I am aware that the Government is introducing three agricultural schemes to replace the arbitrary land-based subsidies we retained from the EU. Instead, the Government is introducing policies that work for farm businesses, food production and the environment, including the Sustainable Farming Incentive, Local Nature Recovery and Landscape Recovery. I understand that Ministers aim for at least 70 per cent of farms to participate in these schemes, by making sure that all farm types can access the funding and support that works for them.\nThe Sustainable Farming Incentive will support sustainable approaches to farming that will benefit the environment alongside food production. This year, the initial offer is focused on soils, supporting farmers to build the health and fertility of their soil and reduce soil erosion which is essential for sustainable food production. This will help to bolster food security and the longer-term resilience of the sector. This scheme is now open for applications via the Rural Payments Agency.\nFurther, Local Nature Recovery will pay for locally-targeted actions to make space for nature in the farmed landscape and the wider countryside, alongside food production. I am aware that these could be done, for example, on parts of farms that are not suitable for production, less productive or difficult to work. I understand that this scheme is expected to be rolled out in 2024.\nFinally, the Landscape Recovery scheme will support long-term, significant habitat restoration and land use change which will be essential for the UK’s climate ambitions. The application process for the first round of Landscape Recovery projects launched earlier this year and I understand that there have been positive applications from a range of partnerships, including farmers. There will be more details announced in the coming months.\nBiodiversity\nthe UK is committed to playing a leading role in developing an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.\nAs part of the global biodiversity framework, I know that the UK will be advocating for ambitious global targets to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. This includes targets to ensure at least 30 per cent of the global land and the ocean is protected, ecosystems are restored, species population sizes are recovering, and extinctions are halted by 2050.\nFurther, the UK’s Presidency of the United Nations Climate Summit (the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) placed nature at the heart of COP26. I know that the Government’s priority is to continue to ensure there is global recognition that biodiversity loss and climate change are inextricably linked, and that action on nature is vital for achieving the Paris goals. I am proud of the leadership shown by the UK in bringing parties together and building consensus through partnerships such as the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, which has now been endorsed by more than 90 political leaders. At the G7 Summit in 2021, Leaders agreed on the Nature Compact, setting out commitments to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.\nDomestically, the Environment Act 2021 sets a new, historic legally binding target to halt the decline in species abundance by 2030. This is a core part of the Ministers’ commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we found it and is supported by the powerful package of new policies and tools in the Act. Biodiversity net gain, Local Nature Recovery Strategies and a strengthened biodiversity duty on public authorities will work together to drive action, to create or restore rich habitats that enable wildlife to recover and thrive, while conservation covenants will help secure habitat for the long term.\nFinally, the Government is investing over £750 million in the Nature for Climate Fund and is expanding on the 364,000 football pitches of priority habitat which has been created or restored since 2010 through the establishment of the Nature Recovery Network. This is all part of the programme of work to deliver our international commitments domestically under the 25-Year Environment Plan.",

They offer care and support for babies, children and young people who are living with complex or incurable conditions.\nTheir services include ‘Day Stay’ sessions for respite care, free accommodation for family members, emergency stays when something unexpected happens, specialist care for young people approaching the end of their life and bereavement counselling. They also have landscaped gardens with sensory areas, wheelchair-accessible swings, adaptable play equipment, a multi-sensory room, a ball pool and messy play areas.\nIt now costs more than £4.3 million each year to provide care and support through Little Havens in the hospice and community team and the organisation must raise over £200,000 per week to make sure they can be there for the families that need them in their hardest times.\nDame Rebecca is co-sponsoring the Gambling Act 2005 (Monetary Limits for Lotteries) Bill in Parliament seeking to remove outdated caps on charity lottery fundraising. Under the current legislation, each charity lottery is capped at selling £50 million worth of tickets each year - a huge limit on their ability to maximise funds for good causes. These sales caps simply restrict the amount and flexibility of charitable funds such lotteries generate for good causes across the country, affecting organisations such as Little Havens which does such important work.\nFollowing her visit, Dame Rebecca said: “I am proud to represent Little Havens, the only children’s hospice in Essex, which hundreds of babies, children and young people across the county rely on during the most challenging moments. During my visit, I saw first-hand the incredible personalised care that is given to these families when faced with the unimaginable news that there is no cure for their child’s illness.\nI am also supporting calls for a more sustainable funding model for children’s hospices so they can continue caring for seriously ill children, providing the support that so many families depend on.”\nFor further information visit their website here: www.havenshospices.org.uk/childrens-and-young-peoples-care/ and referrals can be made by telephone on 01702 220350, 24 hours a day.",

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_personal-independent-payments-pip/content_52.html": "I have received several emails from residents about the Government's 'Modernising Support' Green Paper about Personal Independence Payments (PIP).\nFirst, I would like to reassure you that no changes to PIP benefits are currently planned to take place. This is simply a Government consultation on this important issue through the ‘Modernising Support’ Green Paper - which centres on targeting and improving the support for those who need it most. This Green Paper has been published to ensure everyone has a chance to shape welfare reforms that will modernise the support provided through the benefit system and Ministers will respond to the findings in due course. This is an open consultation that is due to close on 22nd July 2024 and you can have your say here: www.gov.uk/government/consultations/modernising-support-for-independent-living-the-health-and-disability-green-paper\nIt has been more than a decade since the introduction of PIP, with the intention that it would provide better targeted support to help disabled people with the extra costs arising from their disability. However, disability and ill health in Britain has changed profoundly since. With almost a quarter of the adult population reporting a disability in 2024, I agree with Ministers that now is the time to look again at how the benefit system can best support people to live full and independent lives.\nOver the coming 5 years, PIP spending is expected to grow by 63% and there are now over 33,000 new awards for PIP per month - compared to 17,000 before the pandemic. With 2.6 million working aged people in receipt of PIP and Disability Living Allowance, we need to better understand how people are using these payments and whether more can be done to help those most in need to live full and independent lives. That is the purpose of this consultation to look at how the system is currently performing and how it could be made better. Again, I want to reassure you that no decisions will be made until this work has been completed.\nOf course, this Government has introduced a series of reforms that have brought greater fairness to the welfare system whilst supporting the most vulnerable. We have introduced Universal Credit, a new modern benefit that ensures people are better off in work than on benefits. Ministers have also announced a £2.5 billion Back to Work Plan, radically expanding the employment support available to help more disabled people and people with health conditions to start, stay and succeed in work. The Work Capability Assessment is also being reformed to better reflect the modern world of work, with the Office for Budget Responsibility confirming that this will reduce the number of people assessed as not needing to prepare for work by 424,000 by 2028-29.\nOn top of this, following the pandemic and the effects of Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine, the Government has provided unprecedented help for the most vulnerable in our society with £104 billion in cost-of-living support from 2022-25, one of the largest packages in Europe, which has prevented 1.3 million people from falling into absolute poverty. This included a Disability Cost of Living Payments of £150 in 2022 and 2023. The Energy Price Guarantee saw the Government capped and paid half of people’s energy bills when prices were at their highest. In April, we increased benefits by a further 6.7% and we have raised the Local Housing Allowance, benefitting 1.6 million households by around £800 this year on average.\nI hope you have found this response reassuring.",

Mrs Harris secured the commitment from Mr Lindsay McGibbon, a Managing Director of the construction firm, after requesting he attended a meeting with her in the House of Commons, so she could raise motorists’ frustrations with the ongoing works.\nThe current lane closures are in place to allow Balfour Beatty to run tests on bridge bearings on the two bridges at the junction. Balfour Beatty anticipates a further lane closure in the new year to carry out any necessary remedial works as a result of those tests. Once completed, this should finally be the end of the series of works that have taken over seven years to complete.\nSpeaking at the meeting Rebecca said:\n“The Sadlers Farm road works have turned into a never-ending story and residents have had enough. Up until now, Balfour Beatty has overrun on almost every project timetable they set out and that is completely unacceptable. Thousands of hours of Castle Point residents’ lives have been wasted stuck in traffic, hours they could have spent at work or home with their families.\n“I am however very grateful that Sadlers Farm has been receiving attention at the top of the business and to have received commitments in person from a Managing Director of the firm. I am pleased that the current lane closures are due to be removed by the end of the month and I will be watching to ensure they keep that commitment. Although I am disappointed they tell me there is likely to be one more period of lane closures necessary next year to complete their work, they are required by Essex Highways to complete it to such a standard that further structural works should not need to take place for decades.”\nBalfour Beatty has also pledged to keep residents far more informed about their remaining work and its timetable for completion.\nSpeaking after the meeting with Rebecca in the House of Commons, Mr McGibbon said:\n“As we enter the final phase of the A13/A130 Sadlers Farm Junction scheme, I was pleased to meet with Rebecca Harris MP today to discuss the progress we have made and some of the challenges we have faced.\n“We have offered our apologies for the inconvenience caused by the ongoing works and remain steadfast in our commitment to completing this programme of remedial works as soon as possible, at no additional cost to the taxpayer. We truly understand the inconvenience that these essential works have caused and I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank the public and the local community for their ongoing patience.”\nSouth Benfleet Essex County Councillor Andrew Sheldon, who was also at the meeting, said:\n“I am very grateful to Rebecca for arranging this meeting and to Balfour Beatty for sending a Managing Director to attend, as really enough is enough. Balfour Beatty has to stick to these pledges. I am sick of missed deadlines and residents are sick of sitting in traffic, seeing rows of cones out of their car window and not a worker in sight.”",

I regularly meet with local Head Teachers in Castle Point and I have lobbied the Government to increase funding for our local schools. I will work to ensure that funding for our local schools continues to grow, and our young people benefit from the best possible start in life.\nSCHOOL FUNDING & SCHOOL STANDARDS\nIn autumn 2022, the Government announced that in 2023-24, schools will get an extra £2 billion of revenue funding and the same again in 2024-25. In July 2023, further funding was also given for the next two academic years to support teachers' pay award - with over £480 million going into schools this academic year and over £825 million for the next. This is on top of the £1.5 billion increase schools were already set to receive in 2023-24, bringing the overall funding increase this year to £3.9 billion, compared to 2022-23.\nThe Government has also rightly increased the higher needs budget. In the coming financial year it will be £10.5 billion, which is 60% higher than it was in 2019-20. Not many budgets, under any Government or in any area, have increased by 60%, which shows the Government’s support for and commitment to fixing this problem. The higher needs budget is a term used to refer to funding provided to support students and young people with a special educational needs and disabilities. Which is part of this Government commitment to support young people who face specific learning challenges.\nIt means that total school revenue funding in England is £57.7 billion for 2023-24, rising to £59.6 billion for 2024-25. As a result, in 2024-25 schools will receive the highest ever in real terms per pupil.\nSchool standards are rising across the board and England has catapulted up the international rankings for academic attainment through our multimillion-pound maths and English hubs programme and phonics screening check. Thanks to reforms introduced since 2010, England is now one of the top performing countries in the world for maths, reading and science. This has delivered 90% of schools to be rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, up from just 68% in 2010.\nTEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION\nSchools in England now have more teachers than ever before, as new data reveals there are over 468,000 teachers in the workforce which means there are over 27,000 more teachers in classrooms since 2010 and 2,800 more than last year. Support staff numbers have continued to grow and at over 281,000, there are now a record number of teaching assistants, ensuring pupils get the support they need to help them learn.\nEarlier this year, the Government delivered on the manifesto commitment to give every new teacher a starting salary of at least £30,000 alongside the highest pay award for teachers in over 30 years. In the recent pay award, teachers and leaders in maintained schools received a pay award of 6.5%, the highest pay award for teachers in over thirty years. Standards of education have risen sharply since 2010, with 89% of school rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, up from just 68% in 2010.\nThis includes increased bursaries worth up to £28,000 tax free and scholarships worth up to £30,000 tax free, to encourage people to teach key subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and computing. The Government has also introduced Levelling Up Premium worth up to £3,000 tax free for these subjects in the first five years of their careers who choose to work in disadvantaged schools. For 2024/25 and 2025/26, the Government is doubling these rates to £6,000 tax free.\nThe Workload Reduction Taskforce was launched by the Secretary of State alongside the pay award in July 2023 and has agreed early recommendations to help reduce teacher workload and encourage education staff wellbeing shrinking their working week by 5 hours within the next 3 years.\nTHE ADVANCED BRITISH STANDARD\nThe Prime Minister has announced plans to develop a new qualification framework called the Advanced British Standard for 16 to 18-year-olds which will bring together the best of A levels and T levels into a single qualification. This will ensure technical and academic education are placed on an equal footing, with every student also studying some form of maths and English to age 18. Students will typically study a minimum of five subjects.\nStudents will also spend more time in the classroom, increasing taught hours to a minimum of 1,475 hours over two years. This is almost 200 more taught hours than a typical A level student in England.\nIt will take around a decade to fully roll out the Advanced British Standard and the Government is consulting on how best to design and implement this new qualification.\nIN CASTLE POINT\nI have worked hard to support local schools and colleges since 2010. I will continue my push to secure more good quality education and training in Castle Point and ensure our young people have bright prospects ahead.\nSince 2010 over 5.7 million people have started their apprenticeship journey and the government is increase investment in apprenticeships to £2.7 billion by 2024 to 2025, ensuring businesses have a pipeline of talent to grow the economy. Last year in Castle Point 550 new apprenticeships were started.\nI was recently toured around the state-of-the-art XTEND digital campus on Canvey with the Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Robert Halfon, which focuses on augmented reality, virtual reality, extended reality and immersive education. I also welcomed £4 million of funding from the Government for Cedar Hall School which allowed them to build new state-of-the-art classrooms and facilities, all completed in time for the new academic year.",

We will be led by the evidence on whether this form of exploration can be done in a way which acceptably manages the risk to local communities.\nIn the November 2019 manifesto, the Government confirmed a moratorium on shale gas exploration in England with immediate effect. Having listened to local communities and assessed the state of the science we ruled out changes to the planning system. As set out in the manifesto, we will not support shale extraction unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.\nIn line with the British Geological Survey report on the scientific advances in hydraulic fracturing since 2019, forecasting the occurrence of large earthquakes and their expected magnitude owing to shale gas extraction remains a challenge with significant uncertainty.\nThe Government is confirming today that we will again take a presumption against issuing any further hydraulic fracturing consents. This position, an effective moratorium, will be maintained until compelling new evidence is provided which addresses the concerns around the prediction and management of induced seismicity. This is in line with the commitment made in the 2019 Conservative Manifesto.\nWhile future applications for hydraulic fracturing consent will be considered on their own merits by the Secretary of State, in accordance with the law, shale gas developers should take the Government’s position into account when considering new developments.\nNovember 2019: Government ends support for fracking in England on the basis of new scientific analysis\n- Oil and Gas Authority report published today concludes that it is not possible with current technology to accurately predict the probability of tremors associated with fracking\n- Separate proposals to change the planning process for fracking sites will no longer be taken forward at this time\nFracking will not be allowed to proceed in England, the government has announced today, following the publication of new scientific analysis.\nMinisters took the decision on the basis of a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), which found that it is not currently possible to accurately predict the probability or magnitude of earthquakes linked to fracking operations.\nFracking already takes place across the world including in the US, Canada and Argentina. However, exploratory work to determine whether shale could be a new domestic energy source, delivering benefits for our economy and energy security, has now been paused - unless and until further evidence is provided that it can be carried out safely here.\nMinisters have always been clear that the exploration of England’s shale gas reserves could only proceed if the science shows that it is safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby. For that reason, government introduced tight planning controls through the Infrastructure Act 2015 and set strict limits on seismicity, in consultation with industry.\nOn the basis of the disturbance caused to residents living near Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road site in Lancashire and this latest scientific analysis, the government has announced a moratorium on fracking until compelling new evidence is provided.\nThe government also confirmed today that it will not be taking forward proposed planning reforms for shale gas developments at this time. These proposals were consulted on in 2018 but will not be implemented now.\nBusiness and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom said:\nWhilst acknowledging the huge potential of UK shale gas to provide a bridge to a zero carbon future, I’ve also always been clear that shale gas exploration must be carried out safely. In the UK, we have been led by the best available scientific evidence, and closely regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority, one of the best regulators in the world.\nAfter reviewing the OGA’s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community.\nFor this reason, I have concluded that we should put a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect.\nOther sources of natural gas will continue to contribute to the UK’s diverse energy mix. The Committee on Climate Change has previously said that there will still be a requirement for natural gas in a 2050 net zero economy.\nMaintaining diverse gas supplies, for use during the transition as the UK renewable sector grows – or for the production of hydrogen – remains a priority for this government.\nBusiness, Energy and Clean Growth Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said:\nThe Committee on Climate Change’s advice is clear that natural gas will continue to have a key role to play as we eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050, including for the production of hydrogen. However, following our action today, that gas will need to come from sources other than domestic fracking.\nToday’s decision will not in any way impact our energy supply. The UK benefits from one of the most active gas markets in the world, with security ensured through diverse sources - including domestic offshore production, pipelines from Europe and liquid natural gas terminals.\nThe Traffic Light System was introduced in 2012 as an evidence-based method of regulating seismicity caused by shale gas exploration. It has operated at Preston New Road, allowing the OGA to swiftly put a halt to activity when required – including after several significant events this summer.\nOil and Gas Authority Director of Regulation Tom Wheeler said:\nSince the OGA suspended hydraulic fracturing at Preston New Road we have been considering whether the operator’s plans are still appropriate to manage the risk of induced seismicity. The OGA’s considerations have been informed both by the seismic events and by independent scientific analysis of data from the first Preston New Road well.\nBased on these, the OGA believes that further detailed geomechanical analysis would be needed before we could evaluate with confidence whether hydraulic fracturing could resume in the Fylde, or elsewhere, consistent with the government’s policy aims.",

  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_new-draft-local-plan-2023-2043/content_60.html": "I have submitted my views on the local plan options consultation online. My full submission is at the bottom of this page.\nIf you have not already taken part in Castle Point Council's consultation - please do! It is important they hear your views.\nMy Main Points are as follows:\n- A large number of the brownfield sites identified as options for development are parts of key community infrastructure and should be removed as options at the earliest possible opportunity. These include a fire station, a police station, several supermarkets, large council owned town centre car parks, churches, two community halls, three libraries, health centres in Benfleet, Thundersley and Canvey and USP (formerly SEEVIC) College. Under no circumstances should these key pieces of community infrastructure be demolished in favour of residential development and I am frankly baffled at their inclusion in this consultation.\n- The Council should look to preserve the Green Belt sites on the urban periphery of our Borough that local residents clearly attach a great deal of value to. The protection of fields in the Green Belt used for farming and grazing should be a priority of the plan. I am pleased that the Council is looking to preference brownfield land for development. However, if the Labour Government effectively force you to allocate Green Belt for development, the ONLY site in Castle Point that should be considered for residential development by the Council is what is listed in the plan as the North West Thundersley site. This site is shielded from the rest of the Borough by Woodside Hill encompassing Woodside Park, which should be retained in its entirety and enhanced. Various capacity studies in the past have identified the site as suitable for several thousand units of the Borough’s housing need, and its density could be intensified to ensure other Green Belt sites are protected. Its realisation would affect existing residents far less than any other Green Belt site on the urban periphery of our Borough. As it is mainly plotlands, light industry and sites that cannot be accessed or viewed by residents, its utility as Green Belt is minimal especially when compared to other Green Belt sites listed as options in this consultation. However, if it is to be included into the plan, the Council should absolutely guarantee that a much needed extra road access into and out of the Borough and onto the wider road network via the A127 or the A1295 should be included. The Council should also examine the viability of moving Manor Road Trading estate to the area instead and redesignating the area for residential development. This would remove the problem of lorries heading to and from the estate having to traverse local residential roads.\n- I am also very concerned that the Council are asking residents whether they support development on a large number of both brownfield and Green Belt sites before their ‘deliverability’ has been established, or even before the Council have asked if the owners are willing to actually build homes on their site. The deliverability of all sites will have to be determined before Councillors are presented with options for site selection, but I believe the deliverability, or at least the availability, of sites should have been determined before the public consultation. Residents will feel deceived if they take the time and effort to either support or oppose the inclusion of specific sites local to them for development in the plan if those sites never had a prospect of being delivered in the first place. It also opens up the Council to the very serious risk that Councillors may include brownfield sites that are not deliverable into their site selections in an attempt to preserve Green Belt sites and reflect residents’ wishes, only to have their selections challenged at examination by developers looking to include their Green Belt sites for development instead. Undeliverable sites should be removed from consideration as soon as possible.\nI am further concerned about this following the announcement by the new Deputy Prime Minister, that Castle Point is likely to face a housing target that would mean an extra 6000+ units built in our Borough. The Government may well look at the options presented in this document and believe that together they represent the true capacity of Castle Point for development, when it is in reality far from the case, many of these sites are undeliverable and our local infrastructure would be stretched beyond breaking point.\n- Brownfield development around our town centres should be supported as one of the main solutions for our local housing need that would also support our town centre businesses by growing the market on their doorstep. This however should not come at the expense of commercial land and employment sites and not at a density level that would put intolerable strain on local infrastructure. Some floors of flats above a ground floor reserved for commercial and employment activity should be the preferred solution for such sites as long as adequate and realistic parking can also be provided for the development.\n- The Council should submit a fifteen-year plan for development rather than a twenty-year plan. There is no legal requirement for the Council to submit a twenty-year plan and by adding five years to the length of the plan, it means that the Council have to accommodate five more years of housing need in their plan. In December last year you as the Council conducted your own local housing need study, as was permitted under the previous Government, which came up with a need of 255 homes a year. By adding another 5 years to the plan, you are having to find sites for 1275 extra homes that are not necessary. The Council should reduce the length of the plan to 15 years and plan for 1275 fewer homes.\n- I am personally very dismayed that the Council failed to use the lower assessed housing need figure they contained in the local housing need report they released in December 2023 to defend against recent speculative planning applications and appeals on Green Belt. It would have seriously strengthened their case. I understand the Council does not want to run the risk of the report being legally challenged before the local plan examination, but by then there may well be very little Green Belt left worth defending if developers keep exploiting this legal weakness.\n- Flooding needs to be a key concern of this local plan. Localised flooding is a key concern of many residents, particularly on Canvey, and special attention should be given to localised flood prevention measures and the capacity of the existing drainage system to take further runoff from development. Similarly, the Council has made no reference to any outcomes of the Section 19 Flood Report released in 2022 regarding the flooding of dozens of homes across Castle Point in Autumn 2021.\n- I am pleased that there are references to an additional road access for Canvey Island in the issues and options document. However, the Council should start actively seeking it now. The Council should immediately reinstate work on the Canvey West Access Taskforce that has been dormant for two and a half years, bring all the parties together and start planning now. I have always been willing to take funding requests to the Government but as of now the Council have not produced a single piece of paper for a proposal.\nTake part yourself\nCastle Point Borough Council has set up a number of face-to-face events to answer residents’ questions and record their views on the Local Plan issues and options document they have published. This includes options for future development sites across the whole of Castle Point!\nI know residents have strong feelings about possible development options in their area and it’s important everyone engages with the consultation events. This is after all about the future of the Borough!\nPlease do make it to one of Castle Point Borough Council’s local plan consultation events below if you can.\nCanvey:\n- 16th Aug 2024 - 19:00 to 20:30 - St Nicholas Church Hall\n- 21st Aug 2024 - 14:00 to 15:30 - St Nicholas Church Hall\nDaws Heath:\n- 9th Aug 2024 - 19:00 to 20:30- Daws Heath Social Hall\n- 5th September 2024 - 14:00 to 15:30 - Daws Heath Social Hall\nHadleigh:\n- 22nd Aug 2024 - 19:00 to 20:30- Hadleigh Baptist Church\nBenfleet:\n- 7th Aug 2024 - 19:00 to 20:30 - Richmond Hall\n- 14th Aug 2024 - 19:00 to 20:30 - Richmond Hall\nThundersley:\n- 6th Aug 2024 - 19:00 to 20:30 - St George’s Hall\n- 13th Aug 2024 - 14:00 to 15:30 - Castle Point Borough Council Offices\n- 15th Aug 2024 - 14:00 to 15:30 - Castle Point Borough Council Offices\n- 20th Aug 2024 - 14:00 to 15:30 - Runnymede Hall (behind the Castle Point Borough Council Offices)\n- 4th September 2024 - 19:00 to 20:30 - Runnymede Hall (behind the Castle Point Borough Council Offices)\nA number of residents have raised concerns with me about the lack of consultation events on the eastern half of Canvey Island and in the eastern half of Hadleigh. I am writing to the Council and asking them to set up more events in those areas so face-to-face consultation is as accessible as possible to all local residents.\nOnline consultation events will also be available and I understand further details will be published by the Council in due course.\nYou can submit your views on the local plan options consultation online. You don't have to answer every single question.\nRebecca Harris' Answers to questions on local plan issues and options document:\nQ1. What are your views on the draft Vision for the Castle Point Plan?\nI think the vision is good, but there should also be a commitment to the preservation of the semi-rural character of the Borough through the protection of the Green Belt treasured by local residents adjacent to the urban periphery. I am pleased to see mitigation of climate change and its effects in the vision, but I think it needs to be much more explicit about protecting residents from the dangers of flooding. There should also be greater emphasis on the provision of improved local infrastructure.\nQ2. What are your views on the issues that need to be addressed on Canvey Island within the Castle Point Plan?\nA lack of infrastructure, specifically a third road access for the island. I am pleased to see this recognised in the document but the Council should commit to recommencing work on the Canvey West Access Task Force to maximise the chances that an access is actually delivered in the plan period. The protection of residential properties and businesses from flooding should also be a key issue, as should the mitigation of the two top-tier COMAH sites on the island and the preservation of the local environment. The plan should not attempt to increase the residential density of the island without improvements to local infrastructure.\nQ3. Do you have any comments on how we should improve access to and through Canvey?\nI am pleased a potential third road access is listed in the local plan options document. I am however disappointed to see potential problems with it listed before a formal scoping has been done. The Council should recommence work on the Canvey West Access Task Force immediately and pursue a third road access for the island as the most important transport priority for the Borough. The fact work on the Canvey Third Access Taskforce that myself and many other residents campaigned so hard for, has been abandoned by the Council since 2022 is inexcusable. It has unnecessarily set back the timeframe for achieving a third road access by years. All the other minor potential transport improvements listed would be beneficial and should also be explored.\nQ4. What changes or improvements would you like to see in Canvey Town Centre?\nIt needs to be more welcoming and become more of a destination for retail and experience-based economic activity like meals out and socialising with friends and family. More events would be beneficial as would an expansion of the market and improved parking. Ideally free parking for at least three hours to support local traders and increase footfall in the Council’s own shopping centre. I would also like to see the loading bay area improved as it is an unsightly ‘Welcome to Canvey’ when approached from Elder Tree Road.\nQ5. What type of development would you support within the Canvey Town Centre East development cluster?\n&\nQ6. What type of development would you support within the Canvey Town Centre West development cluster?\n&\nQ7. What type of development would you support within the Long Rd development cluster?\n&\nQ8. What types of development could be considered as appropriate within the South & East parts of Canvey Island?\n&\nQ13. Do you have any views about the potential Site Allocations in Canvey?\nThe Council should prioritise protecting the Green Belt. Please see the attached list of brownfield sites I think could be suitably redeveloped. Please take the notes attached to each individual site into account regarding the type and density of development I believe would be appropriate.\nQ9. What improvements to the Seafront Entertainment Area would you like to see?\nImproved access and improvements to the visual environment. I would support whatever practical improvements local business owners would suggest as they know what would improve the experience for their customer base better than anyone else. Whatever improvements are implemented however, they should also have the support of local residents who live in or nearby the area.\nQ10. Do you have any comments on Canvey’s port infrastructure?\nUltimately the two top tier COMAH sites located on the Port of London Authority land should be relocated. Until then the Council should do all they can to ensure the safety and security of the sites is maintained and the local environment is protected for the benefit of residents.\nQ11. What improvements should be made to the South & West Canvey Wildlife Corridor?\nImprovements that increase the biodiversity of the corridor and that improve access for local residents for recreational and educational purposes. Any improvements or changes to the condition of the landscape however should fully take into account any implications they may have for flood risk in the area.\nQ12. What approach to development in the West Canvey Employment Area (Charfleets Industrial Estate and the Canvey Retail Park) would you support?\nAn approach that leads to more well-paid jobs on the island and that local residents fully support.\nQ14. What are your views on the issues that need to be addressed in Benfleet within the Castle Point Plan?\nStretched local transport and roads infrastructure, the need to improve the local town centres as a destination for local retail and experience based commerce like eating out and socialising. Local green spaces should also be preserved and enhanced where possible. Flooding issues around the council-owned South Benfleet playing fields, and others identified to properties in the Section 19 report on the floods that took place in the Autumn of 2021. The Benfleet conservation area should also be improved and enhanced.\nQ15. What changes or improvements would you like to see in South Benfleet Local Centre?\nI think the environment of the town centre needs to be improved and made more inviting to ensure it is an attractive destination for local residents and for potential customers travelling through it.\nQ16. What type of development would you support within the South Benfleet development cluster?\n&\nQ17. What type of development would you support within the Benfleet Station development cluster?\n&\nQ18. What approach should be taken to development in and around the South Benfleet Conservation Area?\nPlease see the attached list of brownfield sites I think could be suitably redeveloped. Please take the notes attached to each individual site into account regarding the type and density of development I believe would be appropriate.\nQ19. What changes or improvements would you like to see in Tarpots Local Centre?\nI think parking needs to be improved there as the bays actually along the south side of the Tarpots parade are too small. I would like to see general improvements to the environment in the area to improve its attractiveness as a local destination for convenience shopping and experience based commerce like eating out and socialising. Parking should be improved in general for the benefit of existing businesses and customers.\nQ20. What type of development would you support within the Tarpots development cluster?\nPlease see the attached list of brownfield sites I think could be suitably redeveloped. Please take the notes attached to each individual site into account regarding the type and density of development I believe would be appropriate.\nQ21. What types of development could be considered as appropriate within the Manor Trading Estate?\nUltimately I believe the Manor Trading Estate should be relocated and the land should be redesignated for residential use. This would take many lorries and other heavy goods vehicles off residential roads in that part of Thundersley. However, if this is deemed unviable then development for employment uses that facilitate the creation of well-paid jobs and do not see an inappropriate increase in heavy goods traffic in the area should be encouraged. Ideally I would like to see a new road put in to the north of the trading estate connecting it to the A127 or the Rayleigh Spur roundabout.\nQ23. What improvements should be made to the South Benfleet Playing Fields area?\nAnything that improves the environment or the utility of the park for local residents should be considered. The capacity and function of the playing fields as a flood water storage area should be improved and improvements that deal with persistent flooding issues around the north east of the park should be prioritised. The building in the park accessed via Brook Road that houses changing rooms, kitchens and a small seating area is a grossly underused community asset that could be used by far more local groups and for a range of purposes.\nQ24. Do you have any views about the potential Site Allocations in Benfleet?\nThe Council should prioritise protecting the Green Belt. Please see the attached list of brownfield sites I think could be suitably redeveloped. Please take the notes attached to each individual site into account regarding the type and density of development I believe would be appropriate.\nQ26. How should the management of Benfleet and Southend Marshes be approached in the Plan?\nExpert advice should be sought on the matter with the aim of preserving and promoting local wildlife and the natural environment, whilst also maintaining any and all functions relating to the mitigation of local flood risk. Although part of the area is marked as Green Belt, as it is marshland inaccessible for many months of the year it should not be considered in calculations to determine the percentage of available Green Belt across the whole Borough allocated for development in each option of the plan.\nQ27. What improvements should be made to the Hadleigh Castle Country Park area?\nImprovements that enhance access and enjoyment for family-based outdoor recreation. This includes promoting learning about the unique history and environmental benefit of the area whilst preserving the local historical heritage of the area. I do not believe any of the farmland in the area should be considered for residential development.\nQ28. What changes or improvements would you like to see in Hadleigh Town Centre?\nI think the environment of the town centre needs to be improved and made more inviting to ensure it is an attractive destination for local residents and for potential customers travelling through it. Specifically, the Council should consult with residents and decide the future of the former Crown site in the town centre, and indeed work with residents, businesses and community groups to create and deliver a practical vision for the future of the whole ‘island site’ in the town centre.\nQ29. What type of development would you support within the Hadleigh Central development cluster?\n&\nQ30. What type of development would you support within the Vic House Corner Roundabout development cluster?\n&\nQ31. What type of development would you support within the Hadleigh East development cluster?\n&\nQ32. What opportunities for improvements and development within the A13 corridor in Hadleigh are there?\n&\nQ33. Do you have any views about the potential Site Allocations in Hadleigh?\nThe Council should prioritise protecting the Green Belt. Please see the attached list of brownfield sites I think could be suitably redeveloped. Please take the notes attached to each individual site into account regarding the type and density of development I believe would be appropriate.\nQ34. What are your views on the issues that need to be addressed in Daws Heath within the Castle Point Plan? The biggest issue in Daws Heath is the inclusion of two Green Belt sites, the site north of Daws Heath Road and South of Daws Heath Road, into the options document identifying them for possible development, when myself and hundreds of residents campaigned hard against development on the sites and the Council just fought and won two appeals against developers over them! These sites should not be developed and when other potential Green Belt sites have been excluded as possible options I am sure many residents are confused and more than a little disheartened to see them being considered as development options.\nQ35. Do you have any views about the potential Site Allocations in Daws Heath?\nPlease see the attached list of brownfield sites I think could be suitably redeveloped. Please take the notes attached to each individual site into account regarding the type and density of development I believe would be appropriate.\nQ36. What are your views on the issues that need to be addressed in Thundersley within the Castle Point Plan?\nThe village feel of the area should be promoted and the town centre should be enhanced. The dire traffic issues along the Rayleigh Road around The Woodmans Arms and up to Rayleigh Weir needs to be addressed and the Common and surrounding area should be protected as a recreation space with immense utility for local residents.\nQ37. What type of development would you support within the Kiln Rd development cluster?\n&\nQ38. What opportunities for improvements and development within the A13 corridor in Thundersley are there?\n&\nQ40. Do you have any views about the potential Site Allocations in Thundersley?\nThe Council should prioritise protecting the Green Belt. Please see the attached list of brownfield sites I think could be suitably redeveloped. Please take the notes attached to each individual site into account regarding the type and density of development I believe would be appropriate.\nQ41. What do you think the Castle Point Plan housing requirement need figure should be? Please select your preferred choice from the options below:\nOther: 15 years rather than 20 years of the annual local housing need. Castle Point Borough Council does not need to submit a local plan that accommodates 20 years worth of development when the Government only mandates local authorities to find sites for 15 years worth of housing need.\nI am personally very dismayed that the Council failed to use the lower assessed housing need figure they contained in the local housing need report they released in December 2023 to defend against recent speculative planning applications and appeals on Green Belt. It would have seriously strengthened their case. I understand the Council does not want to run the risk of the report being legally challenged before the local plan examination, but by then there may well be very little Green Belt left worth defending if developers keep exploiting this legal weakness.\nQ42. Please rank the following options in your order of preference for delivering the housing growth we need:\n&\nQ43. Do you have any comments on the implications of the Options (for development) opposite?\n&\nQ44. Do you have another preferred option, which may include a combination of the above, or alternative land sources?\n&\nQ46. What types of development could be considered as appropriate within the North West of Thundersley area?\nI have issues with all of these options and indeed the level of need currently planned for that necessitates them as per my answer to the previous question. That notwithstanding, I would prefer the Council keep development within the existing urban area. However as previously mentioned, if the new Labour Government effectively force the Council to consider Green Belt for development, either allocating the area NW of Thundersley for residential development, or moving Manor Trading estate there and redeveloping that for residential use, should be the only Green Belt option considered. Even then, it would have to come with a new road access onto the A127 or Rayleigh Spur roundabout/ Fairglen interchange to improve the borough’s access to the wider road network and not add further pressure to the already congested Rayleigh Weir and Sadlers Farm junctions.\nI believe the potential housing capacity of that site is higher than indicated by the Council and believe it is indicated as such by other previous studies into the site. If as stated the Government do in effect force the Council to allocate the site for housing, then its housing density should be increased as necessary to meet all remaining need and ensure other Green Belt around the Borough that local residents cherish are protected.\nQ45. What do you think about the sources of urban land identified, and how should they be managed if they are redeveloped, for example, should existing service capacity be retained on site or within the borough?\nA large number of the brownfield sites identified as options for development are parts of key community infrastructure and should be removed as options at the earliest possible opportunity. These include a fire station, a police station, several supermarkets, large council owned town centre car parks, churches, two community halls, three libraries, health centres in Benfleet, Thundersley and Canvey and USP (formerly SEEVIC) College. Under no circumstances should these key pieces of community infrastructure be demolished in favour of residential development and I am frankly baffled at their inclusion in this consultation. The deliverability of all the brownfield sites will have to be determined before Councillors are presented with options for site selection, but I believe the deliverability, or at least the availability, of sites should have been determined before the public consultation. Residents will feel deceived if they take the time and effort to either support or oppose the inclusion of specific sites local to them for development in the plan if those sites never had a prospect of being delivered in the first place. It also opens up the Council to the very serious risk that Councillors may include brownfield sites that are not deliverable into their site selections in an attempt to preserve Green Belt sites and reflect residents’ wishes, only to have their selections challenged at examination by developers looking to include their Green Belt sites for development instead. Undeliverable sites should be removed from consideration as soon as possible.\nQ47. Please rank the following outcome options in your order of preference to show what you feel should be delivered alongside new housing in the Plan:\n&\nQ48. Are there any other priorities not listed above which you feel should be delivered alongside new housing in the plan?\n&\nQ49. What benefits could justify increased density in new development in the borough?\n&\nQ50. Are there any other benefits that you think it would be appropriate for higher density development to deliver?\nI think all the options listed are important and hard for local residents to rank against each other. I think any other priorities or benefits listed by local residents should be given the utmost consideration.\nQ81. Do you have any views on protecting and enhancing the borough’s heritage assets as set out above?\nCompared to most other districts, Castle Point has relatively few heritage assets and historical buildings given its long history of settlement dating back to Saxon times. Protection of what is left of the Borough’s local heritage should be a key part of the local plan proposals. This should include heritage buildings from more recent history, including the Canvey Transport Museum, the Edwardian era façade of Hadleigh Old Fire Station, the façade of the old Canvey Island Urban District Council Offices on Long Road, and the historic farm and accommodation buildings on Hadleigh Farm\nQ90. How do you feel the risk of flooding should be managed in new development?\nI think it is important that any new development should have to prove its resilience to flood risk, but also a thorough assessment of any downstream implications for the capacity of existing flooding infrastructure needs to be undertaken. The true capacity of some local flood risk assets is unknown and many of the assets are insufficiently mapped or not mapped accurately. The true capacity of flood risk assets downstream from all development sites should be fully explored and mapped so that developers, the Council, and local residents, can be absolutely sure that the flood mitigation measures put in place will not strain enough on existing assets to increase flood risk elsewhere.\nQ97. Would you support seeking a higher than 10% Biodiversity Net Gain requirement?\n&\nQ98. Would you support the introduction of an Urban Greening Factor seeking to increase biodiversity in urban areas?\nYes.\nQ110. Which of the following active travel infrastructure improvements would you be in favour of?\nAll of them are important.\nQ112. What type of road infrastructure needs to be improved over the Plan period?\nAll the options listed are important but specific improvements to road access onto Canvey Island should be added as an option as well.\nQ113. Which parts of the highway network should be prioritised for improvement?\n&\nQ114. Are there any new transport routes that you feel should be introduced to provide better/quicker routes to ease congestion?\nThere are currently only three ways into and out of the Borough, via Sadlers Farm, Rayleigh Weir, or East on the A13 and residential roads to Southend. As detailed in previous answers, a third road access for Canvey Island should be the number one transport priority of the plan and the Council should restart work on the Canvey West Access Taskforce immediately. The Council should also seek to secure another access onto the A127 or the Rayleigh Spur roundabout to ease congestion on existing routes.\nQ118. What do you think about the proposed parking standards?\nYou do not describe them in detail in the document so it’s very hard for residents to answer this question! There should always be sufficient off-street parking for each development so local residential roads do not have to take the strain of extra parking from the development.\nQ119. What measures would help to reduce the impacts of rat-running on unsuitable routes in the borough?\nAlthough those options may help, the biggest thing that the new local plan could do to prevent ‘rat running’ on unsuitable roads is plan sensitively to minimise congestion on the main routes that residents attempt to avoid via rat running and actively allocate funds from local development to ensure they are improved.",

Since 2024, following boundary changes, in addition to these areas she also now represents the people of Bowers Gifford in Parliament.\nShe was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 2010 with a majority of 7,600, and was re-elected in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2024 respectively. Rebecca received 76.7% of the vote share in 2019 and boosted her majority to 26,634. Prior to the General Election in May 2015, Rebecca was named as the Member of Parliament with the 4th highest voting record in the country and has maintained one of the highest attendance ratings in Parliament since.\nRebecca has spent the majority of her working life in business, principally with Phillimore & Co who are specialist publishers of local British history and have published titles on Hadleigh, Thundersley, Canvey Island, and Daws Heath. At Phillimore, Rebecca started as a delivery driver and worked her way up through the company until she joined the Board as Marketing Director in 1997, a position she held until the sale of the firm in 2007.\nHaving been an employer, Rebecca believes that now more than ever, the House of Commons needs people with her sort of practical business experience. Through using her negotiation skills, she has achieved a cross party consensus on issues of local importance such as preventing Deans School from closing in 2014 and securing higher levels of Police funding.\nRebecca also has experience of local government having been a councillor for four years. She is strongly committed to \"localism\" believing that turnouts in local elections will be higher, and decisions will be better if local councils exert more power over the decisions that affect their residents. She has built and maintained effective relationships with local councillors, regardless of party affiliation, which facilitates great results for constituents on local issues.\nRebecca has successfully fought to save green belt sites in Castle Point from development.\nBefore being elected to represent Castle Point in 2010, Rebecca was the Political Special Adviser to the Shadow Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry, Health, Education, Transport, and Environment respectively. She also worked as a Caseworker part-time in the House of Commons to get a “solid grounding in the role of an MP, a job for which there isn’t any formal training”.\nRebecca is a keen supporter of small businesses, from her background at Phillimore, and campaigned to make sure the Government was doing all it can to ensure support for small enterprise. One issue in particular that Rebecca campaigned on is Business Rates, and she frequently contributed to enquiries on this matter in her role as a member of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee. Before the Autumn Statements and Budget days in 2013, Rebecca had correspondence with the Chancellor and was pleased to see him cap small business rates to 2% in December of that year.\nRebecca was a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Visteon Pensioners, the co-chair of the APPG for Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency, and the Chair of the APPG for Brain Tumours. Following the tragic story of Danny Green, an 11 year old Canvey resident who died from a brain tumour, Rebecca campaigned for more funding for Brain Tumour Research and was very pleased in 2018 when the Department of Health and Social Care and Cancer Research UK pledged an additional £45 million for the cause.\nAfter being successfully re-elected in 2015, Rebecca was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers and in 2016 was appointed as the PPS to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid.\nIn June 2017, Rebecca was delighted to be appointed to the Government Whips Office. In July 2022, she was appointed as the first ever female Comptroller of HM Household in over 600 years. This is a senior position within the Whips Office responsible for ensuring all Government legislation progresses through Parliament and into law. In addition, Rebecca also served as the Foreign Office Government Whip and the Private Members’ Bills Whip.\nAs a long time Eurosceptic, Rebecca worked hard in the Whips Office to deliver the result of the 2016 Referendum, and represent her constituents of which 72.7 per cent (37,691 people) voted to end the UK’s membership of the EU. Rebecca voted in support of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement at every stage and in favour of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement reached with the EU in 2020. She also voted in favour of the Windsor Framework which replaced the broken Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThrough her role, Rebecca ensured that the policies from the Conservative Party Manifesto were implemented. This included all the Brexit legislation, but also key domestic reforms whether that be the world-leading Environment Act, safer streets through the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, stopping the boats through the Nationality and Borders Act and Illegal Migration Act or support for the cost of living through the Energy Price Guarantee and Cost of Living Payments. Rebecca was also the Whip in charge of the Domestic Abuse Act and was proud to see greater protections for victims become law. She also ensured all the sanctions against Russia for their barbaric illegal invasion of Ukraine have come into force.\nAs Private Members’ Bills Whip, Rebecca was incredibly successful in supporting a record number of backbench MPs bringing forward their proposals to change the law. Some of the most recent legislation includes the Botulinum Toxin and Cosmetic Fillers (Children) Act banning cosmetic procedures for children, the British Sign Language Act to promote the use of BSL and further world-leading animal welfare legislation such the Glue Traps (Offences) Act, Animal (Penalty Notices) Act, Shark Fins Act and Animals (Low Welfare Activities Abroad) Act.\nBy custom, senior Government Whips are also ceremonially appointed to positions within the Royal Household and so she took part in the procession for HM Queen Elizabeth II’s State Funeral and King Charles III’s Coronation, both of which she found a true honour. In addition, she also accompanied The King, The Queen and other members of the Royal Family to certain diplomatic and social events.\nRebecca was awarded Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at the King's Birthday Honours 2024 for Political and Public Service.\nIn July 2024, she served in HM Official Opposition's Whips Office as Deputy Chief Whip. In November 2024, Rebecca was appointed as Opposition Chief Whip.",

Read MORE... https://www.castlepoint.gov.uk/examination-information/\nLocal Plan Hearing Sessions - Matter Seven (Day Three)\nRebecca Harris MP's Submission\nI want to focus my remarks today on three main issues:\n- Firstly, the issue of whether or not Castle Point Council has met the test of exceptional circumstances to justify Green Belt release.\n- Secondly, the evidence base and conclusions contained within the plan relating to the group of sites previously known as the West Thundersley, or ‘Blinking Owl’ site.\n- Thirdly, the highly unique circumstances on Canvey Island and the cumulative effects on development related to it.\nThe plan seeks to place a considerable number of homes in open accessible Green Belt sites - very treasured by the community I represent in Castle Point. Paragraph 137, b) of the NPPF outlines that this can only be justified when increasing the density of residential development sites in town centres has been exhausted as a means of meeting the local objectively assessed housing need.\nLocal policies relating to the density of development should be completely overhauled to accommodate far greater density of development of our local town centres to reduce the number of housing units that the plan includes on local sites in undeveloped green field Green Belt. This has the added benefit, of course, of providing a larger immediately local market for businesses in the town centres.\nDensity needs to be maximized as far as possible on sites in town centres and along main roads and I do not believe sufficient evidence was submitted in the plan to suggest that is the case. Paragraph 9.32 references the Essex Design Guide and ‘The Castle Point Large Site Capacity Assessment 2018’. The document itself is very limited in its scope, talking about mainly the big Green Belt sites in the Borough. It only details one brownfield site adjacent to a town centre, and that is the site that has since been built out along Kent’s Hill Road behind the parade of shops on the North side of the High Road. There is no detailed methodology about how that number was reached, and indeed, no evidence to suggest that the density of the site had been maximised as much as possible to relieve pressure on the Green Belt.\nParagraph 17.10 of the submitted plan makes it clear that the justification for building on Green Belt sites is based on “historic” work on constructing a local plan and previous SHLAAs. The revisions to the NPPF explicitly outlining the threshold of ‘exceptional circumstances’ was only released in late 2018. The Council should provide evidence that the densities based on historic SHLAA reports have been revisited and increased where possible to take the update into account. I do not believe they have done so.\nA number of town centre sites, such as site reference 2013/8 (Hadleigh Island site), in the 2015 SHLAA, appear not to have been updated in subsequent SHLAA updates since 2018 (in fact capacity on that site seems to have decreased by two).\nThe Council must show they have revisited density on brownfield sites in our town centres and increased it as much possible, before they can justify developing on Green Belt. They do not appear to have done so. I believe therefore the plan does not prove the “exceptional circumstances” exist to justify the amount of housing development on Green Belt the plan includes.\nCastle Point Council should undertake a comprehensive review of brownfield sites in the borough’s town centres and along main roads with a view to increasing their density where it is at all appropriate, in order to decrease housing pressure on the Green Belt if they wish to prove exceptional circumstances exist. Because they have not, I do not believe they have met that threshold and therefore a plan that necessitates building on Green Belt sites, especially ones that preserve the open semi-rural nature of the Borough and are treasured by so many residents, cannot be justified.\nGiven that the Council has decided they have exceptional circumstances, and therefore resolved to build on the Green Belt to meet their unmet housing need, it has been of concern to myself, a number of residents, and indeed Councillors, that more emphasis was not put on addressing the deliverability issues regarding the West Thundersley site, as this would actually have something to offer residents in terms of transport improvements and receive broad public support if put forward, instead of the other more open and unspoilt Green Belt sites around the Borough that the community truly value and utilise.\nI believe that the conclusion related to the deliverability of the sites mentioned in the Local Plan Paragraphs 10.5-10.10, relating to ‘Land West of Thundersley’ is not justified. In important instances the conclusions in the evidence base do not seem to accurately reflect some of the evidence presented to support them, or they are based on evidence that makes flawed assumptions. The conclusions about the deliverability of the site also ignore well established means by which the Council could improve the deliverability of a site, or focus on the policies of Essex County Council that can and should be altered to facilitate delivery of the site.\nThe collective site is split up into 25 separate sites listed in the latest SHLAA, but most of it was previously considered as one site, referred to as a previous policy PGB42 / Site H18, as a whole it has been collectively previously been referred to by the Council and residents as the site ‘North West of Thundersley’ and most commonly ‘The Blinking Owl site’. Collectively, according to the SHLAA, the sites have capacity for around 2020 homes.\nThe ‘Regulation 18’ consultation has identified broad support from residents for developing that site, as opposed to other sites in the Green Belt in the urban periphery, and a number of SMEs have expressed interest in developing parts of the site already.\nI believe that reasonable alternatives to the council’s approach in the plan that would improve the deliverability of the Land West of Thundersley are unexplored or ignored and the conclusions relating to the site as a combined entity are not consistent with the evidence presented.\nThe plan states the following about the collective sites, “major barrier to deliverabilty of housing development in this location is twofold:\n- The site is presently significantly constrained by a lack of appropriate access and risks to the strategic network;\n- the land is within multiple ownership with no commitment yet to bring forward a comprehensive development”.\nThe evidence in the SHLAA, relating to the ‘Suitability’ of the collective of sites, concludes that for all of them their suitability is “low - poor accessibility cannot be mitigated”. This conclusion is based on consultation with Essex County Council as part of the ‘Duty to Cooperate’, the key points of which are summarized in ‘Castle Point Transport Evidence Refresh’, specifically Paragraphs 7.3.1 and 7.3.2.\nThe key objection from Essex County Council to the site as the highways authority is that access to the A127 and A130 would be needed to realise the whole collective site for development and that would be contrary to their current policy relating to the A127 and the future strategic improvements to the Fairglen Interchange. The plan, and its supporting documents, show little or no evidence to suggest that efforts to find a highways access solution that would be compatible with Essex County Council’s future plans for the Fairglen interchange have been made. This approach would have been reasonable and may have found a solution to help realise the site, but there is little evidence it was taken.\nI am unaware if you have been presented with the evidence relating to Essex County Council’s short term or long term plan for the Fairglen interchange, but they would appear to only need a small amount of land that could otherwise be used for development. This has not been questioned by Castle Point Council and Essex County Council have not given any reasons as to why it would prejudice the use of the entire site. I have seen no proof that there was an attempt made through the duty-to-cooperate to fully explore how the vast majority of the site could be realised for development, whilst still facilitating the improvements to the interchange.\nSimilarly, there is no evidence presented that Castle Point Council challenged Essex County Council’s access policy, either on the grounds of the large amount of housing that could be realised on the site without putting further strain on Castle Point’s current residential estate highway network, or on the basis that Essex County Council, as a top tier authority, should facilitate the policies of the plan as far as possible, even if it means adapting some of their own policy choices.\nEssex County Council also state that they would object to the development of the combined site without access to the A127/A130, because “access from the existing urban area will exacerbate congestion at Tarpots (A13) and Woodman’s Arms junctions (A129)”. This argument can hardly be unique to this site. This argument would be true of outbound traffic from the majority of development sites in the plan. Indeed, every single large housing development in this current plan would ‘exacerbate congestion’ at the major junctions linked to Tarpots and the Woodman’s Arms, Sadler’s Farm and Rayleigh Weir, why uniquely is there a problem with this site? Essex County Council however do not object to the number of houses in the plan or argue that this should constrain housing development in the plan as a whole. So, this argument does not stack up in my view.\nThis argument also ignores the fact that the large unit capacity at that site would mean considerable financing through a Section 106 agreement and Community Infrastructure Levy for considerable junction improvements at both Tarpots and the Woodman’s Arms. Similarly, Essex County Council also object because strategic access to the site would be required through routes which are currently unmade, when the large amount of housing at the site could more than pay for those roads to be adopted and made up by them as the highways authority via a Section 106 agreement and Community Infrastructure Levy.\nIn fact, most of the problems with the potential minor access options of the combined site listed in the Castle Point: Transport Evidence for the New Local Plan Transport: Phase 2 (CPTE Phase 2), Table 5.1, (specifically references 1-10) could be mitigated via Section 106 and CIL funding.\nEssex County Council also state that works to the Rayleigh Spur roundabout to provide a strategic access would not be economical. I don’t find any evidence submitted with the plan to uphold this assumption. However, even if this is the case, the CPTE Phase 2 report includes consideration of a strategic access via the A130 away from the Rayleigh Weir Spur junction. Incidentally it also would not contravene Essex County Council’s policy of not allowing further or improved access to the A127, and it would also not interfere with any of Essex County Council’s plans for the Fairglen interchange. The CPTE Phase 2 report designates this option with reference 16, and to quote the report directly states that, “In its current form, the access is not suitable to serve developments at the Site H18. It may be possible to provide an enhanced LILO arrangement with dedicated entry and exit lanes, although careful consideration would need to be given to the effects on the roundabout to the north (junction of the A130 with the A1245) and the layby immediately to the south. In addition, traffic arriving at Site H18 from the A130 (south) would need to perform a U-turn at the A130 roundabout junction with the A1245. Similarly, traffic wishing to depart Site H18 at this access to travel northbound would need to first travel south to Sadlers Farm junction and perform a U-turn at that roundabout. If this option were progressed, the impact on those junctions would need to be examined.”\nSo, despite the report clearly indicating that realising this option is a possibility, that would require further research to progress, I cannot find any evidence that this research was undertaken when it would have been reasonable to do so to fully explore the possibility of realising this site.\nThe fact that the above points were not taken into account and no further research was done, means that conclusions of the SHLAA, that suitability of the collective sites known as North West of Thundersley is ‘low and that poor accessibility cannot be mitigated’, cannot be fully justified. This means that the reasonable alternative of including this site in the plan to meet our housing need, in order to remove others, could not have been fully considered.\nThese flawed conclusions in regards to the highways access to the site, also inform conclusions about the ‘achievability’ of delivery of the site in the SHLAA, which states for all of individual sites in the collective that the exceptional costs that damage achievability, are ‘archaeological investigations and public transport accessibility’. The supporting evidence for the local plan does not as far as I can see, include any evidence to back up the claim that archaeological investigation of this site would be more prohibitive than for any of the other large sites included in the plan, and the problems with access to public transport are of course based on the discredited conclusions about highways access to the site I have already mentioned.\nWe are a very constrained Borough in terms of vehicular access and transport. We currently have only really three main access routes out of the Borough for a population of around 91,000 residents; East on the single carriageway A13 to Southend, West on the A13 to Sadler’s Farm junction, and North onto the Rayleigh Weir, all of which are already under immense traffic stress. The North Thundersley site is the only one which could provide an extra exit and access to the whole Borough. Without this site every single vehicle from the 5000 extra homes this plan accounts for, will have to go via those existing main roads and junctions to leave the Borough. This is the only site that would provide infrastructure that could realistically cut congestion in the Borough and I do not therefore believe that to leave possibilities unexplored and highways authority policies unchallenged is acceptable, nor does it mean that discounting this site can be justified.\nIn regards to the other obstacles listed by the local plan to the development of this site, that “the land is within multiple ownership with no commitment yet to bring forward a comprehensive development”, I cannot see evidence that ‘multiple ownership of the site’ is an obstacle backed up by the ‘availability’ report in the SHLAA, as all but one of the individual sites that makes up the wider collection of sites has the same listing, “Landowner responded to Fact Checking 2018 exercise and confirmed the site can be considered as available”. There is in fact only one of the sites where the landowner could not be contacted to verify availability. I do not believe the aforementioned conclusion in the plan about the site reflects this.\nAlthough there are admittedly greater difficulties in realising sites that are in multiple ownership, it is clear that all but one of the landowners is willing to explore further development. In fact, on top of the evidence included on the availability of the site, I know that approximately eight years ago, the vast majority of the landowners of the collective site signed a document at the instigation of a local councillor to say they would be willing to consider selling their land for development.\nI should stress that this councillor had no financial interest of any kind in the matter, but was merely anxious to find alternative site to protect the treasured open Green Belt of his residents living in his ward.\nEven if only one or two landowners could not be contacted to discuss the availability of the land, or attempted to resist perhaps in order to secure unfair land values, the Government have made it clear that they will support the use of compulsory purchase powers by councils to deliver strategic housing sites.\nI have not seen that the Council have evidenced any effort to invite developers to discuss the realisation of this site for development, either individually or via some sort of cooperation vehicle. It is worth noting of course that several major developers have advanced interests in other sites currently included in the plan, so they may have no current incentive to enter into such a vehicle or discussion, or indeed inform the Council it is even a possibility, even if it would be supported by residents.\nAn alternative option to realise the site that the Council have not considered in the slightest however, is to form a ‘development corporation’ themselves to ensure the deliverability of the site – suppose another perfectly possible thing for them to do.\nAgain, by not fully exploring the means to improve the deliverability of the site, the Council cannot claim to have fully explored this as a reasonable alternative to the site allocation policies in their plan. Which means their plan is not fully justified and in my view is therefore unsound.\nThe final point I would like to make about this site is about Green Belt openness. Planner have been contending to myself and to Councillors since 2008 that the level of Green Belt in the Borough is not enough of a constraint to restrict housing development to just brownfield sites. This is despite a colleague of yours, Mr Keith Holland, attending the Council chamber here in Castle Point in September 2014 to address councillors, and planners, and telling the planning officers that the Green Belt was a valid constraint on housing numbers, and indeed myself taking the former chief planning officers and former leaders of this council to meet no less than three separate Planning Ministers to explain the same. The officer advice in Castle Point has none the less remained the same and despite many people being very unhappy at this, councillors have been told that that the development of the Green Belt sites in this current plan is unavoidable. I have gone into detail about why this should not be the case earlier in my submission, but if that is indeed the case now, given how long it has taken for the Council to get a plan together that has a chance of being passed by councillors, then it seems perverse to me that the only site considered for development in the Green Belt that does not impact on the openness and visual amenity of the Green Belt for residents, the only one that does not have mass public opposition from residents, and the one whose inclusion could save the other Green Belt sites in the Borough that residents treasure, and indeed is the only one that could deliver a genuine extra major road access into and out of the Borough, is the only major Green Belt site not included in the plan.\nBut before I conclude my remarks on this topic, I just want to touch on the Council’s response to my written consultation, where I first outlined the concerns I raise today regarding their conclusions about the West Thundersley site, I am unsure whether you have access to them?\nI would be grateful for the Council for its response, however it does not actually address any of the points I made. It states that ‘the evidence is that this site is not deliverable’. However, it fails to address literally any of the concerns I raised about the evidence and the conclusions that the plan reaches based upon them.\nBecause of these reasons I believe the plan has to fully explore every viable option to make it deliverable. The evidence the Council have submitted to support their plan does not consider a number of reasonable and viable options to overcome the issues of access and multiple ownership that stand in the way of North West Thundersley site being delivered and therefore the plan is not justified in its conclusion that this site should not be included at the expense of other large Green field Green Belt sites that our community really treasure.\nFrankly, it has baffled me over the past 13 years that I have been observing this process, that the Council has not made a concerted effort to plan-positively and work with other authorities to overcome the deliverability issues which would lead to a far more sustainable and popular site for residents, which could actually benefit the Borough by providing new access to the wider road network our Borough so sorely needs.\nSo to conclude on this topic, this is a site of huge importance to the plan and local people. It is a site that if it were included in the plan, could accommodate the amount of housing equal to all the other sites in the local Green Belt included in this plan, sites like Jotmans Farm, Dutch Village, Chase, Daws Heath, sites that the development of which local residents definitely do not support and I believe are essential to the semi-rural character of our Borough.\nFinally, I wish to talk about Canvey Island in particular. I will try not go over the very high-quality submissions that already have already been made by concerned residents and I understand that no doubt many communities come before you to resist a large development siting their very ‘unique’ circumstances and arguing they should be a special case. However, I doubt that there are many towns you have come across in the face of your work base the challenge of living many feet below sea level, housing two large top tier COMAH sites so close to their open spaces and homes, whose 40,000 or so residents can only access the mainland via a single junction, namely Waterside Farm roundabout.\nIn 2014 there was a major surface water flooding event on Canvey. The Government’s then Chief Scientific adviser (Sir Mark Walport) came down to do an in-detail report on that flooding at my instigation. Since then I am assured that over £15 million has been spent on improving the drainage and pumping network to hopefully ensure this never happens again, but there is still more work to be done. The cumulative effect of extra housing will put very unnecessary pressure on a complex drainage system that was not designed to support the volume of development it already has. That is a factor that is entirely relevant, but I don’t believe is fully accounted for in planning law or guidance as it stands.\nCanvey is also constrained all around by the Thames and already in desperate need of a third road for its existing population.\nThere are mitigation measures proposed to the issues Canvey faces that are applied to the sites within the plan and in isolation they may well appear to stack up. But because of a highways access issues and the issues surrounding flood risk, they should be considered together. An issue at one end of the island, particularly the western end, effects the whole of the island within minutes.\nWhat I would ask you to consider in regards to Canvey is not the inclusion of the sites on Canvey individually, but to consider them as the whole of the island as being one site.\nWould it be permissible in current planning law and practice guidance to allow the realisation of a site or a single planning application that planned to connect 20,000 households, an industrial estate, two huge commercial areas to the west of the UK road network via a single roundabout junction? I would be very surprised if it would.\nWould it be permissible in current planning law and practice guidance to allow the citing of two large top tier COMAH sites next to each other so close to residential development? I would be surprised if it would.\nWould it be permissible in current planning law and practice guidance to allow the construction of 20,000 households on land via a drainage system as complex as Canvey Island’s? I would be amazed if it would.\nThat will be the cumulative effect on the infrastructure of this plan on Canvey and I would very much urge you to consider the plan in those terms.\nThank you very much for your time today Sir. I will send a written copy of this submission to you now, although I am of course very interested first to hear the responses regarding the points I have raised here from the Council first.\nSo, having made my points, I am very grateful for your indulgence and the time you give me, I’ve tried to be as fast as I could be. I will certainly send you a copy of this shortly, if you would like it and I will of course be very interested to hear any responses regarding the points I have raised here from the Council. Thank you very much.\nFURTHER QUESTIONS...\nLewis Philip (PINS)\nThank you, yes very helpful if you could send a written copy of your statement and that could be then put into the examination library for others to read at their leisure. In terms of some of the points you raised, I'm not really going to respond to them in any great detail at the moment, but what I will say is that I'm examining the plans as before me, I hear what you say about the site North West of Thundersley - that's not in the plan and so I will be considering your comments in the round of sustainability appraisal and the assessments that have gone into the preparation for plan, in terms of legal compliance and soundness. Because the way that the examination works, I have to examine what's before me, what isn't before me, and so that sort of site is generally termed an omissions site and because it's not before me, I can't consider the merits of it. But I can consider how it was taken into account along with all other potential omissions sites by the Council through the preparation for plan and indeed we've had discussions about sustainability appraisal and other parts of plan on that basis. (37:00)\nRebecca Harris MP\nIt is actually, unusually though, it is actually in the plan, as being a future potential site or is that not right?\nLewis Philip (PINS)\nIt’s referred to, but it's not a proposal in this plan and I think during the discussions we’ve had before, and I'm sure that maybe Mrs Parrot might want to mention this, the council have explained how it sees that site being considered for a future plan or review of the plan. But I’ll leave that for Mrs Parrot to explain, at this point.\nAmanda Parrot\nThank you Sir, so we prepared method statement two and we can send a copy of that across to Ms Harris if that's helpful to her, which does set out how we would intend to take forward the North West of Thundersley area and we've been in discussions with Homes England, as part of the seller partnership to get the resources and the framework in place to be able to deliver that particular scheme, but it isn't going to be easy. We need to do some work sort of independent of the County Council in 2015 to look at the access options to the North West of Thundersley area and the conclusions of that were that there really weren’t any suitable access options that didn't then involve significant changes to the strategic road network, which as Ms Harris mentioned are strongly resisted by the County Council. So it put us in a very difficult position at that time. So taking this site forward as part of a partnership approach with ASELA (Association of South Essex Local Authorities), which involves the County Council as one of those key stakeholders, it’s our intention to be able to bring this area forward, but it is a longer term site, it’s not something that we can deliver as part of the housing land supply at this point in time and I couldn't give a precise date at this point as to when that site would be considered to be deliverable or developable in the terms of the NPPF.\nLewis Philip (PINS)\nThank you, Ms Harris.\nRebecca Harris MP\nWell I'm just concerned that we find ourselves in a situation where the council is working on a site, which they said is not suitable for presumably within the plan period, a site which I understand is an alternative to the sites they are currently working on, it does seem strange that you're already discussion with Home England about this site, which is not in within the 15 year plan period. I would see this as a situation we're going to find now where we will find that we were going to lose everything. We already have our assessed need being accommodated, half of it on Green Belt sites already, and this will site come forward and will be over and above. So we lose everything in effect and clearly the work is going forward on that already, on the West Thundersley site and there are discussions clearly going on, but for some reason or other they have been excluded, in effect, from this local plan and the plan period and I find that very worrying. We can quite well see that we will be finding that site will be coming up for development well within the planning period and we have a double whammy for my residents, rather than protecting the Green Belt sites they’re worried about.\nLewis Philip (PINS)\nThank you, I’ve got a note of that, in terms of the planning period, as move we discussed in the previous session, the Council isn't seeking to have a plan that will deal with the 15-year life of strategic policies, as is required in the national planning policy framework. So the plan isn't seeking to have a 15-year supply of housing, we've had discussions about that and whether there is a need for a review mechanism as within the plan in order to roll it forward in effect and so if that were my conclusions, the Council would then be able to consider bringing in other sites North West Thundersley, or other options if they exist, at that point for a review in the plan.\nRebecca Harris MP\nBut not until we have already conceded the point on the other Green Belt sites, which my residents wish to protect. So at that point, you’re confirming my fear and my residents suspicions I suppose, that the council will bring that site forward having already adopted a plan which was condemned the other sites, which they seek to wish to protect, the ones they've got you know amenity and access. So, I’m very in favour of prevising, but once the plan is set in stone those sites - given the sites apparently in the plan of Green Belt - are condemned in effect, so that sort of doesn't really help me and my residence and in protecting the sites that we treasure.\nLewis Philip (PINS)\nYes, I understand that point but that’s the basis of the plan the Council have put to me to examine, so, but I do understand your point and I understand the Council’s position as well and I will take those into account when I am deliberating on the soundness of the plan.\nRebecca Harris MP\nThank you.\nLewis Philip (PINS)\nMrs Parrott.\nAmanda Parrot\nI have nothing ready additional to add at this point in time. This plan only goes up to 2033 and as the Government policy is write, we need to be putting plans in place that provides for 15 years supply and obviously that moves forward every year as the Government’s policy currently stands there will always be an additional demand for future housing, as each year progresses. So, in a place like Castle Point, you're going to find a situation where once you've lost a site, you've then having to look at the next site and then the next site, as time goes on and I think that's just a consequent of the system that we have in place in this country at the moment, and I completely understand Ms Harris’s position and the frustrations that actually brings. It is tight in Castle Point and we are going to get the point where actually there probably aren’t any sites left and that's the importance of working at South Essex level, then to try and find solutions to how we accommodate the growth needs of South Essex in terms of both housing, but also employment and the community facilities that go with that housing and employment. It is quite a frustrating situation in this part of Essex.\nLewis Philip (PINS)\nThank you. Are there any points Ms Harris for your representations that you have made to the Council that you would want the Council to address now or are you happy for the Council to provide copies of its statements and its response in that way?\nRebecca Harris MP\nI'm happy to seek answers in anyway, verbally or in written form, but as I said I was disappointed that I made a number of points about the evidence in the plan and the evidence against choosing - instead - the Thundersley site, instead of all the Green Belt they have put in the plan, and they have had many many years to bring the deliverability of that site, as I stated, and clearly they are in fact actually working towards that side even though it's not in the plan. So, I would very much like them to explain, if they can, the points I made, why they have got a situation whereby they have written the North West Thundersley site out of the plan, which therefore justifies putting in the rest of the Green Belt when it’s quite clear that even their own arguments against it they’re working to dismantle. I cannot see how the plan can be justified, because they are only able to put the Green Belt sites into the plan that they have by discounting the North West Thundersley site and we can call it an exception site, but that is how they constructed the plan. They have firstly, in my view, not justified the plan. They have not worked with other work that they needed to on the density of town centre and main road sites, and that’s clearly not evidenced, they've done that and they’ve said themselves it’s ‘historic’ work - they have not done that. So I don't see how they can justify moving onto Green Belt at all, because they haven’t demonstrated to me they’ve got the exceptional circumstances and we are constantly as well being told the objectively assessed need is not a target, there are other ways one can apply for strengths and we are very very constrained in many ways by water and infrastructure. But not only are they not in my view demonstrated through their policies that they have an exceptional circumstance, they then have by very poor evidence base to discount the Blinking Owl site have meant that we have to put in all these other Green Belt sites in their opinion and we now know that the Council is actually working to mitigate that site and could have done so in any times in the last 13 years. So it seems the plan, I do not think that is justified by the arguments I've made and the points on planning law terms, I think it is an unsound plan because they are working to make that site deliverable and have been quietly all along. So I think that there's evidence here that this is not a sound plan and you should consider the evidence based on that site. Thank you, I will leave it there.\nLewis Philip (PINS) 48.32\nOkay, thank you. One point I will make is when I'm considering the plan in the round, I will be obviously looking at the National Planning Policy Framework because that's where the test of soundness apply to, particular paragraph 11 and paragraph 11 says that strategic policy should meet for objectively assess needs, accept where for example application of policies in the framework that protect that assets or areas of particular importance because there is a strong reason for not doing so, just to paraphrase really, or whether the adverse impacts would significantly and adversely demonstrate don't demonstrably outweigh the benefits and so whilst the national planning policy says that local authorities should seek to meet their full needs it does actually say in paragraph 11, effectively where you can, if they're really good reasons why it shouldn't happen and that's what I will be taking into account having heard the evidence on flooding and transport and everything else that we discussed and will no doubt continue to discuss in the last day or so of the hearings.\nRebecca Harris MP\nThank you very much. I think there are a number of very serious constraints, including counting Green Belt as constraint to the way the plan has been constructed that should have been applied including the fact that we are surrounded by water.",
  "http_www_rebeccaharris_org_/http_www_rebeccaharris_org_foreign-aid/content_66.html": "Aid Spending\n(April 2024)\nIn the 2023 Autumn Statement, the Government stated that the independent OBR forecasts showed that the principles for a return to 0.7% GNI confirmed by Parliament in 2021 had not been met for 2024-25 and this should continue to reviewed and confirmed each year whether a return to spending 0.7% is possible. However, I welcome that the first provisional estimates show that in 2023, UK Official Development Assistance (ODA) was £15.374 billion, an increase of £2.589 billion or 20% on 2022. This is the highest level of ODA spent by the UK ever and similar to the last peak in 2019.\n(November 2022)\nThe Government has committed to return to spending 0.7% of Gross National Income on Official Developmental Assistance (ODA) when we are no longer borrowing for day-to-day spending and underlying debt is falling. In accordance with the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act 2015, this will continue to be reviewed and confirmed each year whether a return to spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA is possible against the latest fiscal forecast with spending assumed at around 0.5% of GNI until then.\nReflecting a significant shock to the economy and public finances, the independent OBR’s forecasts show that the principles for a return to 0.7% GNI confirmed by Parliament in 2021 have not been met. The UK remains a champion for international development as well as a leading donor. Last year the UK spent over £11 billion as ODA, making it the third largest G7 donor as a proportion of GNI.\nOver the past 12 months, the UK has acted decisively and compassionately to support the people of Ukraine and Afghanistan to escape oppression and conflict and find refuge here. The Government is providing additional resources of £1 billion in 2022-23 and £1.5 billion in 2023-24 to help meet the significant and unanticipated costs which have been incurred.\n(Vote July 2021)\nAt this time of unprecedented crisis, tough choices must be made, which is why I supported a temporary reduction in the UK’s aid budget from 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent of the UK's national income. I am assured the UK will return to 0.7 per cent when the fiscal situation allows. That is, as the Chancellor clarified on 12 July, when the Government is no longer borrowing for day-to-day spending and when debt is falling. I believe this the most economically prudent way in which to return to satisfying the 0.7 per cent target in light of the prevailing economic circumstances. I welcome that the Government, recognising the strength of feeling felt by many Members across the House on this matter – and even though it was not necessarily obliged to do so by the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act 2015 – gave Parliament a meaningful vote on its decision. I am glad that Parliament, recognising the need to manage the public finances responsibly and maintain strong investment in domestic public services, and voted to approve the Government’s plans.\nThe UK is still the biggest bilateral donor to the Global Partnership for Education, the largest fund in the world dedicated to improving education in developing countries; and the World Bank International Development Association, which works to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Likewise, our contribution to the COVAX AMC is amongst the largest, and will contribute to the supply of at least 1.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021, already reaching over 135 countries and economies.\n(November 2020)\nThe Chancellor announced in the 2020 Spending Review that the Government will prioritise our own domestic economic emergency and temporarily reduce international aid spending to 0.5 per cent of GDP. Allocating 0.7% of our national income on overseas aid is hard to justify right now as we have seen the highest levels of borrowing on record in peacetime, with £280bn spent to get our economy through Coronavirus. When we pledged to spend 0.7% in our manifesto, no one could have predicted the Coronavirus pandemic or indeed the long term affects it would have on our economy. The UK is facing the worst economic contraction in almost 300 years, and a budget deficit of close to £400 billion – which is double that of the last financial crisis. At this critical time, we need to prioritise our domestic emergency – prioritising jobs, livelihoods and our public services rather than sticking to rigidly spending 0.7 per cent of our national income on overseas aid.\nHowever, I am pleased that the Government will never step back from our commitments on the world stage, based on the latest OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) data the UK will remain the second highest aid donor in the G7. Higher than France, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US. The Government’s commitment to spend 0.5 per cent is considerably more than the 29 countries on the OECD’s development assistance committee – who average 0.38 per cent of their national income. You will also be pleased to know that it is also our intention to return to spending 0.7 per cent, when the fiscal situation allows.\nIn the meantime, the UK will continue to protect the world's poorest and will spend more than £10 billion next year to fight poverty, tackle climate change, support girls' education, resolve conflicts and improve global health. The UK has a proud track record, since 2015, we have helped almost 52 million people access clean water or improved sanitation, vaccinated 76 million children, and provided 14 million children with a decent education.\nIt is also important to note that whilst the aid budget has been temporarily reduced, the UK’s defence budget also helps increase economic prospects in fragile states to counter extremism and protect the most vulnerable in the international community. The UK military has helped in Disaster Relief Operations Overseas such as when Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Philippines in 2013 or after the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The UK contributes almost 6% to the overall UN peacekeeping budget and is the 6th largest funder. The British army is vital to these missions and has almost 600 troops deployed on UN peacekeeping operations around the world. For instance, an engineer task group of almost 300 personnel is deployed in South Sudan as part of operation Trenton. The UN mission involves using construction and the development of infrastructure to create conditions for peace and stability in the country. The task group has built hospitals, operating bases, bridges and made security improvements - benefitting thousands of local civilians. The British army upgraded 16 kilometres of road near a remote village, where women and children were required to walk long distances to collect food. Now the World Food Programme has better access to the village and the safety risks to the villages are dramatically reduced.\nUK’s Aid budget and Coronavirus.\nThe UK is using the aid budget to its full effect to counter the health, humanitarian and economic risks of the virus. The UK has committed aid to combat coronavirus and reinforce global efforts to find a vaccine.\nPersonally, I am proud that the UK is at the forefront of the global response to Covid-19. There has never been a more important time for us to be out in the world, helping the most vulnerable in the world’s poorest countries and showcasing what the UK has to offer globally in terms of our expertise, our science and our influence to convene an international response.\nThe UK is now the largest single contributor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), which is supporting the development of vaccines that will be available across the world. It is vital for the protection of the UK and the world that a vaccine is found and aid budget is enabling this.\nThe Department for International Development is leading the humanitarian support in the UK’s global efforts to combat the outbreak of Covid-19, including for those in refugee camps. This includes supporting World Health Organisation to help prevent the spread of the outbreak.\nThe Department for International Development and Unilever are also funding a programme to provide over 20 million hygiene products in the developing world, including areas where there is little or no sanitation. This support is vital to stop the spread of the disease in the developing world. Tackling the disease in developing countries will also reduce its potential future impact on the global economy and travel.\nAs we have all seen, coronavirus does not respect country borders. Health experts have identified the weakness of developing countries’ healthcare systems as one of the biggest risks to the global spread of the virus. the UK Government’s ability to protect the British public will only be effective if we strengthen the healthcare systems of vulnerable developing countries too.\nAid Spending Rules\nThe UK is working to update the Official Development Assistance (ODA) rules to ensure they reflect the breadth of UK assistance around the world. Reform is about getting the most out of the aid commitment for the world’s poorest and UK taxpayers. These efforts are building on the reforms to the Aid Budget that have been delivered in the past decade.\nCertain publications have made a number of inaccurate claims regarding the UK's foreign aid programme which grossly misrepresent the real situation. Indeed a number of the projects they refer to are no longer funded and have not been for quite some time. Overseas aid is massively in Britain's interest. There are rigorous checks to ensure that aid is spent only on projects approved by the UK Government. These media stories that suggest that vast amounts of UK taxpayer money is being funnelled into the bank accounts of dictators and other corrupt officials is nonsense. Indeed under this Government the UK has increased the proportion of aid which the British Government has final say over the destination of the funds, while decreasing the proportion of aid given to organisations like UN.\nAid spending is now more transparent and accountable. Details of Department for International Development (DFID) programmes are published on DevTracker, with spend over £500 and information for contracts worth over £10,000 published on GOV.UK. In addition, before financial aid is provided, DFID checks the risks of corruption and only provides funding if it is clear that the money will be used for the intended purposes.\nAn independent body to oversee aid spending was established in 2011 to scrutinise aid spending. The Independent Commission for Aid Impact, which examines ODA spend across government, assesses how Ministers can drive efficiency, value for money and reach those most in need.\nDFID has also stopped money going to ineffective aid organisations. The Multilateral Aid Reviews (MDRs) in 2011 and 2016 assessed multilateral agencies that received over £1 million in DFID core funding by testing alignment with UK priorities and their organisational effectiveness. On the basis of the 2011 review, Ministers took the decision to stop providing core funding to four institutions. Multilateral investments must be clearly justified in relation to UK priorities, multilateral performance and value for money, and, like all DFID programmes, are regularly assessed to ensure they deliver results, remain cost effective and prove good value for money for UK taxpayers.\nMerger of the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\nMany people have written to me regarding the recent announcement of the merger of Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) expressing their concerns. As the Government Whip for both the Foreign Office and DFID I have first-hand knowledge and experience of the relationship between the two departments and can reassure you that they have a long history of successfully working together. I am therefore confident that this merger will be in the best interests of our aid and diplomacy work abroad.\nThe new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) will place UK Aid at the heart of what it does, leveraging the development expertise of DFID through the reach of the FCO’s global network. The Prime Minister has been clear that this is not about rolling back commitments on international development, but about pursuing them with greater effect, and that reducing poverty will remain central to the UK’s international work. The UK remains committed to spending 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income on aid, being the only G7 country to have enshrined this in legislation.\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a timely example of why now – more than ever – foreign policy and aid objectives need to be joined up. The Government sees an ambitious vision for the future of the UK as an active, internationalist, problem-solving and burden-sharing nation. This will help us lead the way in tackling challenges, like stopping this disease.\nThe UK-hosted global vaccine summit in June is a prime example of what we, as a country, can achieve when we lead from the front. The summit brought together more than 50 countries. It smashed its funding target, raising over £7bn to help vaccinate people against a range of preventable diseases and prepare for the global distribution of a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine once one is developed.\nThis merger will mean that, within the new Department, we will see all the idealism and sense of mission that comes from DFID, alongside an understanding of the need to project UK values, UK policies and UK interests overseas. I have no doubt the new Department will deliver the UK’s ambitious international agenda. We are, and always have been, a bold and confident nation, unafraid to stand up for what we believe in. I see our development expertise working together with the best of British diplomacy as continuing squarely in that great tradition.",
