This meeting is a critical step in the budget-setting process scheduled for March. In an urgent effort to balance the books, we voted to transform the Council’s workforce, which will involve a reduction of around 11% in staffing levels to save approximately £34 million.\nRegrettably, the leadership of both the Conservative and Labour Parties seems more focused on assigning blame than confronting the realities we face. It is crucial that we collaborate across party lines for the benefit of our residents here in Somerset.\nLocal government is currently navigating very challenging times, impacting many essential services we rely on, from waste collection and road maintenance to education and social care—approximately 300 services in total. The scale of transformation at Somerset Council means we will need to prioritise statutory services and the most urgent issues moving forward, with non-essential services facing cuts. The repercussions of this decision will sadly be felt in our communities.\nVoting for staff transformation today was disheartening. Behind these figures are real people who will be affected. If we do not set a balanced budget next month, the government may intervene, sending in Commissioners to take over the Council. This could lead to substantial increases in Council Tax—potentially by over 20%—and severe cuts to services.\nRecent analysis from the Local Government Association (LGA) reveals that service spending in 2022/23 was 42.1% lower than it would have been if it had kept pace with cost and demand pressures since 2010/11. This significant shortfall indicates that councils have implemented a staggering £24.5 billion in service cuts and efficiencies over this period.\nThis situation leaves us all wondering why the government hasn’t addressed this issue more urgently. Answers on a postcard!\nI wish I had better news to share, but as a responsible Councillor, I believe it is my duty to be transparent with my residents. If anyone has questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to comment below or reach out to me here.",
  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_somersets-local-community-networks-time-to-have-your-say/content_123.html": "Somerset’s Local Community Networks – Time to Have your Say!\nA public consultation on the development of Local Community Networks (LCNs) launched this week. It will run for six weeks until Monday October 17th 2022. I’ve put together some key points, which I hope helps lead you into the consultation process.\nLCNs will be Committees of the new unitary Somerset Council, with formal decision-making powers and influence. They’ll be supported by dedicated officers and managers.\nIt has been proposed that LCNs will meet six to eight times a year, with locally led groups pursuing their goals between meetings.\nLCNs will influence the budgets and policies of the Council. The new administration will continue to review budget options to strengthen the ability of LCNs to support fairer, greener and flourishing communities in Somerset.\nAssets and services cannot be devolved to LCNs as LCNs are Committees and are part of the Somerset Council. Where Town, City and Parish Councils and local communities wish to take on council assets or services, because it makes good sense to do so, this can be considered, and LCNs could be a forum for facilitating this discussion.\nThere’s a dedicated email for any LCN enquires LCN@somerset.gov.uk; a website or call Somerset County Council direct on 0300 123 2224.\nIn-person engagement sessions will be advertised on the LCN consultation website. However I can highlight: 22nd September: 10-4pm, Mendip District Council for my Mendip South Communities.\nAs part of the online consultation survey (you will need to register and log in), you will see 3 options.\nProposal A would have 18 LCNs\nProposal B would have 17 LCNs\nProposal C would have 10 LCNs\nTo help assess the proposals, we looked at a range of factors, to enable comparisons to be drawn. We tried to think about where people live, work, go to school and access services including health. In all cases we kept to parish outlines as close as possible. The things we considered:\n• Population – we looked at how balanced the population numbers were in each LCN, how important or not is it that they have similar numbers of residents in each area\n• Geographies – how similar in size of area they were, and their distribution/spread across Somerset\n• Electoral Divisions – the number of Unitary Electoral divisions, and how they split within, and across, LCN boundaries\n• Deprivation – using indices of multiple deprivation, we looked at how the most and least deprived areas were distributed\n• Community Facilities, e.g. Libraries – we looked at where these were situated\n• Health – fit of Primary Care Network (PCN) boundaries to LCN boundaries (PCNs are explained further down in the FAQs)\n• Secondary School Catchment Areas – we checked how these were split in relation to LCNs, recognising schools are often at the heart of communities\n• Travel to Work Area – we looked at their alignment to LCN areas\n• Current Local Plan Geographies – we looked at their alignment to LCN areas\nSome of the potential roles are outlined here:\n• A Local forum which provides a time for discussion, listening and a mechanism for action, consultation and oversight. A community voice.\n• Bring together Somerset Council, partners including Health, Police, Parish/Town and City Councils, voluntary organisations and communities to work together to achieve local ambitions and improve outcomes for residents.\n• Identify local issues and priorities through the use of data and evidence.\n• Act as committees of Somerset Council, providing a local contact point for areas.\n• Promote active community decision making, provide a focus for local engagement and a way to engage all people.\n• A forum for engaging with council processes through new digital means.\n• Explore how best to support Planning and Licensing decision-making.\n• Provide information to support Asset of Community Value panels, which consider applications to give communities rights to buy or bid for council-owned assets, such as buildings or land, should they be offered for sale.\n• Access to and administration of local grants.\n• Enabling local activities which reduce the number of residents reaching crisis, in any form.\n• Promote and prioritise minor highways road maintenance and services at a local level.\n• Supporting Parishes to work together including across LCN boundaries\nThe new Council Executive believes in enabling local decision-making and is prepared to put planning and licensing back on the table for discussion as our Local Community Networks develop after vesting day.\nThank you for the summary. Sounds like an interesting idea.",

Funding challenges remain significant, as the widely criticised dental contract model compensates dentists based on Units of Dental Activity (UDAs) rather than the complexity of cases. This system incentivises many dentists to either reduce their NHS services or shift to private practice, that many Somerset residents can’t afford.\nIt was reported that workforce shortages due to Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic have further hindered capacity, making it difficult to recruit and retain dental professionals.\nThe dissatisfaction among NHS dentists related to workloads, administrative demands, and remuneration has led to early retirements and fewer new dentists entering the NHS. New dentist recruits and trainees are not moving to Somerset in significant numbers, for reasons not stated in the report.\nNHS Somerset urged Somerset Council to advocate for essential reforms in the dental contract, with plans to bring these issues to the attention of government officials and the wider Council.\nDo you have a distressing dental story?

Those householders could be due a £200 one-off payment from the government, but they must apply by 31 May.\nThe payment is aimed at people who do not use electricity or mains gas for domestic heating and who have not received a payment from their electricity supplier.\nHouseholders must supply an invoice or receipts to show that they have purchased at least £200 of alternative fuels since June 2022.\nThe second scheme is for households that have not received a £400 discount on their energy bills from an electricity supplier (in six instalments from Oct 2022 to March 2023). They may be entitled to a £400 one -off payment from the government.\nThe scheme is aimed at those who don’t pay directly to an electricity company for the energy they use in their home, for example residents of care homes, park home sites and people living above commercial property that does not have a separate meter for the domestic part.\nTo find out more about both schemes and to make an application, click here.\nFor anyone who may qualify for this support but does not have access to the internet, they can make an application to the government by telephone on 0808 175 3287, Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.\nAll applications must be made to the government and not to Somerset Council.",

They are looking to link buses, trains, cycle routes and footpaths.”\n“The Town Council is also seeking to develop Highbridge’s Regeneration Plan. They intend to review it in the light of recent events and create an Action Plan that will deliver its aims.”\n“One element of the original plan was centred on the train station. The Travel Plan will meet some of the objectives but we also seek to enhance the Station site and encourage economic development.”\n“The Town Council recently challenged GWR about lack of accessibility at the station. It is important that all this work comes together under one project.”\n“The meeting set the foundations for the project. Luke has agreed to allocate £5,000 to provide a Travel Plan for Highbridge. He has also given us the contact details of other agencies who we can work with to establish a Strategic Plan of work for the next 3 years.”\n“We were lucky that Somerset Councillor, Claire Sully, was able to join us. She will be supporting us on the project, representing us at Somerset Council.”\n“Personally, I am happy that we have established a team to push this agenda forward. Luke will be sharing his ideas at our next meeting at the beginning of December. I look forward to working in partnership to improve Highbridge Station for our residents and visitors.”\nClaire Sully, who is the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate for the new Bridgwater Constituency which includes Highbridge, adds: “I am working with, supporting and helping the Town Council to get the best outcomes for local people by working with partners, Somerset Council and GWR, in this case.”\n“Rather than solely see the challenges or talk about problems, we are looking at solutions that will build on the deep-rooted pride in our strong communities, throughout the constituency.

Since that time, Tory mismanagement of the economy and our essential services has got even worse, so I’m confident we can gain even more votes in the next general election.\nLib Dems have the potential to reach across the aisle and connect with otherwise partisan voters who can unite on wanting to see a locally driven change.

Wendy explained how Seed Of Hope are involved in renovating Avalon Priory in Chilton Polden and hope it will become a major attraction and asset for the community.\nClaire’s next guest speaker was Jamie from local charity In Charley’s Memory. The Highbridge-based organisation provides mental health support and counselling for children aged 11 and over. In Charley’s Memory were named in the Somerset Business awards as charity of the year in 2023 and their work addresses an area of growing need that is woefully underfunded by central government.\nThanking her speakers, Claire said both charities stories underlined the strength of community spirit and the importance of these vital grassroots organisations supporting mental health in the Bridgwater and Burnham area, part of the area’s potential that she was keen to shine a light on.\nClaire has worked closely with local charity organisers, community groups and local and national businesses and said she believes the constituency is among the most dynamic and exciting parts of the UK right now.\nIf elected on July 4th, Claire pledged to continue advocating for local people and working with the community to strengthen and improve the area, safeguarding and expanding services and providing jobs, homes and hope for local people.\nMusic at the event was provided by Somerset tenor Tim Pitman, a Burnham-on-Sea-based performer, who has worked with leading orchestras and at prestige events, and a Keralan meal was provided by Ajit, a local medical consultant who is also a successful restaurateur.",
  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_a371-what-is-going-on/content_125.html": "A371 – what’s going on?\nI have had five onsite Somerset Highways meetings in and around Evercreech, since being elected (May 2022).\nMendip South communities in Evercreech and surrounding areas, including Stoney Stratton, Ditcheat and Alhampton have been very concerned about recent traffic incidents, including fatalities, on the A371 (including by the Bath and West entrances, Leighton Lane, Pecking Mill corner and beyond).\nI have also been liaising with the Police to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities around road safety.\nFollowing local people’s concerns. and my discussions with Somerset Highways, both the Police and Somerset County Council are now monitoring the roads by gathering data, using speed monitoring rings.\nThey are looking to see if there is evidence to support extending speed restrictions and to understand how the road is currently being used. The data is being captured until around January 20th.\nMy hope is that speed restrictions will be lowered and extended further along the A361 to help make the road safer. I have to leave this to their determination (Police and Somerset Highways) of course, based on the evidence.\nI’ve met and spoken with local residents to gather insights and information to support the Police and Highways Officers. I am keeping Evercreech Parish Council up-to-date with developments, attending Parish Council meetings and updating via my usual County Council report.\nThe Police have told me:\n“I will be gathering speed data over the next few weeks, we will analyse all the collisions along with Somerset County Council and have a better understanding of what can be done.\nAfter two decades on Roads Policing investigating serious and fatal collisions, I would urge the community to not jump to conclusions as to how these collisions are caused. Very often we get jumped on due to speed, speed is a primary cause of injury type. An ingredient to the causation in some circumstances, but often not the primary cause. So we must do our homework first and see if we have a particular issue. What you can do for me is channel the community thoughts through me, via yourself to give us a better overall picture.”\nI was in touch with you about the Greencore site, some time back, I but failed to get back in touch for personal reasons (ditto the friend who wanted to talk to you, too.)\nIs there any point in setting up a Facebook page at this late stage to try to influence the powers that be? We feel the developer will almost certainly not provide the different kinds of housing wanted – whether from locals or from ‘blow-ins’! This could end up leading to another disastrous housing estate and we’ve been so lucky so far as the developments in Evercreech have been pretty good ones. It’ll be a terrible condemnation of government policy if the centre of town development lets the whole village down, but it’s the village that will suffer.\nHi Charmian, it’s probably worth you speaking with Evercreech Parish Council and getting up to speed with this planning application and appeal.\nMy e-mail is claire.sully@somerset.gov.uk if you have any queries.",

This has not recovered with passenger numbers currently at 65% of pre-covid levels.\nMaking this a perfect storm for bus operators, they are also experiencing a severe shortage of bus drivers.\nThe withdrawal of Government support for buses could have serious consequences for many of our communities in the county. As plans become clear in the coming weeks, Somerset County Council will set out exactly what we intend to do. In the meanwhile, the Lib Dems in Somerset have been leading on campaigns to save specific bus routes.",

He told me that he was one of the last Dairy Farmers in the village (where we met) and that many of his generation were leaving farming for good, while younger folk weren’t stepping up into the profession.\nHe said “people will have a shock when Dairy Farming stops around here”.\nThen I spoke to Max! From next month, for 12 months, Max is going to farm from his own small patch of land to achieve 100% food self-sufficiency. He says he will only eat “what I can produce, nothing else”. He is turning his abandoned small holding into a food producing farm come what may. Clearly Max is making a statement with his endeavour. Are we in danger of losing the connection with our farming irrevocably? Have we lost the plot when it comes to our relationship with eating seasonally, sourced locally?\n“Farmers don’t need support, or help, they need sensible policies!” Max stressed to me. And he told me to watch the Minette Batters videos on the NFU website to start to understand the challenges facing farming today.\nWhy do we need to talk about farming and why is this on my plate?\nMendip South comprises of rural communities, with farming at it roots. I grew up in Hornblotton, amongst the farming communities. I now represent these communities. I am not a farmer, but I am a determined Councillor who wants to support my local community, rural community, farming community.\nWhat is troubling farming? There is a lot to discuss, here’s just a few pointers, in no particular order.\n- Rising energy costs and inflation\n- The future of trade deals\n- Access to available workforce (40% of growers reported losses recently, because of lack of access to workers)\n- Sorting out a statutory profile for food production – making food production a primary political profile\n- Climate change\n- Taking land out of production\n- Re-educating our eating and buying habits\n- Considering large scale versus small scale (a couple of fields, does veg boxes locally, a few pigs and some sheep while there are more than 1,000 US-style mega-farms in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, including some holding as many as a million animals)\nMax advised me, don’t just talk to me, talk to the farmers around here. I will Max. However, I will keep talking to Max and I will watch his farming experiment and learn too. I think we all need to watch, learn and talk about Farming.",

I achieve this through my community campaign work and political policy development, empowering individuals and communities to ensure their voices are heard while actively working to make a difference in my role as a Councillor.\n.\nMy background:\nGrowing up in economically challenged areas of Somerset inspired my commitment to improving lives through professional, political, and community efforts.\nElected to Somerset Council in 2022, my colleague and I successfully replaced two Conservative councillors with over 50 years of combined experience, and I topped the vote\nAs a Unitary Councillor, I have a strong record of uniting communities, effectively campaigning, and advocating for my residents.\nMy journey from community champion and parish councillor to unitary authority councillor was driven by my concern for mental health issues in Somerset. I currently serve as the Deputy Chair of the ruling Somerset Lib Dem Group, the largest Lib Dem group in the country outside of Parliament, and as Acting Chair of the Adults and Health Scrutiny Committee. In this role, I've integrated suicide prevention into our work program. Additionally, I’m a member of the National Lib Dem Mental Health Policy Development Group.\nI tackle complex casework relentlessly for the best outcomes for my residents. A notable success was securing road safety improvements on the busy A371, a project previously deemed impossible.\nMy commitment to empowering communities to have a say in what matters to improve lives is demonstrated by our successful campaign against EDF's plans for a large saltmarsh at Pawlett Hams. By helping local residents form an action group, we influenced the decision to halt the project, preserving vital ecosystems and community spaces. This initiative highlighted the power of collective action and our dedication to protecting our landscape.\nI have also campaigned for a family trapped in poverty due to an indifferent Conservative government, which garnered national media attention, including coverage by the BBC. I organised a fundraising campaign essential for their daily needs, helping them achieve justice.\nAdditionally, I authored a paper on the Gender Pay Gap presented to the equality panel at Somerset Council.",

Chairing the session was Cllr Lesley Millard, with the panel hearing from bus users on their experiences and pleas for a better service.\nBus users detailed how the buses were unreliable and that communication from First Group was patchy. A student, who said he wanted to ensure young people’s voices were heard by the bus company, said how he and his friends were often late for college. Other bus users who spoke included parents of students that struggled going to work while feeling a lack of confidence in the bus service to turn up to take their children to college. A key issue raised was not being provided information when a bus was running late, not stopping or not turning up altogether.\nOther feedback from users included there not being enough seats on buses, and students having to stand for up to an hour. The bus user group asked: ‘Should there be double-decker buses?’\nIt was commented that there was no bench at some stops, or covers for when it rained, while other complaints included the Bus App not being reliable and the company failing to provide updates on X (formerly Twitter).\nYoung people and other users are frequently left stranded and are often late into college. Buses breaking down make travel to college difficult, and it’s a worry. “It is totally not on leaving young people isolated abandoned,” said Cllr Millard during the session.\nIn response, First Bus explained some of the challenges affecting the service, including workforce shortages. They said they were looking to encourage female drivers to join the company. George Burton, Head of network, First Bus, said: “It breaks my heart to hear the issues you have experienced.” He continued: “You are a priority number one.”\nFirst Bus said they have a new team starting, who are accomplished and experienced and hope this will improve the service. Peter McNaughton from First Bus added: “We are not quick enough with communities in providing real time information when there are issues with buses.”\nMr McNaughton said they have taken on an extra member of staff and they are conducting weekly service reviews. First Bus said they value the work of the bus user group and Somerset Bus Partnership.\nCllr Richard Wilkins, lead member for Transport at Somerset Council, said: “First Bus has a lot of problems and this needs to be sorted quickly. Reliability is key, if buses aren’t reliable people stop using them. That is unacceptable.”\nSomerset Council’s John Perrett, added: “Our job is co-ordination for buses we fund. For buses that are commercial (like the services discussed today) we are limited, but we can listen and try to influence. We have seen improvements in a year. It seems communication is an issue. We will keep talking to colleges and bus advisory groups to understand what isn’t working.”\nFollowing the User Group feedback, Cllr Millard asked: “What can we do better? We need to aim high. We can’t begin to promote the service until we see improvements.”\nCllr Millard said bus users had provided a clear picture, citing a lack of communication at the heart of the issue, leaving students abandoned.\nShe said: “There is no info on what is going on. Arriving students at college are anxious. It is frustrating that a working group was set up one year ago and there seems to be little improvement.”\nRepresentatives from Bridgwater & Taunton College said: “The college has recruited a member of staff to support students who have challenges with buses. The college is limited with what it can do with the 21 service as it’s not a chartered service.”\nThe college said they have regular meetings with the bus company.\nClaire Sully said: “First Bus have shown a willingness to improve these services, in particular the 20 and 21/21A services, and I am grateful for their cooperation. We must now see them deliver on their promises to improve services and communication to bus users.\n“I, together with Cllr Wilkins, will continue to discuss these issues with Bus companies and those affected.”",

The draft strategy draws on three key areas:\n- Data and Evidence\n- Evaluation\n- Engagement\nSuicide remains the biggest killer of men aged 49 and under, and the leading cause of death in people aged 20 to 34. Suicide is also the leading cause of direct deaths 6 weeks to a year after the end of pregnancy.\nSuicide is a health inequality issue. There are well established links between suicide and social fragmentation and socioeconomic circumstances.\nSomerset Council, through its health and wellbeing duties, holds responsibility for ensuring that appropriate and sufficient local arrangements are in place to prevent suicide, this work is coordinated with partners through the multi-agency Suicide Prevention Partnership Forum.\nWhen talking about suicide prevention we are helping to break down the barriers or stigma around suicide. The experts believe suicide can be prevented with the right interventions.\nOur new local strategy is based on the 8 national strategic priorities (below) detailed within the national strategy.\nImproving data and evidence\n- Tailored, targeted support to priority groups\n- Addressing common risk factors at a population level\n- Promoting online safety and responsible media content to reduce harms\n- Providing effective crisis support across sections\n- Reducing access to means and methods of suicide\n- Providing effective bereavement support to those affected by suicide\n- Making suicide everybody’s business\nAn event called Walk for a Life has been organised to remember those we have lost to suicide, raise awareness, and encourage and empower people in Somerset to take action to prevent suicide.\nA Walk for a Life is on Sept 7th, Walk start time: 10.30am, meeting House, Bath Place, Taunton, Somerset, TA1 4EP.\nTraining we can do includes: Every Life Matters and Orange button Community Awareness Scheme.\nThere will be continuing annual updates to the Adults and Health Scrutiny committee evaluating the local suicide prevention strategy.",

The budget’s approval would starve off the inevitability of issuing of a Section 114 notice and bankruptcy, a devastating prospect which would result in unelected commissioners appointed to decimate the council’s vital services in order to make extreme savings.\nThe budget was voted through by 52 votes to nine, with 31 abstentions.\nOne in five councils in England and Wales say they fear the prospect of issuing a Section 114 notice of bankruptcy, while S114 notices have already been issued for councils in Nottingham, Woking, Thurrock, Croydon and Birmingham since November 2022. Birmingham City Council had their budget set by unelected commissioners on February 19, with council tax hiked by 21%, while £300 million in savings will be required over the next two years, as services are stripped to provide residents with only those that are essential, representing the largest budget cut in local authority history.\nBill Revans, leader of the Liberal Democrat administration on Somerset Council, said councillors faced ‘a stark choice’ at the Full Council meeting and Labour’s decision to vote against the budget while ‘offering no alternatives’ represented ‘a lack of responsibility’.\n“The choice for Somerset Council was stark: set a balanced budget or declare a S114 notice – bankruptcy – and have unelected government commissioners appointed to run the council,” Cllr Revans said.\n“While the Liberal Democrat administration is working hard to keep Somerset Council going, the Labour group offered no alternatives and are taking no responsibility to help get through this. At a time when Somerset voices need to unite together, it’s disappointing some are seeking to divide us.”\nLabour’s leader on Somerset Council, Leigh Redman, represents the Bridgwater North and Central division, and Cllr Claire Sully, the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate for Bridgwater, believed Labour’s decision to oppose the ‘life-saving’ budget was reckless.\n“After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that Somerset Labour do not have the best interests of our residents in mind,” Cllr Sully said.\n“When faced with a clear choice to either vote through a life-saving budget, one which would see the continuation of many crucial services to residents, or risk the financial implosion of the council resulting in a decimation of services that people rely on, they chose the latter.\n“Fortunately, their reckless decision to oppose the budget will not result in a Section 114 notice being issued in Somerset, thanks to the work of the Liberal Democrats.”",
  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_new-year-misery-for-nhs-staff-in-the-new-bridgwater-constituency-as-government-fails-to-deliver-promised-pay-increase/content_132.html": "New Year misery for NHS staff in the new Bridgwater Constituency as government fails to deliver promised pay increase.\nChristmas and New Year should be a time of cheer and happiness but for many NHS workers in Somerset, a failed government promise of a 6% pay increase will heap more misery on an already overworked and stretched workforce.\nIn July last year, the government announced funding would be made available to implement a 6% pay increase for all GPs and practice staff, backdated to April 2023. However, Symphony Healthcare Services, an NHS contractor operating GP surgeries primarily in Somerset and Devon, have conceded that the “funds are not available” and that there are “no other ‘pots’ to call upon” to implement the much needed pay increase for staff.\nDespite this broken promise, announced over Christmas, Rishi Sunak stated on BBC Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg (7/1/2024), stating that all NHS pay disputes were resolved, apart from the current Junior Doctors strikes.\nSymphony, who operate Burnham and Berrow Medical Centre, Highbridge Medical Centre and North Petherton Surgery, have said they will not be able to offer the promised 6% increase to many of its staff due to a lack of funding from the government, accusing them of ‘ambiguous’ messaging when the pay increase was first announced in July 2023.\nIn a communication to staff on December 14, 2023, Symphony Healthcare Services said: “In October 2023, the details of the increase in funding were clarified and it was apparent that the July communication was somewhat ambiguous. All avenues to fund the shortfall have been explored but regrettably the organisation cannot afford to make any further pay increases – the funds are simply not available and there are no other ‘pots’ to call upon.”\nSymphony handed its workers a minimum 2.5% pay increase in April 2023 which, in many instances, ensured staff would not fall below the National Minimum Wage threshold in England. The latest revelations are yet another setback for NHS workers, who have been once again let down by the Conservative government reneging on its promises.\nSymphony said that in the subsequent details released by government in October on how the promised 6% pay increase would be met, the ‘additional funding’ included the increase in funding that was provided in April 2023.\nThe update from Symphony to its staff added: “This meant that the total increase in funding only just covered the pay increases that had already been passed on in April. Furthermore, once the contractual 6% pay increase to GPs in factored in, Symphony has used up more than the additional funding provided.”\nClaire Sully, the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the new Bridgwater Constituency, has decried yet another failure of the Conservative government to follow through on pay promises made to NHS staff.\n“We cannot trust this Conservative government to deliver what it has promised on the NHS,” Claire said. “This latest failed promise wrapped in Conservative party spin will heap misery and uncertainty on many NHS staff at a time we look for optimism and comfort over Christmas and into the New Year.\n“The Conservative government is dismantling our doctors’ surgeries from the inside, through the erosion of workforce pay and conditions which has resulted in a proliferation of staff vacancies, an overstretched workforce and a lack of available appointments for patients.\n“If elected as your MP for Bridgwater, the provision of NHS services and GP surgeries will be a top priority with primary care a service which must be fixed.”\nClaire has continued to campaign for improved NHS provision and pay and conditions for its staff. Earlier this month, Claire and many supporters undertook a run from Somerset Bridge Medical Centre to East Quay Medical Centre in Bridgwater in order to highlight the severe funding issues in our NHS caused by years of Conservative neglect.",

The Liberal Democrats have a plan to ensure our stunning natural landscapes are not only preserved, but they thrive.”\nLiberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “Our National Parks are some of the most beautiful in the country.\n“The Conservative Party has broken too many promises to protect our countryside.

By talking more openly about suicide, we can give people the chance to express how they feel and get the support they need. It could even save a life.\nSuicide remains the biggest killer of men aged 49 and under, and the leading cause of death in people aged 20 to 34. Suicide is also the leading cause of direct deaths 6 weeks to a year after the end of pregnancy. You can read more about Suicide Prevention Work in Somerset here. The rate for suicide in Somerset has generally been slightly higher than the England average over the past twenty years. However, between 2015-17 and 2019-21 the rate in Somerset began to increase year-on-year at a rate much higher than was observed in the national average. Mendip has the highest rate of suicide.\nAlong with Councillor colleagues, including the Leader of Somerset Councillor, Cllr Bill Revans, I attended the third annual ‘Walk for a Life’ event in Taunton, to mark World Suicide Prevention Day (September 10th).

They told us that EDF has until January 2025 to submit their plans to the Planning Inspectorate.”\nClaire also brought to the EA’s attention the plight of a tiny aquatic beetle just a few millimetres in size. This rare insect could be at risk if the area is flooded. Pawlett Hams is well-known in aquatic beetle circles and the EDF proposals would certainly lead to a serious diminishing of freshwater aquatic biodiversity for little seeming biodiversity gain, and a huge loss of fish from the Severn Estuary. Other wildlife that could be lost includes great crested newts, water voles and hares.\nEDF is building two new nuclear reactors, the first in a new generation of nuclear power stations in Britain providing zero-carbon electricity for around six million homes. Hinkley Point C could cost around £46 billion, and the delayed completion date is now reported to be 2031. But for locals, living in a nearby village, there is another cost they are having to bear. A nature reserve, and prized local asset, next to Hinkley C, Pawlett Hams, could be flooded and turned into a salt marsh at a reported cost of £50m to “compensate” for the immense number of fish being sucked into Hinkley Point C’s cooling pipes.\nThe salt marsh could be as big as 313 hectares (773 acres) along the River Parrett at Pawlett, near Bridgwater. The Guardian reported this as the “odd Hinkley Point C salt marsh plan“. EDF has rolled back on its initial plan to save millions of fish by installing an “acoustic fish deterrent” (AFD) system, due to safety reasons, and this was essential to EDF not causing harm to the Severn Estuary.\nThe salt marsh is to compensate for the loss of fish life. The Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary are hugely important habitats for many species, including salmon and eels. EDF’s salt marsh proposal could affect part of the Somerset levels – where Saxon king Alfred the Great is said to have hidden from the Vikings. Land affected would include farmland used for grazing, as well as a nature reserve. Many locals are vehemently opposed to EDF’s salt marsh plans and are standing up for their local wildlife.\nThanks for the update Claire as I didn’t find out the event was on until after it had been and gone.

The foodbank is funded entirely by donations from members of the public and local businesses, including Hinkley Point, who helped fund the new annex building, allowing the foodbank to better support people in need.\nPhil Jarman, manager of the Bridgwater Foodbank, said the cost-of-living crisis was not only resulting in more people needing to use the facility, but was also having an effect on donations to help keep up with the increase in demand.\n“People in Bridgwater and surrounding villages have been extremely generous, but more and more people are feeling the pinch, meaning donations are dropping,” he said.\n“People need better support in a wide range of social services to simply get families back to where they need to be.”\nAfter her visit, Claire said: “It is a failure of government that so many people are pushed into such desperate situations that they need to visit a foodbank to cater for the very basics in their need to survive.\n“We need to bring back a decency and compassion to politics and treat people as human beings. The work of the courageous and generous volunteers who help sustain this life support for people is admirable, and I commend Ann and Phil and their wonderful team of volunteers on their commitment to providing for those in need.\n“This visit provides a stark reality of how desperate life has become for some in society and as politicians we need to focus on finding a solution where we don’t need food banks in the first place, as MP I will do this.”\n“Voters are faced with a clear choice at the election on July 4: better politics with Claire Sully and the Liberal Democrats which prioritises people, or more failure and decline under the Conservatives.”",

These operations are lifesaving and high risk.\nTeddy is his wife’s full-time carer.\nRent and energy bills take most of their income and they rely on food banks to get by.\nAs an American citizen, Sossa is not eligible for disability benefits, and Teddy cannot claim carers’ allowance because Sossa is not receiving disability benefits (based on entitlement instead of eligibility). The family is disqualified for the 30 hours free childcare because of Sossa’s status – they have a 4 year old son.\nTeddy would work, if vital care was available for his wife. Meaning Sossa could safely be with someone 24/7 in case of seizures (side effects of Sossa’s renal failure include seizures, gout, & worse).\nSossa is one year off from applying for Permanent Residence in the UK, but her application could be rejected if she were to access life-saving public funds, as her visa takes no account of kidney failure or any further hardships thrust upon upstanding people when it states carelessly, “no access to public funds”.\nThey need immigration to advance their case by 12 months – and I am looking into (with the help of Lib Dem colleagues) how we can make that happen. They did ask David Warburton MP for help, and initially he was going to help their “extreme situation” but he has taken time off due to his ill health and their case seems to have been dropped by his office.\nTo help them raise the money for the visa application process they have set up their own GoFundMe page.\nThe people in the bureaucratic system Teddy and Sossa deal with want to help them, but the bureaucracy is the barrier, so their hands are tied.\nShould people suffer at the hands of bureaucracy?

  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_in-memory-of-ruth-ellis-bridging-history-and-hope-for-future-generations/content_26.html": "In Memory of Ruth Ellis: Bridging History and Hope for Future Generations\nI dedicate today, International Women’s Day, to the memory of Ruth Ellis. Ruth, who died at age 28, was the last woman to be hanged in this country on July 13, 1955. She was convicted of murder.\nRuth’s life and death is a poignant reminder of the struggles many women have faced and continue to face regarding violence, coercive control, and justice. Ruth’s experience highlights the societal and legal changes that emerged from her tragic case, reflecting the ongoing need for awareness and advocacy for women’s rights and protections against domestic violence. Remembering her sacrifice inspires a commitment to #accelerateaction towards equality and justice for all women today and in the future.\nThe then Home Secretary, Gwilym Lloyd George, rejected fresh evidence that on the day she shot her former lover David Blakely, she had been drinking for many hours with another man, Desmond Cussen, who had handed her an “oiled and loaded gun,” driven her to the scene of the murder, and encouraged her to kill Blakely. Ruth’s young son witnessed Cussen teaching Ruth to use a gun. Other witness accounts at the time said Cussen and Blakely were rivals in their attempts to control Ruth’s affection.\nThere was evidence that Ruth was traumatized by frequent acts of violence from Blakely. He had beaten Ruth so badly that she miscarried their baby just a couple of weeks before she shot him. In addition to the physical violence, there are suggestions of coercive control and psychological abuse that may have led Ruth to “snap.” When she was hanged, she was still suffering from the aftereffects of her miscarriage.\nRuth suffered a lifetime of violence from men who tried to control her physically and sexually; her father was a pedophile who abused her from age 11, and her first husband was violent towards her.\nThe Home Office sufficiently believed the claims that Ruth Ellis had been acting under the influence of Cussen to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to examine whether he should be charged as an accessory before the murder. This was significant because a stay of execution should have been ordered while the new evidence was investigated. A conviction of manslaughter would have saved her life.\nRuth was found guilty of murder in a matter of minutes in court, and she was hanged within weeks. It was a race against time, with a backdrop of misogyny and classism that ultimately defeated her. Despite many people at the time seeing through the conviction, many tried to overturn the verdict. 50,000 people signed a petition to spare Ruth Ellis’s life, but the petition was denied.\nAfter Ruth died, in 1957, the principle of diminished responsibility was established in England, and in 1965 capital punishment was abolished. The aftershock of her hanging is believed to have influenced the change in law. Coercive control became a criminal offense in England and Wales on December 29, 2015, through Section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015.\nThose who knew Ruth—friends, family, and those in the last few days of her life—said that she was a strong and brave woman. Ruth didn’t survive, but her life had an impact on laws and attitudes that affect women today.\n#IWD2025 #Internationalwomensday #AccelerateAction #Metoo #acruellove #ITVX @LucyBoynton1\nA powerful story, thank you for sharing",

It seems I’ve never reached this village the same way twice, as you glide in the steep valley of the River Alham (5 miles south-east of Shepton Mallet) through tiny hamlets, on undulating roads. Batcombe village, is at the heart of the parish, which also includes the hamlets of Westcombe, Spargrove and Eastcombe (historically Ashcombe). Batcombe is also in the east of my County Councillor Mendip South ward.\nI was heading to Batcombe for breakfast. Since the Second World War, the village, with its surrounding areas provides a Christmas party for local children. Keeping with this tradition today’s Batcombe breakfast was a fundraiser to pay for this Christmas party.\nThe Old School House was bustling as the community, including many young families, gathered to taste local produce and look for bargains at the car boot sale, which was held outside.\nOne of the many interesting conversations I had was speaking with Abby and Steve, who are helping to set up a Batcombe Environmental Group, with the augural meeting being held on Wednesday, 7pm, 21st September at the Village Hall. Steve told me that he wanted to see what local people can do collectively to live more environmentally friendly.\nI also enjoyed meeting a beekeeper who’s company (Black Bee Honey) supplies amongst others, The National Trust. This was not the only honey producer here today: Alham Valley honey was for sale at the car boot. This honey endeavour began when a local carpenter found an empty bee hive at one of the sites he was working at, and before he could dispose of it bees settled in. Some 14 years later the honey still flows.",

Any last words?\nCowboy (calm and firm): Maybe. But I’ve fought for what’s right. I won’t turn tail now, even if it costs me everything.\n[The bandit hesitates, gun still aimed.]\nCowboy: Do your worst. I’ll stand firm, till the very last shot.\nHello. Are you one of us? When you wake up—whether consciously or unconsciously—do you want to make the world a better place? Make the day count? If that feels a little too much like a grand gesture, maybe you’re simply the kind soul who gives to others: joins in, volunteers when asked, dons the marigolds and does the washing-up at a community event, or counts the coins at the end of church. You might be part of a club, a group, a special interest organisation then organises the lot—or all of the above.\nAre you a Mr or Mrs (Miss, Ms, or none of the above) Your _______ Community? I will leave you to fill the blank.\nIt’s an easy slope to slip down, from being that person who just does things and can’t say no—but always says, “Yes, hell yes!”—to accidentally, or maybe deliberately, morphing into a role in local government: parish councillor, town, city, or Unitary councillor. Before you know it, you’re caught in the official web of community service— with official strings, and no blessings.\nIt’s recognized that giving to public service benefits our own well-being. Those of us who become local councillors accept the role of representing our communities. Deep inside ourselves, we think, Yes, I can do that. We are called leaders, we are community leaders!\nWe are the instruments of local democracy, keeping the civic wheels turning or griding along —delivering services that are vital to our everyday lives, sometimes with big budgets, 100s of millions for a unitary authority.\nWhile we give countless hours to Parish Councils, Town, City, County, or Unitary meetings, and respond to hundreds of emails on roads, buses, flooding, schools, pest infestations, poo bins, fly-tipping, planning, planning, planning —yes, there can be three times as many emails—and more, most people don’t really understand what we do, what our role is, or what powers we have on their behalf.\nThey often see us as worth little more than a lick of paint, question our motivations, call us horrible names online, or complain about what we don’t do—mistakenly thinking we do—and overlook just how much we actually do do. Set up to fail, as it was if fixing something that in their mind shouldn’t have been unfixed.\nIt’s not quite “what did the Romans ever do for us”; it’s more like hearing the exasperated groan of what does the Council actually do for you, beyond what we do do (you just didn’t realise we did that too).\nSo, what is important to me? I went down that slide and landed somewhat on my feet — a wobble here, a wobble there — but I rose through the ranks. It’s important to me to act like a professional councillor, to fight the corner for those who feel they have no voice, in this wild west of local government terrain, even when shells and shots fly over my head, and as I stick my neck out above the parapet. I want to make the world — the communities I am part of — a better place.",

A total of 3,571 racially-motivated hate crimes were recorded during the last year, a rise of nearly 50% on 2017, while the number of hate crimes towards disabled people have increased by more than 80%, totalling 774 in 2023/24.\nThe biggest rise in hate crime in Avon and Somerset is transphobic-related, with the number of recorded hate crimes in this area having risen a staggering 182% on seven years ago.\nPride Month, a celebration of the LBGTQ+ community, begins on June 1 and Claire said the latest figures, released by the Avon & Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner after a freedom of information request, demonstrate a shocking trend in rising hate towards minority groups, calling on politicians of all leanings to demand a kinder approach to politics.\n“These new figures showing soaring hate crime in Avon & Somerset are extremely worrying,” Claire said.\n“As politicians, we set the narrative and have a responsibility to moderate our language and foster an inclusive, tolerant society. Vulnerable groups have been increasingly let down by the words of some politicians in recent years. There is no place for hate in our communities.”\nI think we have all been let down by politicians in recent years. This is not grabbing my vote which is lost and confused.\nI want to be part of a better politics, one that prioritises people. In order to do that I need to raise issues like I have in this article.\nI’ve tried to get across who I am and why I am standing in many ways, like articles, media, literature, but ultimately I like to meet and talk with people.\nI like to build connections with the communities and be active and get things done.\nHere is more information about me:\nhttps://clairesully.com/3d-flip-book/claires-magazine/\nIf you want to have a chat e-mail me: contactclairesully@gmail.com\nClaire",

He has not attended a single hustings event and caused the cancellation of two further hustings. This is not the appropriate actions of a future MP and residents of the Bridgwater constituency deserve much better.\n“I am out listening to business owners, offering the Liberal Democrat vision for the economy. I am listening to constituents across Bridgwater, Burnham, Highbridge and North Petherton, working hard for communities and championing projects. There is only one candidate who is capable of delivering for Bridgwater, and that’s Claire Sully and the Lib Dems.”\nOn the economy and business, Claire Sully clashed with Conservative candidate Ashley Fox over his party’s failure to adequately fund local councils up and down the country, while criticising the Conservatives’ record in delivering for businesses across the Bridgwater region.\nClaire was the only candidate to remain at the Business Expo event after the hustings, speaking to business owners and listening to their needs to see their businesses flourish.\n“The Conservatives have caused a financial crisis in local government,” Claire said. “One in five councils in England and Wales fear going bankrupt and issuing a Section 114 notice, something which has already happened to five councils, including the Tory-run Thurrock Council.\n“Furthermore, business closures across Sedgemoor have increased by 92% since 2018, the third highest in the whole country.\n“The Conservatives have failed business, but in the Liberal Democrats there is a plan to rejuvenate the high street and boost the economy. Business owners across Bridgwater are now looking to the Lib Dems to secure a brighter future.”",

Championing communities and striving for a fair deal for you, our constituents, is what we stand for, and my promise is that I will prioritise people.\n“The Conservatives have taken for granted our communities in Bridgwater, Burnham and Highbridge for too long. If you want integrity, decency and good, sound policies to fix our country, then a vote for Claire Sully and the Liberal Democrats is for you.”\nA headline £9 billion investment in the NHS and social care is at the forefront of the Liberal Democrat manifesto, with a promise to recruit 8,000 GPs and cut waiting times to see a GP to no more than seven days.\nDriven by Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey’s, own experience caring for his disabled son, the Liberal Democrats are promising to value the work of carers, recognising their contribution to our society.\nThe Conservatives promised that no one would have to sell their house to pay for social care. They have failed, plunging many older residents of our communities into financial anxiety.\nThe Liberal Democrats will introduce free personal care for older and disabled people at home, while valuing the carers in our society with a raise in the minimum wage for care workers by £2/hour.\nOn the economy, which has been so devastatingly mismanaged by the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats will support small businesses and invest in our workforce to prepare for a modern, productive economy, with renewable energy at its core.\nWe will seek to improve our relationship with our European neighbours, implementing a plan to rejoin the single market, with Brexit having cost the UK an estimated £32 billion/year to the UK taxpayer.\nIn a YouGov poll released on Monday, it was found that the three most popular policies released to date are from the Liberal Democrats, who understand what people are going through.\nAll policies for the Liberal Democrats are fully costed, with reversing the tax cut on banks, a windfall tax on the super-profits of gas and oil companies, and closing the tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy at the centre of plans for funding policies.",

They work by collecting heat from an external source of air, ground, or water – and then concentrate the heat using a pump, making them three times more efficient than a gas boiler. They are basically a fridge working in reverse pumping concentrated heat into the home heating system from external sources.\nBecause they are more energy efficient, they produce less greenhouse gas emissions. A typical air source heat pump produces 850kg of CO2 per year compared to gas boilers producing 2,500 kg of CO2 and oil-fired heating 5,200 kg, plus the carbon impact of delivering the oil to homes.\nIn Somerset, it is thought that around 7,300 homes have already installed heat pumps, while 277,000 need to be installed by 2050 to meet decarbonisation requirements and to support more energy efficient heating solutions for householders in Somerset.\nIt is estimated that nationally nearly 100,000 people search for heat pumps online each month, but installations have not kept pace with this demand.\nFor more information about Retrofit Somerset, explore www.retrofitsomerset.info\nBuses of Somerset – strike action announced\nBus services provided by Buses of Somerset (BoS) could be subject to further disruption as a result of industrial action next week.\nThe RMT has announced two days of strike action on Friday 9 August and Monday 12 August, along with two days of industrial action withholding overtime on Saturday 10 and Sunday 11 August.\nNegotiations continue, but if the action goes ahead the disruption will only affect the BoS services, provided by First Bus South, not other providers operating in the county.\nThe extent of the disruption would not be known until the days of action themselves.\nSomerset Council will do its best to communicate affected services to the public alongside any communications by BoS across social and local media.\nIn the event of strike action, unfortunately no service can be guaranteed and all may be subject to last minute change.

The draft strategy draws on three key areas.\nSuicide remains the biggest killer of men aged 49 and under, and the leading cause of death in people aged 20 to 34. Suicide is also the leading cause of direct deaths 6 weeks to a year after the end of pregnancy.\nSuicide is a health inequality issue. There are well established links between suicide and social fragmentation and socioeconomic circumstances.\nSomerset Council, through its health and wellbeing duties, holds responsibility for ensuring that appropriate and sufficient local arrangements are in place to prevent suicide, this work is coordinated with partners through the multi-agency Suicide Prevention Partnership Forum.\nWhen talking about suicide prevention we are helping to break down the barriers or stigma around suicide. The experts believe suicide can be prevented with the right interventions.\nOur new local strategy is based on the 8 national strategic priorities (below) detailed within the national strategy.\n- Improving data and evidence\n- Tailored, targeted support to priority groups\n- Addressing common risk factors at a population level\n- Promoting online safety and responsible media content to reduce harms\n- Providing effective crisis support across sections\n- Reducing access to means and methods of suicide\n- Providing effective bereavement support to those affected by suicide\n- Making suicide everybody’s business\nAn event called Walk for a Life has been organised to remember those we have lost to suicide, raise awareness, and encourage and empower people in Somerset to take action to prevent suicide.\nA Walk for a Life is on Sept 7th, Walk start time: 10.30am, meeting House, Bath Place, Taunton, Somerset, TA1 4EP.\nTraining we can do includes: Every Life Matters and Orange button Community Awareness Scheme.\nThere will be continuing annual updates to the Adults and Health Scrutiny committee evaluating the local suicide prevention strategy.\nSomerset Council is calling out to anyone who has recently planted or plans to plant trees, to add them to the Somerset Tree Planting Register.\nAs part of the 10-year Somerset Tree Strategy launched last June, developed with partners like the Woodland Trust and the Environment Agency, the goal is to plant 240 hectares (93 square miles) of new trees across Somerset each year until 2033 to get the county’s tree coverage to at least the national average.\nThe Somerset Tree Planting Register will help us track these important tree-planting goals.\nFurther details can be found here: https://somersetcouncil.citizenspace.com/climate-and-environment/woodland-creation-engagement-survey/\nReport it first: useful Links to share with your communities\nVisit Report a problem on the road: https://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/report-a-problem-on-the-road/\nFor traffic updates and roadworks follow @travelsomerset on X and Facebook.\nSign-up for the latest climate news:\nhttps://www.somerset.gov.uk/environment-and-food-safety/climate-and-ecological-emergency/newsletter-sign-up/.\nLive travel information\nhttps://www.travelsomerset.co.uk/\nPotholes and road damage\nSomerset Council repair potholes and other road defects, and maintain our roads, for the safe access of all road users:\nhttps://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/potholes-and-road-damage/\nReport a problem with a street light\nWe maintain and repair street lights to national standards to provide safe access to all road users:\nhttps://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/report-a-problem-with-a-street-light/\nRoads, travel and parking, road signs, markings and lighting\nIncludes information about non-illuminated bollards, pedestrian crossings, requesting a village nameplate and how to apply for a new road sign Speed limits:https://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/road-signs-bollards-and-road-markings/\nSpeed limits\nRequest information about new or existing traffic calming measures:\nhttps://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/speed-limits/\nTraffic lights\nWe maintain over 200 traffic light locations throughout the county\nhttps://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/traffic-lights/\nStreet and roadworks\nWe maintain the roads and pavements that are managed at public expense in Somerset\nhttps://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/street-and-roadworks/",

He also declined an invitation to attend the NFU hustings on June 27, which was yesterday also cancelled.\nIt means the Labour candidate has not attended a single hustings event during the campaign, depriving constituents in Bridgwater, Burnham and Highbridge the opportunity to scrutinise his views and Labour policies.\nHis disappointing absence from hustings events prompted Claire Sully to invite the Labour candidate to put forward three dates and times that he would be available for a debate, writing to each candidate with her proposal on Saturday, June 22.\nHowever, the Labour candidate’s refusal on June 26 has put an end to any hope of a debate on all policies which includes Labour.\nWhile the Labour candidate is nowhere to be seen, Claire Sully has been a prominent figure during the campaign, meeting residents, getting involved in community projects, accepting every hustings invitation and standing up to scrutiny.\n“The Labour candidate’s refusal to engage in a debate during this campaign is disappointing but predictable,” said Claire.\n“He has avoided scrutiny at every turn. I think he’s let down the residents of Bridgwater, Burnham, Highbridge and North Petherton by being absent from hustings during this campaign, depriving constituents of an opportunity to question him on his views and policies. If he cannot or will not stand up to and challenge the Conservatives, then I will.\n“But this is reflective of Labour’s campaign more generally in Somerset. This week it was confirmed by the Financial Times that Labour were abandoning Bridgwater in favour of Plymouth, effectively admitting that they cannot challenge the Tories in Bridgwater, while the Lib Dems can.\n“I have engaged with a wide range of communities from right across the constituency, and it’s been incredible to meet such amazing people doing wonderful things to better communities.\n“As an MP, I will be visible and accessible to all, and not hide away like Leigh Redman and the current Tory MP for Bridgwater.\n“The Lib Dems are on the surge in Bridgwater and across Somerset, making the election in Bridgwater a shoot-out between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives. You can join the surge and vote Claire Sully and the Liberal Democrats on July 4.”\nGo Claire. You really are a driving force. Keep up the good work. Xx\nThank you 🙂",

  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_electoral-registration-down-as-tory-britain-faces-democratic-crisis/content_98.html": "Electoral registration down as Tory Britain faces democratic crisis\nMore than 12,000 potential voters within Bridgwater Constituency are missing from the electoral register, a vast number which could have significant implications for the anticipated General Election later this year and creates a damning indictment as to the health of democracy in the UK under the Conservatives.\nAccording to research released on February 7th by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), a staggering 7.6 million eligible voters are estimated to be missing on the electoral register from across England and Wales, with 12,088 eligible voters across Bridgwater, Burnham, Highbridge and the surrounding areas not registered, the latter figure equivalent to more than 15% of the electorate in the constituency.\nSuch a large number of missing potential voters, who as it stands will have no voice at the upcoming election, puts at threat the highly esteemed democratic processes in the UK. Voter apathy and alienation has become widespread under the 14-year rule of the Conservatives, with politicians now elected while a significant amount of the population is absent from the UK electoral roll.\nWorryingly, the recent trend is for these figures to have been on the increase, with the total number of registered voters in 2022 having declined by 0.7%, or 345,818, when compared with the number of registered voters in 2017.\nThe Conservative-implemented new voter ID rules, which require all registered voters to have a form of photographic identification in order to vote, is likely to only exacerbate the stark rise in missing voters. This year’s General Election will be the first conducted under the new criteria, with the majority of those not possessing ID being younger or from more deprived backgrounds, and therefore less likely to have the required identification, such as a driver’s licence.\nFurthermore, having been driven to financial peril by the Conservative government, cash-strapped local councils that are responsible for registering new voters are also struggling to facilitate the process of voter registration.\nAs a result, the ERS holds concerns over the prospects of institutions being able to cope with new voter registrations as the ERS and other organisations begin their registration drives ahead of the anticipated General Election.\n“Whilst the effort to register voters [in 2019] was a huge success, this volume (2.3 million registrations between October 29 and November 26, 2019) put huge pressure on Electoral Registration Officers to process all these applications,” the ERS release said.\nBridgwater parliamentary candidate Claire Sully and the Liberal Democrats believe an election should be called immediately to enable the country to restore confidence in its ailing democracy, one of many issues prevalent to voters.\n“These figures are hugely worrying but unfortunately they are reflective of the state of our democracy under Conservative rule,” Claire said.\n“Britain is having its fundamental democratic principles eroded by a Conservative Party that desperately attempts to cling to power.\n“The Conservatives have eroded our democratic institutions and principles under the mantra of self-preservation. A General Election needs to be called now so that the country can elect better MPs and install a new government to clear up the mess of 14 years of Conservative rule.\n“I’m passionate that politics should be about representing people – not dictating to them. The Liberal Democrats offer a community-based approach that values the views of each individual and seeks to make our Country more democratic, not less.\n“The Conservatives need to be removed and Labour knows it can’t win here.

Thank you to the other candidates who took part. It was clear that the young people, as students at the school, learned an enormous amount from each MP candidate present. Politicians need to engage with young people at every opportunity. The decisions we make today will affect their lives as they grow up.\nI accepted the invitation to participate in the Churches Together and LGBTQ+ hustings in Burnham-On-Sea and Highbridge, respectively. Churches Together run election hustings across Somerset and they have run them before in Burnham-on-Sea. It was extremely disappointing to have both these events cancelled due to declining of invitations from candidates, including the Labour candidate.\nLeigh Redman has made a deliberate decision to not attend any hustings. This has significantly played a part in there being no hustings in Burnham and Highbridge (a significant proportion of the new Bridgwater constituency). Instead of being honest about this and standing up to scrutiny, Leigh Redman is deflecting away from his absence to attack me – just me – even though it is his deliberate actions and his choice to not attend. The other candidates have also publicly spoken about his absence, but it’s only me that he has decided to attack. I expected more from Leigh.\nIf Leigh Redman was a serious candidate to be the next MP for Bridgwater, he would stand up to scrutiny. He has had ample opportunity to do so. Instead, Leigh’s attitude is to evade questions from the electorate, indicating that he would be another absent MP that residents have become accustomed to for the last 23 years.\nEqually Redman did not answer any of my questions after knocking on my door!

  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_council-tax-decision-explained/content_22.html": "Council Tax Decision Explained\nSomerset Council Leader Bill Revans has reiterated calls for expedited reform of local government funding by the Government, as councillors voted on a balanced budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year during the Full Council meeting on March 5th.\nAs part of the budget proposal, the Government has authorised Somerset Council to increase Council Tax by 2.5% above the usual 5% cap, acknowledging the Council’s unique situation.\nSomerset’s Council Tax levels are below the national average, a situation exacerbated by the previous (Conservative) ruling group’s six-year freeze on Council Tax. Somerset is also the largest unitary authority in the country, impacting service delivery costs.\nAround 66% of Council Tax revenue is allocated to Social Care and Children’s Services, sectors experiencing increasing demand and rising costs.\nAcknowledging the financial strain many residents face due to rising inflation and utility costs, the Liberal Democrat-led Somerset Council chose to maintain support for the Council Tax assistance scheme.\nSomerset’s financial difficulties are part of a national problem. One in four councils in England say they are likely to apply for emergency government bailout agreements to stave off bankruptcy in the next two financial years (2025/26 and 2026/27), according to a stark survey by the LGA.\nThe opposition parties at Somerset Council offered no alternatives and voted against the budget. Not supporting the budget could have resulted in a section 114 notice for Somerset Council, leading to a double-digit Council Tax rise, a sell-off of more assets, halting essential capital projects, and cuts to frontline services. In this scenario, Government commissioners would run the Council, leaving local people with very little say on decisions affecting their lives.\nDespite current challenges, Somerset’s Council Tax remains lower than that of Wiltshire, Dorset, and Cornwall. Following a resident consultation, 52% of respondents supported an increase in Council Tax to match the national average to protect essential services.\nEstablished in April 2023, the new Unitary Authority for Somerset has balanced its budget every year since its formation while declaring a financial emergency and calling for local government finance reform.\nIf you need help, please see below:\n- Apply for a reduction in your Council Tax bill here: Claim Council Tax Reduction\n- Apply to the Council’s Hardship Fund here: Claim a Discretionary Award\nFinancial documents, including Revenue and Capital Budgets and the Medium Term Financial Strategy from 2025-26 to 2029-30, can be found online at: Somerset Council Budgets.

  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_frome-sowing-seeds-and-seeing-transformation-in-a-somerset-town/content_176.html": "Frome – sowing seeds and seeing transformation in a Somerset town.\nIn 2008 I was asked to present ideas for place marketing to the Catherine Hill Traders, who were a group of business owners based on and around Catherine Hill, in Frome.\nAt this time Catherine Hill had few thriving businesses, while it did have something special: people with great ideas prepared to come together and make something good happen.\nFollowing this Frome’s “place brand” vision spreading across the town, gaining incredible buy-in from the wider community. This brand is now recognisable throughout the UK. Regularly tens of thousands of people visit Catherine Hill to experience the Artisan Market (now renamed: The Frome Independent). These days Frome is seen as a destination shopping area and much more!\nWhat I believe is key is learning from success. I’ve still got the report I sent the Catherine Hill Traders and the steps we recommended they take, which they followed.\nExtracts from a handout I presented in April 2008 are as follows:\nHow to sell my town (By Claire Sully, 2008).\nWhy Place Marketing?\nPlace marketing is all about people – exciting, enthusing and attracting them to any one place. This is not only about attracting new people to a place, but also engaging with local people and internal investors.\nThe starting point for marketing your town is to create a positive perception in the eyes of your target audience and ensuring the reality meets those perceptions.\nTo define the question more clearly – why place marketing for Catherine Hill?\nWe suggest: Catherine Hill has a combination of advantages and disadvantages that make it an ideal location for place marketing.\nSome of its disadvantages are immediately obvious – it’s called a Hill for a reason – its location gives it an immediate geographical disadvantage compared to its more obvious “competitors”, Cheap Street for independent shopping and the high street for clothes, toys etc.\nPeople need a reason to go to Catherine Hill – and any place marketing project needs to be based around creating this reason.\nHowever, the advantages it has – while less obvious – are very strong. In fact it has the two things that are absolutely essential to successful place marketing – partnership and a genuine sense of place.\nMarketing can ultimately only work if it is selling a reality – and that reality needs to meet the needs of the people it is being sold to.\nThe reality of Catherine Hill is that it has a lot to sell. Independent shops and cafés, its architecture, the sense of a “destination” rather than just a clone high street;\nAnd it has the partnership – the Catherine Hill Traders Association, arts and community groups.\nMarketing a place is not just about talking to external customers, its about ensuring the internal partners have a collective vision of what the place should be and work together to ensure that the message being sent to external customers reflects the reality of what is happening on the ground.\nHow Place Marketing Works\nHow does place marketing work? To begin with you need to have a shared vision, ensure you work with a wide range of different partners and interested bodies and have an effective and long term marketing strategy, involving both on-line (web) and off-line (more traditional marketing methods other than web).\nVision:\nThe people who live and work in a place – all of the people – are the ones who define the image of the place – or at least acknowledge and agree to it.\nThat image won’t work if it is a short-lived marketing generated image – it needs to be a sustainable positive perception of the place generated by the people in that place.\nIf any place marketing campaign is to be successful, it needs you – the people who define the place – to be ambassadors for the brand.\nDefine what your offering is – then ensure that you carry that definition through in all your marketing – from your own advertising to the way you interact with your customers and your Catherine Hill partners.\nPartnerships:\nYou can find a successful example of this in Cardiff. Cardiff has a number of Victorian arcades which suffered from some of the same geographical disadvantages as Catherine Hill – they were somewhere you had to go to, rather than somewhere you naturally went, and they were mainly occupied by small independent traders.\nMost people who went shopping in Cardiff stuck to the high street, or the big department stores.\nThe arcade owners got together, and created a partnership which worked with the local tourist board, local authorities and business organisations to actively promote the arcades as “shopping destinations” – making a virtue of their independence, their architecture, their sense of destination.\nThey came up with a brand for the arcades which was sold on by everyone – if you picked up a bag from one of the shops, as well as its own logo it would have the Cardiff Arcades logo – if you bought clothes in one store, they would recommend accessories in another, or tell you where you could get a great cup of coffee.\nThe result is that the arcades are now some of the most popular shopping streets in Cardiff, and some of the stores are now as well known as department stores that they were failing to compete against previously.\nWhere the Cardiff Arcades succeeded was in not narrowing their place marketing down to just themselves – their success came out of being part of a larger offering, tying in with and feeding the overall marketing of Cardiff as it moved from being a capital in name only to being the international city it is today – they positioned themselves as one of the shopping “crown jewels” of a city being sold as a whole as it repositioned itself in its role as the centre of a resurgent Welsh economy.\nSimilarly, Catherine Hill can only really sell itself as an important part of an overall offering of Frome, Mendip – even Somerset.\nFrome has a lot of selling points which, at the moment, aren’t being sold. It has a visible history of artisan excellence which is carried through to today with its diverse range of world-class jewellers, glassmakers, artists etc.\nWe would encourage you to engage in any place marketing scheme with other businesses in Frome, with Vision for Frome, with the tourist board, Mendip District Council, Mendip Business Life etc to at least begin a repositioning of Frome based on its real competitive advantage – of which you are a part.\nLessons from Birmingham\nFrome has a lot in common with an area which provides one of the most successful examples of modern place marketing – Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter.\nLike Frome, the Hockley area of Birmingham had a history of quality artisanship, and a number of existing businesses based around the historic skills in the area.\nHockley had declined dramatically up until the 1980s, and also suffered from being part of an overall brand – Birmingham – that did not have a great tourist appeal.\nThe businesses in the area recognised that they had an offering – just as you have – that had not only a reality behind it (the genuine quality of work and the history of the place) but also a real market value – high quality, prestige goods which appealed to a demographic with high disposable income.\nWorking in partnership with Birmingham City Council, the British Jewellers Association, Business Link and other public and private bodies, they re-branded the area by resurrecting its old name as “The Jewellery Quarter”.\nThe businesses tied themselves in with the tourist attractions – the museums, the historic walks, the galleries – to make themselves part of the overall offering.\nWhat the businesses did was to let everyone know they were “The Jewellery Quarter” – from brown Heritage signs saying that, to incorporating the brand into their branding.\nBecause it was a reality they were selling, telling enough people enough times that they were “The Jewellery Quarter” made sure that that is what they became. Now the Jewellery Quarter is not so much a brand as a place name, and the area attracts not only substantial national and international tourism, but more and more high quality businesses who want to be associated with the brand, not just jewellery shops but cafes, restaurants, clothes shops and more.\nCo-ordinated and long term marketing\nCo-ordinating your marketing can help you reach more of your target customers as well as save you costs.\nThe web is one very important way of reaching a local, national and international audience. Most businesses now recognise the power of the web as an advertising and marketing tool and will have a website.\nThe beauty of the web is its inherent ability to work with cross-marketing – one of the key strategies for place marketing.\nPromoting your brand via the web gives you the ability to promote the individual brands within the overall offering – and on the other side to easily link up with other larger partners, business and tourist websites, Mendip Business Life, Visit Somerset etc.\nTo reinforce the place proposition (vision/brand etc) it is essential to tie up your PR, events, advertising and web marketing – a website plays a centre role to this.\n[…] and produce market in North Petherton.

A saltmarsh that would have destroyed aquatic eco-systems and natural habitat, wildlife homes, as well as ancient farmland, businesses and valued community space for local people and school children.\nEDF have listened, backed down and changed their plan. Today myself, Pawlett Hams Action Group and others received this e-mail:\n“I have some important news for you regarding our proposal for a new Saltmarsh at Pawlett Hams.\n“After completing a full review of the consultation, we have decided to pause all work on our proposal for the creation of new habitat in the local area. As an alternative to the proposed area at Pawlett, we will instead be beginning to consider other potential sites across the wider Severn Estuary. I will be able to provide you an update on these areas soon once we have begun wider local discussions with stakeholders close by, although none of the sites are within the Somerset Council boundary.”\nThis has been a joy of a community campaign, which I’ve been involved in since the beginning, to help the community become a strong voice working collectively and creatively. The campaign at its heart was about celebrating a beloved ancient landscape with the community coming together to “run the hams”, “snap the hams” (photo competition), to meetup to record the local nature on wildlife survey aps. This decision from EDF is a win win!\nThank you for your support in this Claire – call me sceptical but I’d like to see them change the word “pause” to “abandon” before I crack open the champagne. It could yet come back if the alternative sites they are looking at are not viable for whatever reason. It could just prolong the agony of living under the threat of CPO but hopefully they will decide what their preferred option is sooner rather than later and obtain consent for it, which will be the real deciding factor. Obviously other people, somewhere, will now soon be under the threat of CPO and loss of their land and livelihoods as we were, so I guess our celebrations are tinged with sadness for those who will next be in the firing line.\nHi Anne, I do think it’s unlikely that EDF will want to revisit Pawlett Hams as part of their mitigation plans.

I have made it one of my priority areas, since being elected in May 2022, to investigate the issues and find solutions. I have met with local residents, consulted with the police, Somerset Highways and Evercreech Parish Council repeatedly. My thoughts are with local people, their families and friends, who have been impacted by incidents at this corner.\nAt the beginning of the year we installed roadside monitoring rings to gather data and track car speeds along the A371, from the Bath and West Showground southwards through Pecking Mill and Southwood to the junction of Wyke Champflower.\nBased on the results Somerset Highways and the Police have agreed to extend the existing 40mph.\nA Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) has now been issued and is being advertised, in line with The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.\nSubject to no objections being received the aim is to have the extended speed limit scheme in place around October 2023.\nIt has also been proposed to be included in the 2024 / 2025 surface dressing programme, which should improve the skid resistance of the road surface in the longer term.\nAs this work won’t be completed until next financial year, in the interim, the Area Highways team are also organising for the existing surface to be retextured to restore the skid resistance, and help to reduce the risk of collisions occurring, alongside of the planned speed limit reduction.\nAs well as remedial action to the road surface, regarding the ongoing concerns over camber/alignment on the corner the highways team are continuing to look at this further, although this assessment will take a bit longer.\nI am continuing to speak to the Parish Council and Somerset Highways about installing a Speed Indicator Device on the bend. But such devices are usually not used as a permanent solution.\nI will continue to work with the police, Somerset Highways, Evercreech Parish Council and support local residents.\nWhile I appreciate the efforts being made by everyone concerned, no amount of extended speed limits will stop people driving too fast on this bend.\nThe camber is obviously an issue and shoul be addressed first.\nSpeed limits are not the answer.\nThere is an area of scrubby hedge on the left hand side of the road just above and opposite the Pecking Mill junction. This impedes clear vision around the bend for people crossing to the right onto Pecking Mill Lane\nIt should be completely removed because it is not managed\nHi Carole\nI’ve reported this. Thank you for letting me know.\nClaire Sully\nGreat news.\nI also have theory as to why on the Pecking Mill Inn side of the road vehicles run into the Stone shed/wall.\nThe white lines on the bend outer side do not follow the road as they end.So if you are following the lines they will guide you towards the stone structure.,I can take pictures if you need to see my meaning.\nHi Sam\nThank you for your feedback on this, will mention this to the Highways Officers.",

This compares to a total of 2,579 parcels distributed by Trussell Trust food banks in Sedgemoor in the corresponding period in 2018.\nClaire Sully, the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the new Bridgwater constituency, said the latest figures amounted to ‘an abject failure of the Conservative government to adequately ensure the most basic wellbeing of residents from across the new Bridgwater constituency and the UK’.\n“These shocking figures of rising emergency food bank use in Sedgemoor, which have grown exponentially under the Tory-manufactured cost-of-living crisis in recent years, demonstrate just how much the Conservatives have failed to care for those of all backgrounds in the new Bridgwater constituency and beyond,” Claire said.\n“It should not be the role of charity to ensure people can meet their most basic food requirement. It is becoming an ever-more drastic situation which requires immediate solutions and support, both of which have been so woefully lacking from the Conservatives.\n“The King’s Speech, announced last Tuesday, contained nothing which will address this desperate situation. The Conservatives are out of ideas and out of time to address the issue of cost of living.”\nThe damning report revealed that a shocking 1.5 million emergency food parcels had been handed out to families within the Trussell Trust network so far this year across the whole of the UK, more than in any previous year, and represents a 16% rise to the figures released in 2022, with the Trust’s report describing food banks to be at ‘breaking point’.\nOf people in the UK who received food parcels this year, the research shows that a staggering 65% were families with children.\nWhile the risk to the most vulnerable residents within the new Bridgwater constituency remains at an all-time high, the Tory cost-of-living crisis is now significantly impacting those with livelihoods traditionally perceived as stable, as well as the elderly and those with special needs.\nClaire Sully last week met with an employee of an NHS general practice in the new Bridgwater constituency, who described the desperate situation of some of their most vulnerable patients, as well as NHS colleagues who had required the use of food banks to meet their daily needs, their situation a direct cause of the worsening cost-of-living crisis.\n“We’re struggling to get food for those who don’t fit the classic demographics,” said the NHS worker, who requested to remain anonymous. “We’re having people with learning difficulties needing to go to food banks to get food. There are elderly patients, those in their 80s and 90s, whose pensions are not reaching their day-to-day needs having to reach out to food banks. Even medical practice employees and nurses at our surgery have had to reach out to food banks to meet their daily needs, simply because their wages, which are above the minimum, don’t stretch to meet their requirements.”",

I am bringing both sides together to see if this might unlock a solution and a way forward for both EDF and the local community.\nHow do the other nuclear power stations cooling water intakes on the Severn estuary avoid killing fish and other marine animals?\nTo opt for a cheap untested solution in the first place only to retrospectively decide to abandon it really means that a totally new design for fish preservation at water intakes is needed. I expect that EDF commissioned some design options prior to choosing AFD. Its cavalier approach to animal life and environmental damage is alarming to witness in an industry that manages potentially lethal material.\nReading the EDF report I note that the company has not presented costed ameliorations to the risk that it identified with the Acoustic Fish Deterrent. Which is to say the AFD can work but the financial cost of maintaining it has not been fully explored or disclosed.\nThe cost to the habitat and its food web, if AFD is not implemented, is based on crude estimates and has been not been accurately modelled or measured in terms of all the species and numbers destroyed and left to rot and pollute the estuary. The vast cost to habitat, if AFD is not implemented, is indicated by the proposed huge offset at Pawlett Hams – unfortunately an ignorant proposal that would decimate vulnerable species and is contrary to Somerset’s Biodiversity Net Gain rules and Local Nature Recovery Strategy.",

The surgeries at greatest risk of closure are smaller medical practices on lower funding in the most deprived areas. After consulting with staff at local medical centres she believes some could be at risk of closure.\nSeveral GP medical practices in the constituency are facing unprecedented pressures. These include East Quay Medical Centre in Bridgwater, as well as medical practices in North Petherton, Burnham and East Brent, while the Victoria Park GP surgery in Bridgwater closed permanently in August 2021 due to ‘clinical staff shortages’. Local medical services are under extreme pressures due to the Conservative government’s failure to adequately resource these vital facilities, with local residents in the Bridgwater constituency could be at risk of losing their GP surgery.\nAt the core of our broken NHS system is its undervalued workforce, which continues to be further stretched due to Conservative government cuts, resulting in the number of fully trained, full-time equivalent GPs in England to have reduced by more than 2,000 since 2015.\nClaire will embark on 2.5km run (or optional 5K return loop) departing from Somerset Bridge Medical Centre, at 10.30am on Saturday, December 9th, in support and recognition of the vital services that GP surgeries provide right across the new Bridgwater constituency.\n“The Conservatives have pushed primary care services and GP surgeries to the brink,” said Claire.\n“These services are of vital importance not only to those who rely on accessing them, but also to those hardworking people that work there, who have been grossly neglected resulting in a severe worsening of pay and conditions.\n“We need to value our NHS staff, improve working conditions and, in turn, make for the very best possible services we can provide to local residents.\n“I hope many will join me on the run and show their support for our brilliant NHS workers.”\nEmotional ‘Run for Bethany’ well supported\nClaire’s ‘Running the Constituency’ challenge began on Saturday, December 2, with a run organised in memory of Bethany Branson, who, aged 19, tragically died in a road collision in November last year.\nStarting at Haygrove School in Bridgwater, Claire and Bethany’s parents Ben and Amy, were joined by the local community, friends and family, completed the 5km route. Their aim was to raise awareness of road safety and drink driving in the hope no further families need endure the harrowing loss experienced by Amy and Ben.\nThose wishing to keep up-to-date with Claire’s running challenge, as she raises awareness of issues that affect local people in the new Bridgwater constituency, can do so by following her Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ClaireSullyPC/) or through her website (https://clairesully.com/).",

This was also when I met Teddy and Sos and learned of the terrible circumstances they were living in, due to cruel Government legislation around Sossa’s visa status (she is a US citizen).\nSince then we have taken their visa application nightmare to the national press, had a dialogue with the Home Office, and set up a gofundme page.\nSadly they remain stuck in a system where Sossa dying is part of the outcomes the Conservative Government’s immigration policies seems to accept.\nThere are three strands to this story, that make it particularly tragic:\n- Sossa is waiting for a life-saving operation because of kidney failure, her husband Teddy is giving up a kidney to a donor pool to expediate Sossa’s transplant operation. There is no date for either operation, at the time of writing this.\n- Financial support for the family, such as 30 hours childcare and carer allowances, is refused even though the family is eligible. This is simply down to Sossa’s visa status, where the word entitlement overrides eligibility. As an American citizen, Sossa is not eligible for disability benefits, and Teddy cannot claim carers’ allowance because Sossa is not receiving disability benefits The family is disqualified for the 30 hours free childcare because of Sossa’s status. Teddy would work, if vital care was available for his wife. Meaning Sossa could safely be with someone 24/7 in case of seizures (side effects of Sossa’s renal failure include seizures, gout, & worse).\n- Sossa’s permanent Visa application process deadline is September 2023, this is likely to be refused because the family don’t meet the minimum financial criterial because of above points. Teddy and Sossa have been together for 10 years, married for 6 years and have have a young 5 year old.\nTeddy told me today that “no one wants to have a human conversation about our situation”. After rent the family have £385 to survive, they rely on foodbanks to eat. Sossa and Teddy will struggle to pay for Sossa’s visa application and all the costs associated with that.\nI have helped this family with fundraising and I am continuing to press the Government and grab as much media attention to raise awareness of their situation.",

The Conservatives promised to bring down immigration, but they have woefully failed.\n97% of immigration is, in fact, legal. This goes to show that, despite Brexit, it is Conservative policy which has proven a failure.\nPeople coming over on boats is an issue. It’s heartbreaking that asylum seekers, including children, are losing their lives. For genuine cases, we need to treat people with compassion and speed up the processing. Lib Dems plan to significantly speed up the time people wait for asylum decisions. In Somerset there is currently no asylum advice legal professionals based here. This adds to the delays.\nThe government’s Rwanda policy is a complete waste of more than 500 million pounds of taxpayers’ money, to remove just 300 people. Is that value? It’s simply bad policy.\nThe Lib Dems will instead use that money to go after the people smugglers. We will set up a new unit of border enforcement and invest in training and tech that will help prevent people getting into the boats in the first place.\nTo bring down immigration, we should prioritise those we need for crucial sectors that rely heavily on migrants, such as social care and the NHS, and encourage better conditions and pay for British workers to fill those roles. Conservatives have cut budgets for workforce development, making this process difficult.\nThe immigration crisis is a result of Conservative failure to adequately invest in public services. It is why people struggle to see a doctor, a dentist and buy or rent a home.\nOnly the Lib Dem manifesto has the vision, ambition and deliverability to solve the problems our country faces.\nThe Lib Dems are offering the top seven most popular policies, according to a recent poll. At this election, we need more Lib Dem MPs to hold the next Government to account and bring through our policies, to deliver a brighter future for Britain.",

Tooth decay is the most common reason for hospital admission in children, with more than 4.5 million children not visiting a dentist last year.\nIn a recent poll for the British Dental Association, dentistry topped the list of NHS services which are hardest to reach, with 80% of respondents saying the government should do more to improve it.\nThe Liberal Democrats have a wide-ranging plan to improve dental health in Bridgwater and the UK, including a policy to cut VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste. This policy, according to a YouGov poll, is among the three most popular policies released by parties so far – with all three policies from the Liberal Democrats.\nThe Liberal Democrats will also guarantee that everyone can access a dentist for emergency treatment, ending DIY dentistry and ‘dentist deserts’.\nLiberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, Claire Sully, said the news will provide welcome relief for people in Bridgwater, who have struggled to access NHS dental care, but she says much more needs to be done.\n“I’m delighted there will be a new dentist surgery in Bridgwater. It will come as a relief to many who have found access to dentist treatment near impossible under this Conservative government,” Claire said.\n“The Liberal Democrats have a plan to fix dentistry and save the NHS. From cutting VAT on children’s toothpaste and toothbrushes, to guaranteeing everyone can access emergency dental treatment, the Liberal Democrats will end the need for DIY dentistry and bring back local NHS dentist surgeries lost under the Conservatives.”\nIn Bridgwater, the Liberal Democrats are best placed to defeat the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats can beat the Tories into second place at this election, but seats like Bridgwater are crucial to win for the Lib Dems.\nWell done, NHS dental services are much needed in Bridgwater as in the rest of the country.\nHi Claire\nDoes ‘affordable’ dentist mean NHS?

However, Symphony Healthcare Services, an NHS contractor operating GP surgeries primarily in Somerset and Devon, have conceded that the “funds are not available” and that there are “no other ‘pots’ to call upon” to implement the much needed pay increase for staff.\nDespite this broken promise, announced over Christmas, Rishi Sunak stated on BBC Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg (7/1/2024), stating that all NHS pay disputes were resolved, apart from the current Junior Doctors strikes.\nSymphony, who operate Burnham and Berrow Medical Centre, Highbridge Medical Centre and North Petherton Surgery, have said they will not be able to offer the promised 6% increase to many of its staff due to a lack of funding from the government, accusing them of ‘ambiguous’ messaging when the pay increase was first announced in July 2023.\nIn a communication to staff on December 14, 2023, Symphony Healthcare Services said: “In October 2023, the details of the increase in funding were clarified and it was apparent that the July communication was somewhat ambiguous. All avenues to fund the shortfall have been explored but regrettably the organisation cannot afford to make any further pay increases – the funds are simply not available and there are no other ‘pots’ to call upon.”\nSymphony handed its workers a minimum 2.5% pay increase in April 2023 which, in many instances, ensured staff would not fall below the National Minimum Wage threshold in England. The latest revelations are yet another setback for NHS workers, who have been once again let down by the Conservative government reneging on its promises.\nSymphony said that in the subsequent details released by government in October on how the promised 6% pay increase would be met, the ‘additional funding’ included the increase in funding that was provided in April 2023.\nThe update from Symphony to its staff added: “This meant that the total increase in funding only just covered the pay increases that had already been passed on in April. Furthermore, once the contractual 6% pay increase to GPs in factored in, Symphony has used up more than the additional funding provided.”\nClaire Sully, the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the new Bridgwater Constituency, has decried yet another failure of the Conservative government to follow through on pay promises made to NHS staff.\n“We cannot trust this Conservative government to deliver what it has promised on the NHS,” Claire said. “This latest failed promise wrapped in Conservative party spin will heap misery and uncertainty on many NHS staff at a time we look for optimism and comfort over Christmas and into the New Year.\n“The Conservative government is dismantling our doctors’ surgeries from the inside, through the erosion of workforce pay and conditions which has resulted in a proliferation of staff vacancies, an overstretched workforce and a lack of available appointments for patients.\n“If elected as your MP for Bridgwater, the provision of NHS services and GP surgeries will be a top priority with primary care a service which must be fixed.”\nClaire has continued to campaign for improved NHS provision and pay and conditions for its staff. Earlier this month, Claire and many supporters undertook a run from Somerset Bridge Medical Centre to East Quay Medical Centre in Bridgwater in order to highlight the severe funding issues in our NHS caused by years of Conservative neglect.",

I will discuss this with the Gravity team, as part of their local community engagement work. The decision to offer a new leisure centre which is accessible to local residents is a tangible example of what the Gravity Smart Campus can bring to those who live nearby. I am pleased that there is a plan to have a Legacy Wall in the new building to acknowledge the history and heritage of the building.”\nClaire hosted her first ‘Shine A Light On…’ event at the 37 Club on the Gravity Smart Campus site, among the speakers was Bill Revans, leader of the Somerset Council, and Claire Pearce, a director at the ground-breaking Gravity Smart Campus which is set to be a world-leader in the production of sustainable energy solutions. Tony Cradock also spoke about the excellent work (and future ambition) undertaken at the Morlands Community Hub in Highbridge.",

If the result of this election was replicated at the general election, on account of the boundary changes from Bridgwater and West Somerset to the new Bridgwater constituency alone and adjusted for size, the Liberal Democrat vote would increase by 26%. The party would represent the biggest challengers to the Conservatives, while Labour is a distant third.\nThe new boundary changes will clearly have a profound impact on what colour the Bridgwater seat turns at the next general election. And here’s why.\nThe new Bridgwater constituency will encompass 17 wards for an electorate of more than 71,000 voters. To the north of Bridgwater, the constituency has gained the notable towns of Highbridge and Burnham-On-Sea – traditionally strong Liberal Democrat areas. In the east, the rural wards of West and East Poldens that were previously in the Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency have entered the Wells constituency, while in the west a large area of the former Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency will now form part of the Tiverton and Minehead constituency.\nAs is evident from the most recent election results, the Liberal Democrats are set to be the big winners from the new boundary changes in Bridgwater, making Claire Sully the leading challenger to the Conservatives at the upcoming election!",
  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_dear-tim-lethaby-editor-of-county-gazette/content_3.html": "Dear Tim Lethaby, Editor of Somerset County Gazette\nHello Tim\nAs the editor of County Gazette, I wanted to let you know I am concerned about how your newspaper’s recent posts on Facebook appear to incite hostility towards public officials like myself.\nThere have been two specific posts regarding the remuneration of Councillors and MPs that lack context and balance. The resulting comments have been negative, hurtful, and misinformed, and I’ve even noticed suggestions of threats directed towards individuals in public service, like me.\nTo provide some context, Somerset Council has significantly cut expenditure on Councillor allowances by £520,000 and expenses by £44,000 by reducing the number of Councillors from 267 to 110, with a further decrease to 96 anticipated by 2027. Despite having fewer Councillors, the workload remains largely the same. Some District Councillors even experienced an allowance cut once the Unitary Authority was established in May 2023.\nYou should be aware that an independent Remuneration Panel establishes Councillors’ allowances based on hours worked, with any increases linked to national pay awards. This means Councillors do not set their own allowance, which seems to be implied by your media platform. Additionally, many Councillors opt not to claim all their allowances or expenses; in fact, I have never claimed expenses, despite all the trips I do for casework and to attend committees or Full Council in Taunton and Bridgwater.\nThe time I dedicate to my Councillor work is not compensated anywhere near my professional hourly rate given my skills and experience. And the role is very demanding and challenging. Not helped by public attacks, which your paper’s posts (on facebook) are generating.\nSome of us have faced harassment that has been serious enough to involve the police.\nMy straightforward question for you, as the editor, is whether the engagement your posts generate on Facebook is worth the negative impact they have on individuals serving in public office? I assume you are aware of the potential risks that may arise from the animosity your media platform posts can create?\nWe all want to encourage the best candidates to step forward as Councillors and MPs, but in the increasingly toxic environment your media platform seems to be contributing to, how many potential community leaders will be deterred from participating in local government?\nI’ve used this platform to reach out to you, mirroring the way your media platform is drawing attention to public figures, like me.\nThank you for considering my concerns.\nCllr Claire Sully",

The van was driven at high speed through a red light on the A38 Taunton Road before it collided with two cars that had right-of-way at a junction.\nThe van’s driver was, in January this year, sentenced to 10 years in jail after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and for failing to provide an alcohol breath specimen.\nRoad safety is an issue which concerns many from across the new Bridgwater constituency, and Bethany’s parents, Amy and Ben Branson, have launched a petition with the hope of enacting change to prevent another heartbreaking tragedy on our roads.\nThe event, which will be 5km in length, will begin next to Haygrove School, Bridgwater, at 10am on Saturday December 2, with an open invitation to join Claire, and Bethany’s family, to run or walk all or part of the route.\nClaire said: “When I read about Bethany’s tragic incident and learned what her family were looking do in her name, I wanted to get involved and see how I could help them.\n“For many people, road safety is a real priority. If we think about Bethany, and the circumstances surrounding her death, it may prevent people getting in their cars after drinking alcohol, which is especially important at this time of year, as we head into the festive period.\n“I’m excited to take on this challenge and meet many residents of our wonderful constituency, while the runs will also aim to highlight important issues which are a priority to local people.\n“I very much welcome all of those interested to join me and to share with me their priorities. There will be plenty of walking as well, so you do not have to be an experienced runner to get involved.”\nThose interested in joining Claire as she ‘runs the new Bridgwater constituency’ can register their interest through the Facebook event page, or by contacting Claire at contactclairesully@gmail.com.\nDetails of further events as Claire ‘runs the new Bridgwater constituency’ will be released in due course, with information made available via her Facebook page, Strava and her website.\nClaire Sully is ‘running the new Bridgwater Constituency’\nRun 1 – in memory of Bethany Branson\nWhen: Saturday, December 2, 10.30am\nWhere: Haygrove School\nRoute: Run 1 map , you can also sign up and find more info here.",

The surgeries at greatest risk of closure are smaller medical practices on lower funding in the most deprived areas. After consulting with staff at local medical centres she believes some could be at risk of closure.\nSeveral GP medical practices in the constituency are facing unprecedented pressures. These include East Quay Medical Centre in Bridgwater, as well as medical practices in North Petherton, Burnham and East Brent, while the Victoria Park GP surgery in Bridgwater closed permanently in August 2021 due to ‘clinical staff shortages’. Local medical services are under extreme pressures due to the Conservative government’s failure to adequately resource these vital facilities, with local residents in the Bridgwater constituency could be at risk of losing their GP surgery.\nAt the core of our broken NHS system is its undervalued workforce, which continues to be further stretched due to Conservative government cuts, resulting in the number of fully trained, full-time equivalent GPs in England to have reduced by more than 2,000 since 2015.\nClaire will embark on 2.5km run (or optional 5K return loop) departing from Somerset Bridge Medical Centre, at 10.30am on Saturday, December 9th, in support and recognition of the vital services that GP surgeries provide right across the new Bridgwater constituency.\n“The Conservatives have pushed primary care services and GP surgeries to the brink,” said Claire.\n“These services are of vital importance not only to those who rely on accessing them, but also to those hardworking people that work there, who have been grossly neglected resulting in a severe worsening of pay and conditions.\n“We need to value our NHS staff, improve working conditions and, in turn, make for the very best possible services we can provide to local residents.\n“I hope many will join me on the run and show their support for our brilliant NHS workers.”\nEmotional ‘Run for Bethany’ well supported\nClaire’s ‘Running the Constituency’ challenge began on Saturday, December 2, with a run organised in memory of Bethany Branson, who, aged 19, tragically died in a road collision in November last year.\nStarting at Haygrove School in Bridgwater, Claire and Bethany’s parents Ben and Amy, were joined by the local community, friends and family, completed the 5km route. Their aim was to raise awareness of road safety and drink driving in the hope no further families need endure the harrowing loss experienced by Amy and Ben.\nThose wishing to keep up-to-date with Claire’s running challenge, as she raises awareness of issues that affect local people in the new Bridgwater constituency, can do so by following her Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ClaireSullyPC/) or through her website (https://clairesully.com/).",

That said, I’m sure many will roll their eyes at the outgoing MPs, James Heappey, attempt to jump on the health bandwagon, by suggesting his own involvement helped bring this new rating about. Mr Heappey will know that the government he supports has been the single biggest obstacle to improving health services for the public, both in Burnham and beyond. In 13 years of underfunding, outsourcing, bed closures and acute unit cuts, poor recruitment and increased bureaucracy, the public of the Burnham area has been forced to suffer longer waits to see medical practitioners, both for GP and hospital appointments, as well as reduced critical care response times and often chaotic conditions in hospitals and A&E centres.

Here are a few reasons why we have such optimism, and every offer of help will get us one step closer to achieving this.\nThe Liberal Democrats are the main challengers to the Conservatives in Bridgwater, and we are closing the gap fast.\nThe new boundary changes for Bridgwater, replacing the old Bridgwater and West Somerset seat, have resulted in notable and tangible demographic changes. The constituency now possesses the strong Liberal Democrat areas of Burnham-On-Sea and Highbridge, while relinquishing villages to the west of Bridgwater which were traditional Conservative strongholds.\nIf the results of the most recent 2022 Somerset Council elections are considered for votes cast within the new Bridgwater constituency, we find the following distribution of votes;\nConservatives 19,541\nLiberal Democrat 15,006\nLabour 7,052\nGreen 791\nIn addition, the influential Tactical.vote website has recommended tactical voters support the Liberal Democrats in Bridgwater at the 2024 General Election. They have updated their calculation to consider the new constituent boundaries, and have determined a notional 2019 election result that places the Liberal Democrats in second position behind the Conservatives, with Labour in third. See: https://tactical.vote/bridgwater/\nThe most accurate seat-by-seat poll in predicting the 2017 General Election was YouGov’s MRP poll. This poll when last released in March 2024 has just four percentage points separating the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour. In the three months from January to March, it predicted the Liberal Democrat vote to have risen by three percentage points, the Conservative vote to have decreased by five percentage points and Labour vote to have fallen by two percentage points. If the same trends occur in the next six weeks, the Liberal Democrats will win the 2024 General Election in Bridgwater.\nThe voting data for the new Bridgwater seat from the 2022 local elections is reflective of a wider trend across Somerset. The Liberal Democrats claimed a majority on Somerset Council at the 2022 local elections (61 of 110 seats) and have resoundingly defeated the Conservatives in gaining the parliamentary seat of Glastonbury & Somerton in a 2023 by-election, while the nearby seat of Tiverton & Honiton also turned Liberal Democrat in a recent by-election.\nSo, join me!

The implementation of policies to combat the climate emergency has to be now and it needs to be profound.\nFor many, policies on climate change and the protection of our natural environment will be at the forefront in their decision to place their vote at the upcoming election.\nSo, in Bridgwater, where should you place your vote to make a meaningful impact in ensuring strong climate change policies?\nAs Liberal Democrats, we’re proud of our commitment to green policies, but you no longer need to take just our word for it.\nFriends of the Earth have evaluated the strength of green policies put forward by the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Labour and The Green Party, with a clear conclusion: the Liberal Democrats and Green Party are well clear of the pack.\nThe parties were scored marks out of ten across ten different areas of climate change and environmental policies, giving a total mark out of 100, with the Liberal Democrats ‘scoring highly’ on 68.\n“Both the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party score highly,” stated the report. “Labour hasn’t scored brilliantly in this exercise. With 51 out of 100, it’s well ahead of the Conservatives, but well behind the Liberal Democrats and The Green Party.”\nThe Liberal Democrats scored the maximum 10/10 on policies to ‘Ensure a healthy environment for all’, with Friends of the Earth commenting: “The Lib Dems have a very strong package of policy on the environment, not only tackling many of the key areas, including air quality and sewage discharge, but also bringing forward new legislation to guarantee everyone a healthy environment. Top marks.”\nIn new Bridgwater constituency, it’s set to be a close race between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, with the Lib Dems polling just 4% behind the Tories in the latest YouGov MRP poll (March 2024).\nWe should all consider climate change and environmental policies to be an important aspect of the next election, and fortunately for environmentally-conscious voters, in Claire Sully and the Liberal Democrats you can vote for a strong voice on combating climate change.\nClaire is backing the Pawlett Hams group in preventing the destruction of our natural environment and endangered eco-system, while on Sunday Claire visited the Somerset Wildlife Trust to learn more about their work in protecting our treasured natural habitats.\nA vote for Claire Sully and the Liberal Democrats in Bridgwater is a sure vote for a strong voice on the climate and environment.\nTo view the full evaluation by Friends of the Earth into each party’s green policy, click here: https://friendsoftheearth.uk/system-change/green-policies-and-general-election-who-leads-pack",
  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_does-somerset-need-a-dry-january/content_33.html": "Does Somerset Need a Dry January?\nSomerset is home to an estimated 5,202 individuals who are alcohol-dependent, with approximately 80% (around 4,000) having unmet treatment needs. While we should approach this figure with caution, national trends suggest it may actually be an underestimate. Alarmingly, alcohol-related hospital admissions in Somerset are higher than the national average, particularly among women under 40.\nOne of my key motivations for running for election to Somerset Council was to understand health issues, including mental health, within our communities. As Chair of the Adults and Health Scrutiny Committee, I have the opportunity to explore various issues that affect us by examining essential Council services impacting our daily lives. We delve into evidence, analyse data, engage with experts, and, importantly, ask critical questions.\nJust before Christmas, I attended a meeting focused on public health concerning alcohol and drug dependency in Somerset. During this meeting, I raised the concept of Dry January, knowing there is backlash against it, yet eager to understand the campaign’s motivations, results, and benefits. Concerns expressed included the impact on trade for pubs and restaurants and whether a brief pause in alcohol consumption genuinely makes a difference.\nOn January 1st, I chose to participate in Dry January to support Somerset Council’s public health campaign. The first few days of abstaining were particularly challenging, especially with many family and friends celebrating birthdays this month. We often feel the urge to uplift our spirits after the Christmas holiday season by making an effort to socialise.\nI persevered and have since moved past my doubts about completing this challenge, beginning to feel the mental health benefits. One revelation has been the impressive range of high-quality non-alcoholic drinks now available that taste just as good as their alcoholic counterparts. Has Dry January contributed to this trend, or is it a response to younger generations moving away from alcohol? Alternatively, could the health-conscious choices of baby boomers indicate a growing market for alcohol alternatives?\nAmong my favorite non-alcoholic options are Clear Head, which is brewed in Bristol and offered on draft at my local pub, The George, Croscombe. A friend of mine, also participating in Dry January, mentioned that as a wine drinker, she prefers Clear Head over non-alcoholic wine, despite typically not drinking beer! Another favorite is Guinness 0.0, which tastes remarkably similar to the original; as one friend put it, it’s practically a health drink!\nAnother rewarding aspect of Dry January has been the support I’ve received from those around me. I’ve even found camaraderie with a close friend quietly participating in Dry January alongside me. The pubs and restaurants I’ve visited (no less than if I had been drinking alcohol) have been eager to provide a variety of non-alcoholic options. During a recent Prosecco and Platters night at The Cross (Croscombe), the owner, Terri, ensured my glass was always filled with alcohol-free Prosecco. There were moments that evening when I might have faltered, but Terri’s thoughtful gestures helped me fully enjoy the night with a clear head.\nNow, a pertinent question arises: What happens after Dry January? Should I extend my commitment, cut back, or return to my old habits? This is the next chapter I need to navigate. In the meantime, I have a follow-up meeting with the Public Health team at Somerset Council where I hope to gather more evidence on post-Dry January experiences.\nAre you participating in Dry January? How has it been for you, and what are your thoughts on what comes next? I’d love to hear from you!",

This is the first new nuclear power plant in over 20 years, after all, purported to cost up to £35bn and it must be switched on. The proportionality of the mitigation, however, is a dark tunnel, with no light – just ask the people in those areas now under the spotlight of potential devastating changes to their lives, homes, businesses and local wildlife, as EDF looks to convert areas to salt marshes.\nIn the press release about the Parliamentary debate, sent by Bridgwater MP Sir Ashley Fox, he says he wants to “highlight the effective advocacy of the [Pawlett Hams] action group at the highest level.” Disappointedly, he didn’t ask this community group to the debate or even tell them about the debate before his press release was published. They contacted Sir Ashley to find out more, he asked what their names were. He hasn’t met them or attended any of their campaign events, despite being invited.\nEDF’s mitigation proposals included a nature reserve next to Hinkley C: Pawlett Hams being flooded and turned into a salt marsh at a reported cost of £50m to compensate for fish being sucked into Hinkley C’s cooling pipes. The salt marsh proposal was as big as 313 hectares (773 acres) along the River Parrett. The Guardian reported this as the “Odd Hinkley Point C salt marsh plan“. It would have destroyed aquatic eco-systems and natural habitat, wildlife homes, as well as ancient farmland, businesses and valued community space for local people and school children. There would have needed to be other mitigation to compensate for the damage done to Pawlett Hams. EDF changed their minds about Pawlett Hams, they are now seeking new locations for the creation of salt marsh as an alternative, and causing further anguish.\nWhen I first became aware of EDF salt marsh proposals I was deeply moved by the powerful quotes (and emotions) from a local Pawlett Hams resident, Rachel, in an article published in The Guardian. I went to find Rachel. After coming across her daughter, Molly, and asked if I could meet Rachel to offer my support. Molly asked when I wanted to meet, and I said “asap, tomorrow?!” Molly said she would get a few others to join us. My next step was to get the Pawlett Hams voice to EDF, to work with EDF, in a constructive manner. I arranged for an initial meeting between the Pawlett Action Group and with EDF’s Andrew Cockcroft, who is Head of Stakeholder Relations and Social Impact. He encouraged our approach of constructive dialogue and understanding from both sides.\nMy involvement was meant to act like a spark, that enabled a small group of villagers to become a shining light of representation, a powerful voice, to stand up for their community and have a say in its future. Ultimately, as an empowered community this helped to influence EDF to reverse their salt marsh plans at Pawlett Hams. But what of the other areas now? I truly hope the spotlight can go back on the Environment Agency and this question of what is proportional mitigation.\nI welcome the Parliamentary debate as an opportunity to tell the story of the Pawlett Hams Action Group and to pass on the legacy of what an empowered community can achieve.\nClaire Sully is a Unitary Councillor, Deputy Chair of Lib Dem ruling group at Somerset Council, Vice Chair Adults & Health Scrutiny Committee, 2024 MP Candidate, Campaigner & Community Champion.\nhttps://clairesully.com/",

That said, I’m sure many will roll their eyes at the outgoing MPs, James Heappey, attempt to jump on the health bandwagon, by suggesting his own involvement helped bring this new rating about. Mr Heappey will know that the government he supports has been the single biggest obstacle to improving health services for the public, both in Burnham and beyond. In 13 years of underfunding, outsourcing, bed closures and acute unit cuts, poor recruitment and increased bureaucracy, the public of the Burnham area has been forced to suffer longer waits to see medical practitioners, both for GP and hospital appointments, as well as reduced critical care response times and often chaotic conditions in hospitals and A&E centres.

Importantly, the forum will also include local communities, ensuring local people have their voices heard when it comes to upgrading the constituency’s transport infrastructure.\nGravity, which through battery Gigafactory company Agratas will bring £4 billion to the economy, has earmarked £150 million for improved infrastructure projects in the region, including for the transport network.\nThe Bridgwater region has significant potential for an improved transport network, including with its rail services. Claire believes industry and communities need to drive the change we need for our clogged-up roads and wants to bring these voices together.\nA 2022 report by Network Rail identified Bridgwater as one of two towns between Bristol and Bridgwater as suffering from suppressed demand due to its inadequate transport links. Just two decades ago, it was possible to reach Liverpool, Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle from Bridgwater, with journeys to Bristol taking just 30 minutes.\nIn 2022/23 Bridgwater Rail Station had an increase in passengers to nearly 500,000 on the year before, accentuating the need for upgrades.\nActive Travel can play a prominent role in linking communities, encouraging sustainable travel for shorter journeys, but it is currently disjointed, while the bus network needs to be fit for purpose.\nClaire said that in order for the constituency to realise its potential, it will require forward thinking and a combination of ideas from across the transport industry and business, and that she will bring the political vision and will to make it happen.\n“It is clear from my conversations with residents, local businesses and leaders of the transport industry that the transport network across Bridgwater, Burnham, Highbridge and our surrounding villages needs to be upgraded in order to meet the demands of growing investment,” Claire said.\n“Whether it’s Active Travel, rail, the bus network or our roads, we need a coordinated approach to ensure we not only deliver accessible routes for business, but also meet the needs of our residents to avoid the fear of thundering lorries and increased traffic. The Road Safety and Transport Infrastructure Forum will ensure this happens.\n“This requires a vision, political will and engagement with local residents. I have a track record of bringing together stakeholders to improve communities, and I will do all I can to help Bridgwater, Burnham, Highbridge and our surrounding villages to reach their potential.”\nDavid Northey added: “To enable Bridgwater and surrounding communities to thrive, you need a transport system that works for everyone as well as giving people options. On rail, the town’s station and its ability to play an active role in travel needs has been over-looked to the detriment of Bridgwater.\n“The town can be the gateway to the Somerset Levels, Glastonbury, Wells and the Quantock Hills as well as provide easy access to the home of Bridgwater and Taunton College. Improvements to the offering of train services, bus connectivity and redevelopment of the empty rooms could bring about a major transformation for the town. We just need to bring the opportunity alive and I look forward to working with Claire help Bridgwater realise its transport potential.”\nPlease don’t forget Highbridge in favour of Bridgwater – both need investment and need the same level of input. All too often Bridgwater gets more.\nI drive my car because I cannot rely on the buses. They continually remove a bus because of staff shortage or sickness…\nI would save money, get extra walking steps in if I coul rely on a bus turning up on time.",

I continue to shine a light on this issue at the Council and beyond.\nIf I am the next MP for the new Bridgwater constituency I will continue to campaign for equality and opportunities that deliver for women in employment.\nMotherhood and the gender pay gap\n[ Extract from government briefing: https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN07068/SN07068.pdf ]\nAnalysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) finds that most of the gender pay gaps can be traced to ‘child penalties’, or parenthood. It finds the average earnings of men are almost completely unaffected by parenthood, but women’s earnings fall sharply when they become parents and then stabilise at a much lower level with little growth.\nThe IFS finds that seven years after the birth of a first child, women’s earnings are on average less than half of men’s.\nThere is little difference in median hourly pay for male and female full-time employees aged in their 20s and 30s, but a substantial gap emerges among full-time employees aged 40 and over. This links to parenthood.\nThe gender pay gap\nThe gender pay gap measures the difference between average (median) hourly earnings of men and women, usually shown by the percentage men earn more than women.\nWhy is there a gender pay gap?\nThe size of the gender pay gap depends on several factors, including age (see above), including:\n• Occupation:\nThe gap tends to be smaller for occupation groups where a larger proportion of employees are women;\n• Industry: The pay gap is largest in the financial and insurance industry, and smallest in the accommodation and food services industry.\n• Pay: The highest earners have a larger pay gap than the lowest earners.\n• Public and private sector: For full-time workers, the pay gap is slightly smaller in the public sector than the private sector. There is a negligible gender pay gap for part-time workers in the private sector, which contrasts with a large part-time pay gap in the public sector;\n• Region and nation: The full-time gender pay gap is highest in the South East and London and negative in Northern Ireland.",

Many pupils experienced major disruption, having been forced to work from home or at other sites in the town and temporary classrooms had to be brought onto the site. Experts told the Department for Education (DfE) that parts of the school might be prone to collapse should it see very high winds or an unusually heavy snowfall.\nThe problematic parts of the school had been built under a £38 million project by now defunct contractor Caledonian Modular as part of a scheme introduced by the current Conservative Government. The government said the contract would fast-track construction and offer value for money, but Haygrove joins a school in Essex in having to close because of doubts about its structural integrity, while two Cornish primary schools built under the contract have had to be demolished before they were even opened.\nClaire Sully said: “While it’s great that a new school is being built to serve Bridgwater, this sorry affair could have been avoided by proper investment in school refurbishment by the Conservative government. They seem to lurch from crisis to crisis, and far from delivering value for money, seem to have wasted millions on unsafe and crumbling school buildings.\n“Parents of Haygrove pupils may not be impressed by the outgoing Bridgwater MP Iain Liddell-Grainger telling the local media that the government helped solve the crisis when it was the same government that created the crisis.\n“Education infrastructure in this country has been allowed to fall into disrepair as building and maintenance budgets have fallen in real terms under the Conservatives, and it’s sad that parents, pupils and school staff in Bridgwater are having to pay the price for Mr Liddle-Grainger’s party’s failings.”",

Bridgwater turning Lib Dem yellow.\nIt’s a very real prospect. Having run the campaign of our lives, we have given ourselves the best possible chance of delivering a Liberal Democrat MP for Bridgwater, Burnham, Highbridge, North Petherton and our surrounding villages.\nWe have delivered seven leaflets, one magazine and engaged and spoken with thousands of people.\nWe’ve run Q&A sessions across the constituency, not only visiting Bridgwater, Burnham and Highbridge but reaching Cannington, Westonzoyland and North Petherton.\nWe’ve held two fundraising events with outstanding results, raising the money needed to undertake the strongest campaign of any political party standing a candidate in Bridgwater.\nAcross the media, our positive message of hope has been shared numerous times, with more than 50 articles published since the turn of the year.\nIt’s promoted our climate agenda, as I’ve helped campaign with the Pawlett Hams Group protecting our natural environment. We’ve campaigned for schools, medical centres, and with our support a new NHS dentist is opening in Bridgwater.\nI’ve visited food banks, helping to set up a coastal watch for Burnham, protected funding for our RNLI service, pushed for better public transport and stood by constituents when no one else would.\nStakeboards have gone up across the constituency. On social media, we’ve reached more than 80,000 people since the beginning of the campaign, promoting our incredible manifesto which will do more to help people in need than any other.\nI attended every hustings I was invited to, unlike Labour, who didn’t attend any, and I relished answering challenging questions.\nBut to win we must translate our support into votes at the ballot box. Remind your friends and family to go and vote – and remember their ID!\nI’d like to thank all those who have been part of this journey and helped in this effort. Your contributions will never be forgotten.\nSo, on Thursday, vote Lib Dem, and I will ensure that a Fair Deal returns to Bridgwater, Burnham, Highbridge and North Petherton.\nWith love and thanks\nClaire\nreally good luck for tomorrow Claire.

  "https_clairesully_com_/https_clairesully_com_claire-sully-selected-as-bridgwater-parliamentary-candidate-for-the-liberal-democrats/content_146.html": "Claire Sully selected as Bridgwater Parliamentary Candidate for the Liberal Democrats\nSomerset Councillor Claire Sully has been selected as the parliamentary candidate for the new Bridgwater constituency seat in a boost to the Liberal Democrats.\nWidely recognised as a community champion and a hardworking elected Somerset councillor, Claire received overwhelming support from the Liberal Democrat members to contest the next general election within the newly created Bridgwater constituency.\nClaire is keen to continue the winning Liberal Democrat momentum in Somerset following the outstanding results at the last local elections in 2022. The Liberal Democrats won a majority on the Somerset Council in a ground-breaking election, with Claire winning more than 50% of the vote in her area. She describes the Bridgwater constituency as ‘one of the most exciting in Somerset’ and believes the Liberal Democrats are the front runners to claim the seat from the failing Conservatives. Following the recent Liberal Democrat parliamentary byelection success in Somerton and Frome, where the party won a massive swing to overturn a huge Conservative majority, they are the real challengers in the new Bridgwater seat.\nThat result followed other huge Liberal Democrat victories in Tiverton and Honiton, North Shropshire and Cheshire and Amersham, all of which were traditionally Conservative-held seats.\nIn addition. Labour finished a distant third in the Somerset elections. The impressive recent election record for the Liberal Democrats in Somerset and elsewhere has seen swathes of traditional Tory voters switch to the party.\nThe current Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency has been held by the Conservative Party since 2010. However, the boundary changes mean that strong Liberal Democrat areas of Burnham-On-Sea and Highbridge are incorporated into the new seat. This sees the Liberal Democrats placed as the most prominent challengers to the Conservatives at the upcoming general election. Based on the Somerset council elections results in May last year with the new boundary changes, this seat is set to be a two-horse race between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.\n“It is an absolute privilege to have been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the new Bridgwater constituency,” said Claire, following the vote of Liberal Democrat members.\n“This new constituency is really dynamic. It has massive potential and with its deep-rooted pride and strong communities, I very much identify with local people from my own upbringing in Somerset.\n“Having met many of the wonderful people across this new constituency, I am confident of unlocking the undoubted promise of these towns and villages. Elected as the MP at the next general election, I would relish the opportunity to represent the constituency’s amazing residents, and as a visible, accessible and constituency MP I will take the local voice to the heart of government.”\nClaire Sully, who runs her own marketing and tech business, has strong family ties to the Bridgwater constituency. Ahead of her selection as parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats, Claire has been hardworking in the constituency. She has been attending events, meeting people and was honoured to be a judge at the recent Carnival in Bridgwater. She also attended the first community-led Eco Festival in Burnham on Sea and Highbridge.\n“Of course, the outstanding Bridgwater Carnival is a highlight in the calendar for so many local residents and people who travel to the area for it. It is a celebration of all that this region has to offer, including creativity and ingenuity. it was such a pleasure to be at the heart of it, spending time with some of the longest serving members of the Carnival community, some of whom have been involved for 50 years”, Claire continued.\n“In the Bridgwater seat it will be an election battle between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who have woefully failed constituents with their mismanagement of the economy and the NHS, creating a cost-of-living crisis, and with scandal after scandal in parliament. Time is up for the Tories, we need a political reset at the next General Election, and the only way to ensure that is with a vote for a new Lib Dem candidate who has the passion and drive that will make a difference to local constituents’ lives.”\nNote to editor:\nContact Claire via e-mail: contactclairesully@gmail.com\nN.B.The current MP in Bridgwater and West Somerset, Ian Liddell-Grainger, is not standing to be MP in the new Bridgwater constituency.\nSomerset Council elections 2022 – New Bridgwater Constituency\nLiberal Democrats 15,006 35%\nConservatives 19,541 45.6%\nLabour 7,052 16.4%\nGreen 791 1.8%\nIndependent ` 474 1.1%",

Tony Cradock also spoke about the excellent work (and future ambition) undertaken at the Morlands Community Hub in Highbridge.\nProfessional singer Tim Pitman, from Burnham-on-Sea, provided the entertainment for the evening. An auction of items, showcasing local makers was also an unequivocal success.\nAfter the event and having spoken to several attendees and supporters who are undertaking brilliant work in the constituency, Claire said: “This event has really demonstrated the brilliance that Bridgwater, Burnham and Highbridge, North Petherton and all our surrounding villages has to offer.\n“It was fantastic to see so many people in attendance, all of whom made the evening fun and a resounding success.\n“I’m grateful to Claire Pearce, Bill Revans and Tony Cradock, who all gave superb speeches and are examples of the amazing people we can celebrate within this constituency.\n“The message from the evening was clear; a new Bridgwater constituency requires a new voice. A voice that will prioritise the people of Bridgwater, Burnham and Highbridge and unlock its potential. I will be that voice for all. To anyone wanting a change in direction and the best for this new Bridgwater constituency, we can all unite and do this together.”\nGravity director Claire Pearce in her speech shed more light on the project, which is situated on a 616-acre site near Puriton. The site has been the subject of an announced £4 billion investment from Agratas to construct a gigafactory, which will provide 4,000 jobs in a significant boost to the local economy. It was also announced on Wednesday that a new leisure centre, open to residents, would be built at the 37 Club where yesterday’s ‘Shine A Light On…’ event was held.\nClaire Pearce highlighted the importance of upskilling now and for future generations in the local area and the economic benefits to the local community that the Gravity site will provide.\nBill Revans told the audience that Claire Sully represents a new generation of genuine, community-focused politicians, building on the momentum of a strong Lib Dem presence throughout the county.\nClaire told the packed room: “I am proud to be running for MP here in what I think is the most exciting area in the county, if not the country, with so much to offer, opportunities and potential..\n“What makes it great is the people and the communities, who drive things, day in day out. As MP I will be a strong, passionate voice for those communities.”",

With Keir Starmer’s Labour having lurched to the right, abandoning the party’s socialist roots, the Liberal Democrats are the only real alternative to the Conservatives at this election.\nThe Lib Dems could be just a four-seat swing from becoming the official opposition after this election, relegating the Tories to third.\nBut it is only possible if the Liberal Democrats can win seats such as Bridgwater.\nOn July 4, choose the real tactical vote. The one that consigns the Conservatives out of opposition and into third. Vote for your hard working community champion Claire Sully and the Liberal Democrats."
