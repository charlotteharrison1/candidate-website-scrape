I have copied below some of the relevant sections of the most recent responses from officers to illustrate the decision-making process.\nI am disappointed that I have not been able to get this scheme delivered for you (yet), however I will continue to seek solutions and I will work with the relevant portfolio holders and officers to identify funding opportunities as and when they become available.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 27 April.\nWhilst both elected divisional county councillor and cabinet member for highways and transportation may respond to a petition; I can confirm that we have not received a response in respect to the petition regarding extending the double yellow lines on Village Way, Buckshaw Village.\nObservations have been carried out on Village Way, Buckshaw Village on the following dates:\n3 March 2017 AM drop off\n17 March 2017 PM pick up\n28 March 2017 PM pick up\n20 April 2017 AM drop off\nThe presence of parked vehicles within urban areas is a common occurrence and can result in lower traffic speeds due to the requirement for vehicles to give way to opposing traffic flows. Village Way at this location features excellent visibility of oncoming traffic in both directions and we would expect approaching vehicles to comply with procedures laid down in the Highway Code to ensure that they do not come into conflict with other road users. Village Way currently is currently subject to an advisory 20mph speed limit during school start and finish times with a mandatory speed limit of 30mph outside of these times.\nObservations carried out to date have revealed that vehicles are approaching the crossing location with appropriate caution and that the location is currently operating satisfactorily in terms of road safety which is supported by the historical lack of incidents in the vicinity.\nInformation provided by the Police confirms that the incident referred to occurred on Sunday 5 March 2017 with the Police in attendance at 14:31hrs. The driver of the vehicle was detained at the scene for a drink driving offence and there is no association between the circumstances of this incident and weekday school traffic or parking behaviour at the location.\nI appreciate our decision is disappointing we have a responsibility to allocate our finite resources based up on greatest need.\nAs the highway authority we have a finite budget and a responsibility to prioritise our resources that best serve the residents and road users in Lancashire. Our current priority is to target those resources at locations with significant numbers of injury accidents, in addition to schemes that will contribute to the improvement of the highway network.\nThe road safety record at this location is good with no recorded injury accidents occurring in the past 5 years or longer. Notwithstanding your constituents concerns, when we have locations that do have a history of collisions causing injury and sadly fatalities that are competing for funding for traffic schemes, it would be remiss of the county council to divert the limited funding we have to locations that do not. Therefore we are unable to support further measures at this junction at the present time.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 18 May.\nThe councils commitment is to prioritise funding on fulfilling our statutory responsibility of maintaining a safe highway network. We have seen reductions in both available budget and staff and our limited resources, in particular to traffic related issues we are focussed in delivering schemes which has a demonstrable positive impact in reducing casualty figures; it would therefore be remiss of the council to consider delivering traffic schemes at locations where there is a good safety record when there are still so many locations with very poor accident statistics currently waiting and competing for funding for schemes. This is the mandate set by the council and as such it is not within officers discretion to consider delivering schemes which does not fulfil our prioritisation strategy.\nFollowing on from this meetings with members is very resource intensive and a county council directive was issued nearly 2 years ago which acknowledged this in light of the much reduced staffing levels the county council now supports with an increased demand in services. Site visits are only considered if they will be mutually beneficial i.e. we have funding options or the officer needs a better understanding of the issue at hand. Neither criteria falls within your requests for visits as officers fully understand the issues at hand and notwithstanding your desire for a positive way forward we have no scheme options and our position would be unchanged despite meeting and therefore we are unable to justify that it is a good use of our finite resources.",

The condition was to ensure that the rugby facilities were completed and that a situation could not arise whereby the houses were built without them being provided.\nAlthough the conditions are now proposed to be removed in their entirety, Persimmon will still submit a unilateral undertaking agreement with a longstop date that the rugby facilities would be commenced within two years from the date of this approval and completed within five years\nA link to the full report and recommendations can be found here – https://democracy.chorley.gov.uk/…/s…/Item%203c%20Report.pdf",

You can see the interview on their website, on their YouTube channel as well as during their news bulletins.\nI have written to BAe asking them to reconsider their decision and I am awaiting their response.\nNorthern are consulting on timetable changes to services from May 2018\nI echo the comments by LCC relating to Buckshaw Parkway: ‘We welcome the improvement to the calls at this station providing earlier services from the station and additional peak services providing additional commuting opportunities for this expanding community.’\nThese build on the more modest service changes that are being introduced this December and are a stepping stone to the more significant timetable changes that will take place in December 2019 when all the infrastructure upgrades will be complete and the new rolling stock introduced.\nA couple of days ago I met up with Simon and Jack from RMGBuckshaw and below is a summary of our discussions.

Out of the 170 comments to date, I think only 4 or 5 are not in favour of saving it with the rest fully supportive.\nLocal TV Station ‘That’s Lancashire‘ came to the village today to talk to me about it. You can see the interview on their website, on their YouTube channel as well as during their news bulletins.\nI have written to BAe asking them to reconsider their decision and I am awaiting their response.\nNorthern are consulting on timetable changes to services from May 2018\nI echo the comments by LCC relating to Buckshaw Parkway: ‘We welcome the improvement to the calls at this station providing earlier services from the station and additional peak services providing additional commuting opportunities for this expanding community.’\nThese build on the more modest service changes that are being introduced this December and are a stepping stone to the more significant timetable changes that will take place in December 2019 when all the infrastructure upgrades will be complete and the new rolling stock introduced.\nA couple of days ago I met up with Simon and Jack from RMGBuckshaw and below is a summary of our discussions. We meet regularly so if there are any items you would like raising, drop me a message. 👍🏻",

I have copied below some of the relevant sections of the most recent responses from officers to illustrate the decision-making process.\nI am disappointed that I have not been able to get this scheme delivered for you (yet), however I will continue to seek solutions and I will work with the relevant portfolio holders and officers to identify funding opportunities as and when they become available.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 27 April.\nWhilst both elected divisional county councillor and cabinet member for highways and transportation may respond to a petition; I can confirm that we have not received a response in respect to the petition regarding extending the double yellow lines on Village Way, Buckshaw Village.\nObservations have been carried out on Village Way, Buckshaw Village on the following dates:\n3 March 2017 AM drop off\n17 March 2017 PM pick up\n28 March 2017 PM pick up\n20 April 2017 AM drop off\nThe presence of parked vehicles within urban areas is a common occurrence and can result in lower traffic speeds due to the requirement for vehicles to give way to opposing traffic flows. Village Way at this location features excellent visibility of oncoming traffic in both directions and we would expect approaching vehicles to comply with procedures laid down in the Highway Code to ensure that they do not come into conflict with other road users. Village Way currently is currently subject to an advisory 20mph speed limit during school start and finish times with a mandatory speed limit of 30mph outside of these times.\nObservations carried out to date have revealed that vehicles are approaching the crossing location with appropriate caution and that the location is currently operating satisfactorily in terms of road safety which is supported by the historical lack of incidents in the vicinity.\nInformation provided by the Police confirms that the incident referred to occurred on Sunday 5 March 2017 with the Police in attendance at 14:31hrs. The driver of the vehicle was detained at the scene for a drink driving offence and there is no association between the circumstances of this incident and weekday school traffic or parking behaviour at the location.\nI appreciate our decision is disappointing we have a responsibility to allocate our finite resources based up on greatest need.\nAs the highway authority we have a finite budget and a responsibility to prioritise our resources that best serve the residents and road users in Lancashire. Our current priority is to target those resources at locations with significant numbers of injury accidents, in addition to schemes that will contribute to the improvement of the highway network.\nThe road safety record at this location is good with no recorded injury accidents occurring in the past 5 years or longer. Notwithstanding your constituents concerns, when we have locations that do have a history of collisions causing injury and sadly fatalities that are competing for funding for traffic schemes, it would be remiss of the county council to divert the limited funding we have to locations that do not. Therefore we are unable to support further measures at this junction at the present time.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 18 May.\nThe councils commitment is to prioritise funding on fulfilling our statutory responsibility of maintaining a safe highway network. We have seen reductions in both available budget and staff and our limited resources, in particular to traffic related issues we are focussed in delivering schemes which has a demonstrable positive impact in reducing casualty figures; it would therefore be remiss of the council to consider delivering traffic schemes at locations where there is a good safety record when there are still so many locations with very poor accident statistics currently waiting and competing for funding for schemes. This is the mandate set by the council and as such it is not within officers discretion to consider delivering schemes which does not fulfil our prioritisation strategy.\nFollowing on from this meetings with members is very resource intensive and a county council directive was issued nearly 2 years ago which acknowledged this in light of the much reduced staffing levels the county council now supports with an increased demand in services. Site visits are only considered if they will be mutually beneficial i.e. we have funding options or the officer needs a better understanding of the issue at hand. Neither criteria falls within your requests for visits as officers fully understand the issues at hand and notwithstanding your desire for a positive way forward we have no scheme options and our position would be unchanged despite meeting and therefore we are unable to justify that it is a good use of our finite resources.",

It’s great to see the competitors close up and be a small part of it all. And the sun came out ☀️\nMetal Fencing – Buckshaw Avenue\nAfter numerous requests for information, the latest update I have regarding the metal fencing across the front of Dominos is…\nThe premises are owned by Primrose Holdings who state that the fencing is up to help protect the grassed/ shrub area whilst Aldi create a number of crossing points as required by their planning permission. It is a temporary fix which will be removed when this happens.\nAs Aldi has been open for at least 12 months, I have asked whether there is a timescale on when this outstanding work will be complete and whether this is detailed in any agreed planning documents that enables enforcement action to be taken if required.\nPrimrose Hill School Visit\nReally enjoyable day today. First up a trip to County Hall for a meeting followed by a quick lunch. This afternoon started with a visit to Primrose Hill School in Euxton followed by 3 meetings with residents in Astley Village and a quick chat with the guys at RMGBuckshaw on my way home. Time for a quick coffee then off out tonight as well.\nDerian House Open Day\nAnother summers afternoon, another great cause to support – this time Derian House Open Day. The kids loved the outdoor activities whilst Sarah Jane and I found the tour really interesting with an insight into the amazing work that goes on at Derian House.\nTrinity Summer Fair – Buckshaw Village\nGreat family fun in the sun helping to run the Teddy Tombola this afternoon at the fantastic Trinity PFA Summer Fair.

  "https_aidyriggottbv_wordpress_com_/https_aidyriggottbv_wordpress_com_2017_06_05_yellow-lines-update/content_58.html": "It is with considerable disappointment that I write this update but I believe in being transparent with residents, whether the news is good or in this case, not so good.\nAs it stands LCC are not going to agree to providing the funding to fill the gap in the double yellow lines on Village Way. I have copied below some of the relevant sections of the most recent responses from officers to illustrate the decision-making process.\nI am disappointed that I have not been able to get this scheme delivered for you (yet), however I will continue to seek solutions and I will work with the relevant portfolio holders and officers to identify funding opportunities as and when they become available.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 27 April.\nWhilst both elected divisional county councillor and cabinet member for highways and transportation may respond to a petition; I can confirm that we have not received a response in respect to the petition regarding extending the double yellow lines on Village Way, Buckshaw Village.\nObservations have been carried out on Village Way, Buckshaw Village on the following dates:\n3 March 2017 AM drop off\n17 March 2017 PM pick up\n28 March 2017 PM pick up\n20 April 2017 AM drop off\nThe presence of parked vehicles within urban areas is a common occurrence and can result in lower traffic speeds due to the requirement for vehicles to give way to opposing traffic flows. Village Way at this location features excellent visibility of oncoming traffic in both directions and we would expect approaching vehicles to comply with procedures laid down in the Highway Code to ensure that they do not come into conflict with other road users. Village Way currently is currently subject to an advisory 20mph speed limit during school start and finish times with a mandatory speed limit of 30mph outside of these times.\nObservations carried out to date have revealed that vehicles are approaching the crossing location with appropriate caution and that the location is currently operating satisfactorily in terms of road safety which is supported by the historical lack of incidents in the vicinity.\nInformation provided by the Police confirms that the incident referred to occurred on Sunday 5 March 2017 with the Police in attendance at 14:31hrs. The driver of the vehicle was detained at the scene for a drink driving offence and there is no association between the circumstances of this incident and weekday school traffic or parking behaviour at the location.\nI appreciate our decision is disappointing we have a responsibility to allocate our finite resources based up on greatest need.\nAs the highway authority we have a finite budget and a responsibility to prioritise our resources that best serve the residents and road users in Lancashire. Our current priority is to target those resources at locations with significant numbers of injury accidents, in addition to schemes that will contribute to the improvement of the highway network.\nThe road safety record at this location is good with no recorded injury accidents occurring in the past 5 years or longer. Notwithstanding your constituents concerns, when we have locations that do have a history of collisions causing injury and sadly fatalities that are competing for funding for traffic schemes, it would be remiss of the county council to divert the limited funding we have to locations that do not. Therefore we are unable to support further measures at this junction at the present time.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 18 May.\nThe councils commitment is to prioritise funding on fulfilling our statutory responsibility of maintaining a safe highway network. We have seen reductions in both available budget and staff and our limited resources, in particular to traffic related issues we are focussed in delivering schemes which has a demonstrable positive impact in reducing casualty figures; it would therefore be remiss of the council to consider delivering traffic schemes at locations where there is a good safety record when there are still so many locations with very poor accident statistics currently waiting and competing for funding for schemes. This is the mandate set by the council and as such it is not within officers discretion to consider delivering schemes which does not fulfil our prioritisation strategy.\nFollowing on from this meetings with members is very resource intensive and a county council directive was issued nearly 2 years ago which acknowledged this in light of the much reduced staffing levels the county council now supports with an increased demand in services. Site visits are only considered if they will be mutually beneficial i.e. we have funding options or the officer needs a better understanding of the issue at hand. Neither criteria falls within your requests for visits as officers fully understand the issues at hand and notwithstanding your desire for a positive way forward we have no scheme options and our position would be unchanged despite meeting and therefore we are unable to justify that it is a good use of our finite resources.",

The condition was to ensure that the rugby facilities were completed and that a situation could not arise whereby the houses were built without them being provided.\nAlthough the conditions are now proposed to be removed in their entirety, Persimmon will still submit a unilateral undertaking agreement with a longstop date that the rugby facilities would be commenced within two years from the date of this approval and completed within five years\nA link to the full report and recommendations can be found here – https://democracy.chorley.gov.uk/…/s…/Item%203c%20Report.pdf",

Without them, Buckshaw Youth Association would not exist.\nI must thank all those who joined the team to volunteer their time including Simon from RMGBuckshaw, PCSO Ray Chadwick, local resident Vicky Thompson and Michelle Graham from Chorley Youth Zone. Again I must thank our home grown former members Heather Watson, Jack Grover, Alice Reeves, Harvey Taylor and Chelsea Edgington who help lead the sessions on a Friday evening.\nOnce again we were joined by the team from MACY (Music & Arts for Creative Youth) ably led by Zoe and Marie who ran their popular wide variety of craft and creative projects, with support from wider members of the MACY team to bringing in karaoke sessions and drama workshops.\nAt Christmas we joined forces with many organisations including The BVCA ( Buckshaw Village Community Association ), Buckshaw Village Church, Friends of Buckshaw Village, RMG, SJL Heating & Plumbing, Buckshaw Leaflet Distribution and many others to hold the first combined Christmas Event in Buckshaw Village. It was a fabulous and highly memorable occasion that will be tough to beat next time around and I would personally like to thank all those involved who made it happen. I would also like to thank local Councillors Debra Platt and Mark Jarnell for their grants towards the cost of the Christmas tree.\nWe once again have been issuing Lancashire Time Credits to volunteers and have issued in excess of 200 Time Credits this year. Our Facebook page (now with 185 Likes) is proving popular in keeping parents informed of our weekly activities and opening dates, as is our Twitter account.\nFinally I must once again thank Alan Platt for the continued variety his purchasing brings to our tuck shop, Lee Williams for his never ending mopping and sweeping on a Friday night and for the good humour they both bring as well as the support and advice they offer to those members leading the Friday evening sessions. It is hugely appreciated.\nThanks Aidy\nChairman – Buckshaw Youth Association.\nBalshaw Lane Primary School Visit\nYesterday I had the pleasure of taking up an invitation from Ms Gregson, the Headteacher at Balshaw Lane Primary, to visit her superb school.\nWe had a good chat about education, the role of the County Council, we looked at the exciting plans for the new extension and took a tour of the school.\nIt is a real privilege to have been given this opportunity, to see school life in full swing with lots of happy children playing and learning at the same time.\nSpeeding on Balshaw Lane\nEuxton Primrose Hill & Euxton Care Home\nA truly wonderful day.\nFirst up was an invitation to the Opening Ceremony at Euxton Primrose Hill Primary School. The new extension is an excellent addition to the school and everybody involved should be very proud of their achievements. The singing by the pupils was wonderful, especially KS2 which left many with a tear in their eye.\nThis afternoon I was invited to Euxton Park Care Home’s Open Day where I received a tour of the facilities and met with staff and residents. Everybody was having a great time, especially those listening to the live singer. I have promised to attend more of their events and to keep in touch with the residents in this slightly hidden part of Euxton.\nAstley Village Trees\nLovely evening last night in #Astley Village talking to residents and offering my help with tree issues. 🌳🌳🌳\nEuxton Library Friends\nElan Place Flooding\nRunshaw Lane Pelican Crossing\n🚸🚸🚸 Pleased to report that following concerns raised to me by Gemma Rypel Euxton on behalf of residents…\nLCC Officers have carried out a site inspection and the current school crossing patrol signage on Runshaw Lane will be updated to reflect the presence of the new permanent crossings. This should take place in about 4 weeks time. #teamwork 🚸🚸🚸",

I have copied below some of the relevant sections of the most recent responses from officers to illustrate the decision-making process.\nI am disappointed that I have not been able to get this scheme delivered for you (yet), however I will continue to seek solutions and I will work with the relevant portfolio holders and officers to identify funding opportunities as and when they become available.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 27 April.\nWhilst both elected divisional county councillor and cabinet member for highways and transportation may respond to a petition; I can confirm that we have not received a response in respect to the petition regarding extending the double yellow lines on Village Way, Buckshaw Village.\nObservations have been carried out on Village Way, Buckshaw Village on the following dates:\n3 March 2017 AM drop off\n17 March 2017 PM pick up\n28 March 2017 PM pick up\n20 April 2017 AM drop off\nThe presence of parked vehicles within urban areas is a common occurrence and can result in lower traffic speeds due to the requirement for vehicles to give way to opposing traffic flows. Village Way at this location features excellent visibility of oncoming traffic in both directions and we would expect approaching vehicles to comply with procedures laid down in the Highway Code to ensure that they do not come into conflict with other road users. Village Way currently is currently subject to an advisory 20mph speed limit during school start and finish times with a mandatory speed limit of 30mph outside of these times.\nObservations carried out to date have revealed that vehicles are approaching the crossing location with appropriate caution and that the location is currently operating satisfactorily in terms of road safety which is supported by the historical lack of incidents in the vicinity.\nInformation provided by the Police confirms that the incident referred to occurred on Sunday 5 March 2017 with the Police in attendance at 14:31hrs. The driver of the vehicle was detained at the scene for a drink driving offence and there is no association between the circumstances of this incident and weekday school traffic or parking behaviour at the location.\nI appreciate our decision is disappointing we have a responsibility to allocate our finite resources based up on greatest need.\nAs the highway authority we have a finite budget and a responsibility to prioritise our resources that best serve the residents and road users in Lancashire. Our current priority is to target those resources at locations with significant numbers of injury accidents, in addition to schemes that will contribute to the improvement of the highway network.\nThe road safety record at this location is good with no recorded injury accidents occurring in the past 5 years or longer. Notwithstanding your constituents concerns, when we have locations that do have a history of collisions causing injury and sadly fatalities that are competing for funding for traffic schemes, it would be remiss of the county council to divert the limited funding we have to locations that do not. Therefore we are unable to support further measures at this junction at the present time.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 18 May.\nThe councils commitment is to prioritise funding on fulfilling our statutory responsibility of maintaining a safe highway network. We have seen reductions in both available budget and staff and our limited resources, in particular to traffic related issues we are focussed in delivering schemes which has a demonstrable positive impact in reducing casualty figures; it would therefore be remiss of the council to consider delivering traffic schemes at locations where there is a good safety record when there are still so many locations with very poor accident statistics currently waiting and competing for funding for schemes. This is the mandate set by the council and as such it is not within officers discretion to consider delivering schemes which does not fulfil our prioritisation strategy.\nFollowing on from this meetings with members is very resource intensive and a county council directive was issued nearly 2 years ago which acknowledged this in light of the much reduced staffing levels the county council now supports with an increased demand in services. Site visits are only considered if they will be mutually beneficial i.e. we have funding options or the officer needs a better understanding of the issue at hand. Neither criteria falls within your requests for visits as officers fully understand the issues at hand and notwithstanding your desire for a positive way forward we have no scheme options and our position would be unchanged despite meeting and therefore we are unable to justify that it is a good use of our finite resources.",

Without them, Buckshaw Youth Association would not exist.\nI must thank all those who joined the team to volunteer their time including Simon from RMGBuckshaw, PCSO Ray Chadwick, local resident Vicky Thompson and Michelle Graham from Chorley Youth Zone. Again I must thank our home grown former members Heather Watson, Jack Grover, Alice Reeves, Harvey Taylor and Chelsea Edgington who help lead the sessions on a Friday evening.\nOnce again we were joined by the team from MACY (Music & Arts for Creative Youth) ably led by Zoe and Marie who ran their popular wide variety of craft and creative projects, with support from wider members of the MACY team to bringing in karaoke sessions and drama workshops.\nAt Christmas we joined forces with many organisations including The BVCA ( Buckshaw Village Community Association ), Buckshaw Village Church, Friends of Buckshaw Village, RMG, SJL Heating & Plumbing, Buckshaw Leaflet Distribution and many others to hold the first combined Christmas Event in Buckshaw Village. It was a fabulous and highly memorable occasion that will be tough to beat next time around and I would personally like to thank all those involved who made it happen. I would also like to thank local Councillors Debra Platt and Mark Jarnell for their grants towards the cost of the Christmas tree.\nWe once again have been issuing Lancashire Time Credits to volunteers and have issued in excess of 200 Time Credits this year. Our Facebook page (now with 185 Likes) is proving popular in keeping parents informed of our weekly activities and opening dates, as is our Twitter account.\nFinally I must once again thank Alan Platt for the continued variety his purchasing brings to our tuck shop, Lee Williams for his never ending mopping and sweeping on a Friday night and for the good humour they both bring as well as the support and advice they offer to those members leading the Friday evening sessions. It is hugely appreciated.\nThanks Aidy\nChairman – Buckshaw Youth Association.\nBalshaw Lane Primary School Visit\nYesterday I had the pleasure of taking up an invitation from Ms Gregson, the Headteacher at Balshaw Lane Primary, to visit her superb school.\nWe had a good chat about education, the role of the County Council, we looked at the exciting plans for the new extension and took a tour of the school.\nIt is a real privilege to have been given this opportunity, to see school life in full swing with lots of happy children playing and learning at the same time.\nSpeeding on Balshaw Lane\nEuxton Primrose Hill & Euxton Care Home\nA truly wonderful day.\nFirst up was an invitation to the Opening Ceremony at Euxton Primrose Hill Primary School. The new extension is an excellent addition to the school and everybody involved should be very proud of their achievements. The singing by the pupils was wonderful, especially KS2 which left many with a tear in their eye.\nThis afternoon I was invited to Euxton Park Care Home’s Open Day where I received a tour of the facilities and met with staff and residents. Everybody was having a great time, especially those listening to the live singer. I have promised to attend more of their events and to keep in touch with the residents in this slightly hidden part of Euxton.\nAstley Village Trees\nLovely evening last night in #Astley Village talking to residents and offering my help with tree issues. 🌳🌳🌳\nEuxton Library Friends\nElan Place Flooding\nRunshaw Lane Pelican Crossing\n🚸🚸🚸 Pleased to report that following concerns raised to me by Gemma Rypel Euxton on behalf of residents…\nLCC Officers have carried out a site inspection and the current school crossing patrol signage on Runshaw Lane will be updated to reflect the presence of the new permanent crossings. This should take place in about 4 weeks time. #teamwork 🚸🚸🚸",

The condition was to ensure that the rugby facilities were completed and that a situation could not arise whereby the houses were built without them being provided.\nAlthough the conditions are now proposed to be removed in their entirety, Persimmon will still submit a unilateral undertaking agreement with a longstop date that the rugby facilities would be commenced within two years from the date of this approval and completed within five years\nA link to the full report and recommendations can be found here – https://democracy.chorley.gov.uk/…/s…/Item%203c%20Report.pdf",

I have copied below some of the relevant sections of the most recent responses from officers to illustrate the decision-making process.\nI am disappointed that I have not been able to get this scheme delivered for you (yet), however I will continue to seek solutions and I will work with the relevant portfolio holders and officers to identify funding opportunities as and when they become available.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 27 April.\nWhilst both elected divisional county councillor and cabinet member for highways and transportation may respond to a petition; I can confirm that we have not received a response in respect to the petition regarding extending the double yellow lines on Village Way, Buckshaw Village.\nObservations have been carried out on Village Way, Buckshaw Village on the following dates:\n3 March 2017 AM drop off\n17 March 2017 PM pick up\n28 March 2017 PM pick up\n20 April 2017 AM drop off\nThe presence of parked vehicles within urban areas is a common occurrence and can result in lower traffic speeds due to the requirement for vehicles to give way to opposing traffic flows. Village Way at this location features excellent visibility of oncoming traffic in both directions and we would expect approaching vehicles to comply with procedures laid down in the Highway Code to ensure that they do not come into conflict with other road users. Village Way currently is currently subject to an advisory 20mph speed limit during school start and finish times with a mandatory speed limit of 30mph outside of these times.\nObservations carried out to date have revealed that vehicles are approaching the crossing location with appropriate caution and that the location is currently operating satisfactorily in terms of road safety which is supported by the historical lack of incidents in the vicinity.\nInformation provided by the Police confirms that the incident referred to occurred on Sunday 5 March 2017 with the Police in attendance at 14:31hrs. The driver of the vehicle was detained at the scene for a drink driving offence and there is no association between the circumstances of this incident and weekday school traffic or parking behaviour at the location.\nI appreciate our decision is disappointing we have a responsibility to allocate our finite resources based up on greatest need.\nAs the highway authority we have a finite budget and a responsibility to prioritise our resources that best serve the residents and road users in Lancashire. Our current priority is to target those resources at locations with significant numbers of injury accidents, in addition to schemes that will contribute to the improvement of the highway network.\nThe road safety record at this location is good with no recorded injury accidents occurring in the past 5 years or longer. Notwithstanding your constituents concerns, when we have locations that do have a history of collisions causing injury and sadly fatalities that are competing for funding for traffic schemes, it would be remiss of the county council to divert the limited funding we have to locations that do not. Therefore we are unable to support further measures at this junction at the present time.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 18 May.\nThe councils commitment is to prioritise funding on fulfilling our statutory responsibility of maintaining a safe highway network. We have seen reductions in both available budget and staff and our limited resources, in particular to traffic related issues we are focussed in delivering schemes which has a demonstrable positive impact in reducing casualty figures; it would therefore be remiss of the council to consider delivering traffic schemes at locations where there is a good safety record when there are still so many locations with very poor accident statistics currently waiting and competing for funding for schemes. This is the mandate set by the council and as such it is not within officers discretion to consider delivering schemes which does not fulfil our prioritisation strategy.\nFollowing on from this meetings with members is very resource intensive and a county council directive was issued nearly 2 years ago which acknowledged this in light of the much reduced staffing levels the county council now supports with an increased demand in services. Site visits are only considered if they will be mutually beneficial i.e. we have funding options or the officer needs a better understanding of the issue at hand. Neither criteria falls within your requests for visits as officers fully understand the issues at hand and notwithstanding your desire for a positive way forward we have no scheme options and our position would be unchanged despite meeting and therefore we are unable to justify that it is a good use of our finite resources.",

I will make further enquiries and update again soon.\nLast week I met up with Simon from RMGBuckshaw for the latest in our regular meetings. Simon has once again kindly produced these notes for sharing with residents and I hope you find these useful 👍🏻\nIf you see me loitering down Pear Tree Lane #Euxton this afternoon it’s all in a good cause. Traffic surveys for the appeal against Gladman.\nA big big thank you to everyone who voted on my Pillbox post a few days ago. Out of the 170 comments to date, I think only 4 or 5 are not in favour of saving it with the rest fully supportive.\nLocal TV Station ‘That’s Lancashire‘ came to the village today to talk to me about it. You can see the interview on their website, on their YouTube channel as well as during their news bulletins.\nI have written to BAe asking them to reconsider their decision and I am awaiting their response.\nNorthern are consulting on timetable changes to services from May 2018\nI echo the comments by LCC relating to Buckshaw Parkway: ‘We welcome the improvement to the calls at this station providing earlier services from the station and additional peak services providing additional commuting opportunities for this expanding community.’\nThese build on the more modest service changes that are being introduced this December and are a stepping stone to the more significant timetable changes that will take place in December 2019 when all the infrastructure upgrades will be complete and the new rolling stock introduced.\nA couple of days ago I met up with Simon and Jack from RMGBuckshaw and below is a summary of our discussions.

Again I must thank our home grown former members Heather Watson, Jack Grover, Alice Reeves, Harvey Taylor and Chelsea Edgington who help lead the sessions on a Friday evening.\nOnce again we were joined by the team from MACY (Music & Arts for Creative Youth) ably led by Zoe and Marie who ran their popular wide variety of craft and creative projects, with support from wider members of the MACY team to bringing in karaoke sessions and drama workshops.\nAt Christmas we joined forces with many organisations including The BVCA ( Buckshaw Village Community Association ), Buckshaw Village Church, Friends of Buckshaw Village, RMG, SJL Heating & Plumbing, Buckshaw Leaflet Distribution and many others to hold the first combined Christmas Event in Buckshaw Village. It was a fabulous and highly memorable occasion that will be tough to beat next time around and I would personally like to thank all those involved who made it happen. I would also like to thank local Councillors Debra Platt and Mark Jarnell for their grants towards the cost of the Christmas tree.\nWe once again have been issuing Lancashire Time Credits to volunteers and have issued in excess of 200 Time Credits this year. Our Facebook page (now with 185 Likes) is proving popular in keeping parents informed of our weekly activities and opening dates, as is our Twitter account.\nFinally I must once again thank Alan Platt for the continued variety his purchasing brings to our tuck shop, Lee Williams for his never ending mopping and sweeping on a Friday night and for the good humour they both bring as well as the support and advice they offer to those members leading the Friday evening sessions. It is hugely appreciated.\nThanks Aidy\nChairman – Buckshaw Youth Association.",

Village Way at this location features excellent visibility of oncoming traffic in both directions and we would expect approaching vehicles to comply with procedures laid down in the Highway Code to ensure that they do not come into conflict with other road users. Village Way currently is currently subject to an advisory 20mph speed limit during school start and finish times with a mandatory speed limit of 30mph outside of these times.\nObservations carried out to date have revealed that vehicles are approaching the crossing location with appropriate caution and that the location is currently operating satisfactorily in terms of road safety which is supported by the historical lack of incidents in the vicinity.\nInformation provided by the Police confirms that the incident referred to occurred on Sunday 5 March 2017 with the Police in attendance at 14:31hrs. The driver of the vehicle was detained at the scene for a drink driving offence and there is no association between the circumstances of this incident and weekday school traffic or parking behaviour at the location.\nI appreciate our decision is disappointing we have a responsibility to allocate our finite resources based up on greatest need.\nAs the highway authority we have a finite budget and a responsibility to prioritise our resources that best serve the residents and road users in Lancashire.

Notwithstanding your constituents concerns, when we have locations that do have a history of collisions causing injury and sadly fatalities that are competing for funding for traffic schemes, it would be remiss of the county council to divert the limited funding we have to locations that do not.

We have seen reductions in both available budget and staff and our limited resources, in particular to traffic related issues we are focussed in delivering schemes which has a demonstrable positive impact in reducing casualty figures; it would therefore be remiss of the council to consider delivering traffic schemes at locations where there is a good safety record when there are still so many locations with very poor accident statistics currently waiting and competing for funding for schemes. This is the mandate set by the council and as such it is not within officers discretion to consider delivering schemes which does not fulfil our prioritisation strategy.\nFollowing on from this meetings with members is very resource intensive and a county council directive was issued nearly 2 years ago which acknowledged this in light of the much reduced staffing levels the county council now supports with an increased demand in services. Site visits are only considered if they will be mutually beneficial i.e. we have funding options or the officer needs a better understanding of the issue at hand. Neither criteria falls within your requests for visits as officers fully understand the issues at hand and notwithstanding your desire for a positive way forward we have no scheme options and our position would be unchanged despite meeting and therefore we are unable to justify that it is a good use of our finite resources.",

I will make further enquiries and update again soon.\nLast week I met up with Simon from RMGBuckshaw for the latest in our regular meetings. Simon has once again kindly produced these notes for sharing with residents and I hope you find these useful 👍🏻\nIf you see me loitering down Pear Tree Lane #Euxton this afternoon it’s all in a good cause. Traffic surveys for the appeal against Gladman.\nA big big thank you to everyone who voted on my Pillbox post a few days ago. Out of the 170 comments to date, I think only 4 or 5 are not in favour of saving it with the rest fully supportive.\nLocal TV Station ‘That’s Lancashire‘ came to the village today to talk to me about it. You can see the interview on their website, on their YouTube channel as well as during their news bulletins.\nI have written to BAe asking them to reconsider their decision and I am awaiting their response.\nNorthern are consulting on timetable changes to services from May 2018\nI echo the comments by LCC relating to Buckshaw Parkway: ‘We welcome the improvement to the calls at this station providing earlier services from the station and additional peak services providing additional commuting opportunities for this expanding community.’\nThese build on the more modest service changes that are being introduced this December and are a stepping stone to the more significant timetable changes that will take place in December 2019 when all the infrastructure upgrades will be complete and the new rolling stock introduced.\nA couple of days ago I met up with Simon and Jack from RMGBuckshaw and below is a summary of our discussions. We meet regularly so if there are any items you would like raising, drop me a message. 👍🏻",

It’s great to see the competitors close up and be a small part of it all. And the sun came out ☀️\nMetal Fencing – Buckshaw Avenue\nAfter numerous requests for information, the latest update I have regarding the metal fencing across the front of Dominos is…\nThe premises are owned by Primrose Holdings who state that the fencing is up to help protect the grassed/ shrub area whilst Aldi create a number of crossing points as required by their planning permission. It is a temporary fix which will be removed when this happens.\nAs Aldi has been open for at least 12 months, I have asked whether there is a timescale on when this outstanding work will be complete and whether this is detailed in any agreed planning documents that enables enforcement action to be taken if required.\nPrimrose Hill School Visit\nReally enjoyable day today. First up a trip to County Hall for a meeting followed by a quick lunch. This afternoon started with a visit to Primrose Hill School in Euxton followed by 3 meetings with residents in Astley Village and a quick chat with the guys at RMGBuckshaw on my way home. Time for a quick coffee then off out tonight as well.\nDerian House Open Day\nAnother summers afternoon, another great cause to support – this time Derian House Open Day. The kids loved the outdoor activities whilst Sarah Jane and I found the tour really interesting with an insight into the amazing work that goes on at Derian House.\nTrinity Summer Fair – Buckshaw Village\nGreat family fun in the sun helping to run the Teddy Tombola this afternoon at the fantastic Trinity PFA Summer Fair. A big well done to the Trinity PFA team for a super day. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\nAstley Village Parish Council\nLast night I attended my first #Astley Village Parish Council meeting in my capacity as the Lancashire County Councillor. #MoreIssuesToChaseUp 👍🏻",

I have copied below some of the relevant sections of the most recent responses from officers to illustrate the decision-making process.\nI am disappointed that I have not been able to get this scheme delivered for you (yet), however I will continue to seek solutions and I will work with the relevant portfolio holders and officers to identify funding opportunities as and when they become available.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 27 April.\nWhilst both elected divisional county councillor and cabinet member for highways and transportation may respond to a petition; I can confirm that we have not received a response in respect to the petition regarding extending the double yellow lines on Village Way, Buckshaw Village.\nObservations have been carried out on Village Way, Buckshaw Village on the following dates:\n3 March 2017 AM drop off\n17 March 2017 PM pick up\n28 March 2017 PM pick up\n20 April 2017 AM drop off\nThe presence of parked vehicles within urban areas is a common occurrence and can result in lower traffic speeds due to the requirement for vehicles to give way to opposing traffic flows. Village Way at this location features excellent visibility of oncoming traffic in both directions and we would expect approaching vehicles to comply with procedures laid down in the Highway Code to ensure that they do not come into conflict with other road users. Village Way currently is currently subject to an advisory 20mph speed limit during school start and finish times with a mandatory speed limit of 30mph outside of these times.\nObservations carried out to date have revealed that vehicles are approaching the crossing location with appropriate caution and that the location is currently operating satisfactorily in terms of road safety which is supported by the historical lack of incidents in the vicinity.\nInformation provided by the Police confirms that the incident referred to occurred on Sunday 5 March 2017 with the Police in attendance at 14:31hrs. The driver of the vehicle was detained at the scene for a drink driving offence and there is no association between the circumstances of this incident and weekday school traffic or parking behaviour at the location.\nI appreciate our decision is disappointing we have a responsibility to allocate our finite resources based up on greatest need.\nAs the highway authority we have a finite budget and a responsibility to prioritise our resources that best serve the residents and road users in Lancashire. Our current priority is to target those resources at locations with significant numbers of injury accidents, in addition to schemes that will contribute to the improvement of the highway network.\nThe road safety record at this location is good with no recorded injury accidents occurring in the past 5 years or longer. Notwithstanding your constituents concerns, when we have locations that do have a history of collisions causing injury and sadly fatalities that are competing for funding for traffic schemes, it would be remiss of the county council to divert the limited funding we have to locations that do not. Therefore we are unable to support further measures at this junction at the present time.\n——————————————–\nDear County Councillor Riggott\nI refer to your email of 18 May.\nThe councils commitment is to prioritise funding on fulfilling our statutory responsibility of maintaining a safe highway network. We have seen reductions in both available budget and staff and our limited resources, in particular to traffic related issues we are focussed in delivering schemes which has a demonstrable positive impact in reducing casualty figures; it would therefore be remiss of the council to consider delivering traffic schemes at locations where there is a good safety record when there are still so many locations with very poor accident statistics currently waiting and competing for funding for schemes. This is the mandate set by the council and as such it is not within officers discretion to consider delivering schemes which does not fulfil our prioritisation strategy.\nFollowing on from this meetings with members is very resource intensive and a county council directive was issued nearly 2 years ago which acknowledged this in light of the much reduced staffing levels the county council now supports with an increased demand in services. Site visits are only considered if they will be mutually beneficial i.e. we have funding options or the officer needs a better understanding of the issue at hand. Neither criteria falls within your requests for visits as officers fully understand the issues at hand and notwithstanding your desire for a positive way forward we have no scheme options and our position would be unchanged despite meeting and therefore we are unable to justify that it is a good use of our finite resources.",

Without them, Buckshaw Youth Association would not exist.\nI must thank all those who joined the team to volunteer their time including Simon from RMGBuckshaw, PCSO Ray Chadwick, local resident Vicky Thompson and Michelle Graham from Chorley Youth Zone. Again I must thank our home grown former members Heather Watson, Jack Grover, Alice Reeves, Harvey Taylor and Chelsea Edgington who help lead the sessions on a Friday evening.\nOnce again we were joined by the team from MACY (Music & Arts for Creative Youth) ably led by Zoe and Marie who ran their popular wide variety of craft and creative projects, with support from wider members of the MACY team to bringing in karaoke sessions and drama workshops.\nAt Christmas we joined forces with many organisations including The BVCA ( Buckshaw Village Community Association ), Buckshaw Village Church, Friends of Buckshaw Village, RMG, SJL Heating & Plumbing, Buckshaw Leaflet Distribution and many others to hold the first combined Christmas Event in Buckshaw Village. It was a fabulous and highly memorable occasion that will be tough to beat next time around and I would personally like to thank all those involved who made it happen. I would also like to thank local Councillors Debra Platt and Mark Jarnell for their grants towards the cost of the Christmas tree.\nWe once again have been issuing Lancashire Time Credits to volunteers and have issued in excess of 200 Time Credits this year. Our Facebook page (now with 185 Likes) is proving popular in keeping parents informed of our weekly activities and opening dates, as is our Twitter account.\nFinally I must once again thank Alan Platt for the continued variety his purchasing brings to our tuck shop, Lee Williams for his never ending mopping and sweeping on a Friday night and for the good humour they both bring as well as the support and advice they offer to those members leading the Friday evening sessions.
