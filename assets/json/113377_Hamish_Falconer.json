We are a city of invention, resilience and pride. A city that built the tank, trained the RAF, and helped turn the tide of history. Today, that same spirit lives on – in every classroom, care ward, workshop and community centre.\nMy job is simple: to serve that spirit, to fight for Lincoln, and to make sure no one in our city is left behind.\nWhether it’s an issue with housing, benefits, immigration, healthcare or anything else, my team and I are here to help. As your MP, my job is to support constituents wherever I can – and to make sure your voice is heard in Westminster.\nIf you’re unsure whether I’m your local MP, you can check using your postcode below.",
